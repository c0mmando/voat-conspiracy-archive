            I am shocked to see how compliant and corrupt these smart people are. Apparently they forgot about their "data" and "science" in favour of their political beliefs. It is surprising to see their posts which follow the herd narrative; hardly distinguishable from the average social twitter. When I challenged their support of mask wearing with documents, they either ignored or blocked me!

            Scientists can manipulate the statistics and even conduct the experiment with specific agenda to come out as the result. When the politicians quote science as the reason behind their current push for a draconian policy, I just assume some scientist sold their morality for money again. I wouldn't necessarily give them the credit of wielding the power of life and death, but they sure do contribute to the confusion, misdirection, and misguidance of the mass from their flawed studies. The unnecessary suffering of countless human souls will be weighed against them eventually when people catch up to the fact that they've been fooled.

             I was shocked to read that at least 50% of the published findings could not be independently reproduced or replicated. I saw on twitter published data which could only be the result of deliberate forgeries.

             Not corrupt; but having to toe the line. Most people know this; former govt employees have plainly stated that.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, there is a difference in having to remain silent to protect their careers, and actually publicly supporting a govt's line.

            The older I get, the less I trust science. There is a lot we cannot predict with scientific models. It sucks that you get labeled as a crack-pot conspiracy theorist if you disagree with popular science.

             What is the big deal about labels. We all know when people can't attack the message they attack the messenger. Even on social media. When people could not refute my statements or questions, they hissed at my account handle names!

            I got out of my psych degree when I realized that 80% of the research papers had contradictions between their written conclusions and their data going back 30 years from now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The most egregious cases are in sociology studies or para-psychology. About every 5-7 years we see studies on divorce rates and they often focused, for 40 years on the number of sex partners before marriage, researchers know this is critical to marital success like no other factor but globally since the 90s they'll give their expectations in deceptive ways and then lie about their results in the conclusions of every paper but the raw data shows that one sexual partnerbother than your spouse prior to marriage increases a woman's probability of divorce to 48%, for your average virgin it's 2% every partner after the first sinful union increases the odds of divorce by 2-6% some women interviews in the most recent research had divorce rates over 220% and the data bore it out that they already had multiple divorces or were never married.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pursued this in some papers I wrote and next semester all the requirements for graduation were changed to require a bunch of brand new social justice courses about feminism.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was prepared to bail on it already but with those measures i knew that they didn't want men in the field because it lacked a male perspective but because they wanted to use my presence in the field as validation they could tout to the public whenever they hocked blatant lies about the data they gathered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scientific literacy is a crisis in the US and much of the world, just as the common catholic didn't speak latin and The Word wasn't given to them to study so that many priests could abuse their flock's faith for gain, so too now do scientists and science journals do the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            On all sides there are egregious abusers who gaslight about science from a position of authority and on the flip side there are vodoo priests who use reasonable mistrust of science to hock snake oil or gaslight for political reasons, or just to satiate their own selfish attention seeking behavior invent lies common people can't or wont debunk; in the chaos of it all foreign rivals and enemies deepen the distrust with disinfo campaigns and psyops to cause us to harm ourselves. All of this is the fault of censorship anywhere and everywhere and also schools failing to well educate students because they are bogged down being babysitting for niggers, the presence of niggers has dumbed our schools down to their level because graduating them somehow matters more than teaching the next generation well.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we don't turn violently away from this cliff we deserve to go over it and perish.

             Since most people had multiple sex partners before marriage, if they get married, that explains the high divorce rates.

             As soon as I remember myself, I just knew by myself to not trust deflowered females and call them bitches. After I learned psychology, I understand that avoiding deflowered females is not based on IQ, but on mere inborn instincts of self preservation, because without the sense of intimacy, the instincts of love and fidelity don't work and makes people get divorced. This small paragraph can save the majority of people from losing virginity promiscuously and end in divorce.

                Considering they are irredeemable I don't see how to treat polluted women any other way than as enemies, they wont mind when we're in power, these are the same broken women who vote for rapists to invade their countries because it makes their nethers tingle.

                Threats of being exiled to africa or tied to radiators in an incell's basement will probably make them just as horny.

                These "victims" can't be allowed to poison the next generation.

                The solution most folks don't want to hear is that we stem this flood of whores with a break water up river. Average age of first sexual encounter was 14 about 10 years ago, it's about 12 years and 8 months for most girls now. You can call this rape but these are self initiated experiences often times, often with underage boys.
               </p>
               <p>
                The solution is multifaceted; sex segregation in schools from age 7 all the way up, ending the existing collegiate system and just increasing the length of our public education system by about 2 years, this will also imprive education so young men of age 22-25 can actually establish themselves and take a wife by this time. The above factors should raise average age of loss of virginity, The age of the girls they aught to be marrying should be young enough that they haven't had time to soil their virginity. Obviously no union should progress without full consent of parents, ideally more people would attend church functions and meet their prospective spouses there and be able to network better to establish themselves. Peoole in the past understood this, before the suffragist movement only socialites were waiting until they were over 20 to marry even for them that was considered old, most pioneer marriages happened before 18. There is a reason a 13 year old can get married in south carolina it's the same reason Mary Mother of Christ was married at 12 or 13 and a mither by age 14. This average age of first sexual experience has never deviated that much above or below 13 and in societies where a woman's value was determined by virginity because everyone knew a whorish wife would be trouble they married them young. Legal age of marriage was set at 13 in south carolina for a number of reasons, to enable the process of a shotgun wedding if it's found two kids have fooled around and crossed a sacred line, poor families to be able to remove the cost of a daughter before she might turn to prostitution and likely they understood God had resolved the age of consent issue when placed his seed in Mary.

                Women define themselves by their actions and if you never let them off a narrow path and give them a good perception of their situation by comparing it to failing civilizations they will be happy.

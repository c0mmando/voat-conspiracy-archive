Why did a 14 year old tower (on 9/11) collapse due to fire when it would have been subject to much higher building standards and codes, the material would be more newer and therefore stronger, and the construction time was longer, which usually means that when the concrete was poured, it had longer time to set, which means that it gets stronger. If I know anything about concrete construction, it\'s that the more time you allow it to set, the stronger it gets. </p>

<p>The temperature in Grenfell got up to 1,000 celsius. Do you know what else did as well? The twin towers. All though this is about the WTC 7 specifically, it\'s claimed that debris from the twin towers fell and started a fire.

<p>Even at the fundamentals, the basic materials for Grenfell and WTC 7 would be the same. Steel that\'s concreted (as steel improves tension in concrete) for the columns, and generally steel for the floors (if it were to be concreted, it\'d be heavy). </p>

<li>
<p>While WTC 7 looked great on the outside, Grenfell looks horrible, though this can be attributed to the material they used when panelling the exterior.

You\'d think that glass might break due to being in an environment like WTC 7 where there\'s shit burning at massive temperatures. </p>

            Or how the radio tower begins to tilt &amp; drop ahead of the "pancake" collapse, the upper portion begins to rotate into an asymmetrical downfall, yet then magically acts as the pylon to pulverize 100 stories of steal beams and 100
            <em>
             very
            </em>
            large, thick concrete floors. And ultimately pulverize itself (ironically, it pulverizes itself at the start of the collapse, and is all but gone as the rest of the building continues to dismember itself into dust). I could go on.

            I'm not so sure about that story of the heroic passengers.  Apparently, there was no evidence of a plane at the alleged crash site in PA.  See Christopher Bollyn's work on this topic for more info.

             I followed Bollyn's work for a long time, even donated to it, his research is excellent stuff. As you may already know - He reached the point where an unmarked, undercover Chicago-area police squad roughed him up at night, tased the shit out of him, then charged him with assaulting a police officer.

            I have no i terest in discussing it. Its not that I cant, i wont. It is a waste of my time. Your mind is made up. It has been for years. The entire theory starts w a conclusion and works backwards fitting evidence to support the conclusion they started w.  Which is not how a real investigation of anything works.

             AE911 does the exact opposite of what you describe here. They look at the event, and run parallel hypothesis', one for destruction by fire, and one for destruction by demolition. I highly recommend you take a look and compare the differences in there investigation.

             And if you stopped looking at 9/11 after Popular Mechanics

             debunked Loose Change, you've missed out on
             <em>
              A LOT

             of useful evidence for which people have drawn different conclusions than that of the underfunded &amp; understaffed NIST 9/11 Investigation which is observed to have flawed science in multiple regards.

            Grenfell - Was affected by a fire
           </p>
           <p>
            WTC7 - Spent over 70% of its collapse travelling at free fall acceleration - this was not and cannot be related to a fire. Office fires cannot make structural elements effectively disappear which is required for free fall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even the NIST reports / computer models could not reproduce the free fall speeds observed on the day, even after they fudged their models by removing supports, removing rivets from the beam connectivity, weakening the steel and exaggerating the extent of the fires in the final models. In the end, and this is documented officially, that they only modeled the initiation of the collapse and not the entirety of the event. Which is kind of like ending an air crash investigation after working out the engines stopped working at 40k feet.

            IMO as WTF 7 was an FBI and CIA operations hub - documented and verified - used to spy on foreign delegates in the country, and Mayor Rudi Gulliani's emergency reponse / crisis centre. This was the control centre for the pyrotechnics display we saw that day and had to be 'pulled'. 'Lucky' Larry Silverstein had a great day that day I will tell you.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you are probably aware 'pulling' a building is an industry term for demolishion which takes months of planning and lots of explosives.

            I think the simple explanation that more closely follows Occam's razor is that WTC 7 threatened to become the source of a blazing inferno that would spread across downtown (which couldn't be dealt with due to thinned resources) and was consequently "pulled".
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason you won't know who ordered/carried it out (or even admission that it was) until the 9/11 report is declassified is to protect the people responsible for it from being the targets of hundreds of lawsuits.

             The only way it could be possible to make a last minute decision to "pull" a building, is if the building have been pre-rigged with explosives.  How many other buildings do you think have been secretly pre-rigged for demolition?

            Oh youre right, i didnt read very carefully. No that building was crushed w falling, burning debris. Youve had a decade and thousands of people looking at this and youve got nothing. You ignore the simplest answer that it was simply allowed to happen in favor of holograms and RC airliners. You guys dont need the CIA to label you conspiracy wackjobs, you take care of that yourselves. Ive looked at your evidence a decade ago, it isnt evidence.

             Except that was put out a few hours later. Still collapsed, in a free-fall motion where the supports gave away simultaneously. As one guy from IRC said, you'd think you'd see partial collapses, but you don't. It's all one big collapse at the same time.

            <p>
             Also, this tower burned for over a day. No collapse.

            Because they are complety and utterly different structures using diffenent materials and a different construction technique. Something you tards have been reminded of repeatedly. There also that whole thing where an airplane loaded w fuel hit one and the other was a simple fire. Youre comparing apples to hedgehogs.

           Because our society is organized in a way where money is gotten by exchanging labor. But we have arrived at a time in history where there's a shortage of jobs due to automation and outsourcing, so there are many who simply cannot get access to a reliable income stream to survive. So

          <p>
           Automation is happening because of the development of technology, which has to do with the human desire to control our environment. This desire seems to be in our genes, but we could probably culturally un-learn it over hundreds of years with effort. Globalization of the labor pool is allowed by technology too, airplanes and internet which allow for geographical distances to be less and less important. Because they have more money, companies can move locations more easily than citizens, and can manipulate law itself more easily than citizens.
           <em>

          <p>
           "I don't know. Stop asking why. It is what it is." say some who want to mentally check out when things get too deep, throwing out their preferred thought-terminating cliches.
          </p>
          <p>
           But if globalism is made possible by technology, and technology comes from our desires to control our environment, and we can't find jobs because of automation and globalization,  then
           <em>
            why
           </em>
           do we in effect keep desiring things that end up hurting us? Are we really that short-sighted? And/or are our genetic predispositions
           <em>
            that

            Someday, probably soon Earthlings will have to figure out how to live on another planet.
Other than that option there will have to be a great big Culling of undesirables. There are millions of Muslims that need to be gone. That's a good start.

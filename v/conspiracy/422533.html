            So... we're to posit some nebulous group of posters, who have been rumored to have done some thing in the past, and we're to assume that they're certainly only going to cause harm, and so, for the good of the community, mods should be ready to "remove illegal content" and "identify trolls" in response to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gosh.  Where have I heard that sort of thing before?  Where in the relatively recent past did I see a group of people identify some other group of people as a nascent threat and insist that, for the good of the community, those people need to be dealt with?
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh yeah... that's right.  It was on Reddit.  In fact, that attitude - that presumption by one group of posters that targeting another group of posters was necessary for the good of the community - was exactly what turned it into a shithole I stopped going to.

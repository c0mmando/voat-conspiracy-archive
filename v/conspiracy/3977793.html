            Thanks for the insight.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm trying to figure out WHY it's so important to stick that 'test taking stick" into the nose and not the mouth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Having a hard time imagining a virus living it up in the nasal canals of the human body but choosing to NOT live in that same hosts mouth... come on wtf?!
           </p>
           <p>
            But if both spots can work, and they're making such a big deal to do it THIS way, WHAT is it they are trying to achieve???  As I've gotten older, I've really began to understood the value behind "No one does anything for free, everything has a price/reason.  Which means that if doctors are fighting among one another and making their voices/concerns known, over how important it is to stick the damn stick/pipette up the nose instead of the mouth, and in the process piss off their own patients and simply make things harder compared to simply taking a swab test from the inside of the mouth...
           </p>
           <p>
            what are they doing? are they giving something to the people they swab test?

             That's right. They put the stick in the nose just to make people suffer.

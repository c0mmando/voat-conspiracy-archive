            Well one thing is for certain, when one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world is making statements like this it doesn't bode well for the little people. Plus the big banks such as Goldman-Sachs and Federal Reserve short-selling gold in 2013 using naked shorts to drastically lower the price of gold before buying it in up in bulk. This is a bad bad sign.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just in case you're unaware, a short is when an investor thinks the price of a stock or commodity is going to fall and a naked short is when the short seller does not have or borrow the item that he shorts, but sells shorts regardless. In the paper gold market, the participants are betting on gold prices and are content with the monetary payment. In other words, with naked shorts, no physical metal is actually sold.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something big and bad is coming down the pipeline and I really do fear that too many people swallow the MSM and disregard talk of this nature as "tinfoil hat nonsense" to be able to do anything about it before it's too late.

             Sorry for my ignorance on this, but what did Rothschild say about the market? I can't seem to pinpoint what if being referred to here and I want to learn more. I've heard about the bankers and am entirely suspicious with that alone, but I'm also very interested in knowing what Rothschild stated that is pulling all of these deaths to light.

               Keiran Toman, 39, former banker who believed he was being stalked by a reality TV crew starved to death in a hotel room, after leaving the "do not disturb" sign on door for TWO weeks. [Highly suspicious claims, as many of us probably know that the hotel cleaning staff will knock on the door after 24 hours and eventually enter the room if failing to respond]. An inquest was opened after his death in July 2010 but his family asked for a second hearing as they were not informed. Police found all of Mr Toman's possessions in the room, but despite documents mentioning his family, failed to tell them he had died. - Reference.

               Nicholas Austin, 49, A former bank manager from Hersden died after drinking antifreeze in an effort to "get high". was found in a coma by his wife Lynn at their home in Blackthorne Road on October 5. He died the same day. – Reference. "I took special note of the last one – he died drinking antifreeze in an attempt to "get high"! Funny one that is, as if a banker would be stupid enough to try that. The list is shocking, I never saw so many suicides and car accidents. No gall bladder stones, cancer deaths, strokes, or simply falling ill, it is just a litany of action. That pretty much says it all." – Jim Stone Freelance

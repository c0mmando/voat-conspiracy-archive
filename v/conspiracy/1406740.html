            Yes, they're "overplayed". The pyramids are completely explicable within what is known about Egypt.

            the explanations of all that stuff in the book were more interesting than the main spaceship story.  I still need to get into the second book though.  There's other stuff throughout the world that can only he seen from either from space or flight.  So were they talking to imaginary gods or were there "people" up there that they saw flying around?

            Ancestors were masters masons. We can't build stone pyramids or anything like it with our modern tech. I think they are pretty worthy of awe.

            why not? there's some pretty cool stuff put there that would require some serious thought amd discussion on how it came to be.  Thought provoking stuff seems to have disapeared from tv.

             if there was a worker/slave every 2 square feet I don't see how it could have been built in a few years, also one fucking mistake and you would see it!

            The builders were likely educated and trained in architecture and more like "blue collar" middle class workers than "slaves"

            slaves would not be able to do the "laser" precision work but would be much better at the raw manpower to most importantly provide food and deliver raw materials to the artisans.

            Careful what you're thinking... You don't want have to commit suicide! Anyhow, interesting point. Do you have any other examples beyond the Elloea?

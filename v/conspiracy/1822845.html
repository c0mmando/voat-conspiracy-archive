            nailed it, but if you're looking for a little entertainment with you father...
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask him to read through Revelation and going only by the book's own defining features of "End Times Babylon" which countries fit the description?
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond that the whole "Synagogue of Satan", when there's no "Church of" or "Mosque of Satan".... I mean the term church is used elsewhere in the Bible, we do get warnings about False Prophets but nobody is singled out like the Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's another thing, theistic Jews that haven't converted to Christianity hate Christ and Christianity. The Bible says flat out (paraphrased not direct quote) "You can't have God the Father without God the Son which is Jesus"/"You reject one you reject the other"... That and Christians aren't supposed to fellowship with non-believers, especially non-believers who hate them. It's one thing to try to minister to them or something, entirely different to think of them as "friends"...... So his whole Zionistic "friend of Israel" thing he's got going on....... Not very Christian.
           </p>
           <p>
            If he's really devout and you want to help him see the light, you've got to meet him on his level. You've got to use the Bible to reach him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something else you might want to keep in mind, you won't be able to reach the vast majority of people you'd try to reach, on any issue, even if it's your life's goal. Jesus was "perfect", they were screaming for his blood before it was all said and done. You may never get through to him.

             I know that you're 10000000000% right. It's hard to reach people who are so sure of things. The only reason I even have considered doing this is because he and I seem to be of the same mold; when something doesn't set right, can't leave it alone out if sheer curiosity and need to know. Thank you so much for your response!

            Perfect. Let’s fix that heresy, shall we? Watch these two films (you can ignore everything after 1:17:00 in Marching to Zion because it’s not accurate) and them watch them with him so that you can point out specific things.

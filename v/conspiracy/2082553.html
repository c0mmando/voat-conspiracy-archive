people are fukcing lazy, and without advertising, would use the same phone forever. the tech sector stalls easily.

            microsoft had to invest in apple, it was the only way to spur competition, and avoid legalities.
           </p>
           <p>
            and why does everyone act like IBM, Oracle, Big Red H, etc. don't exist?
these are major fracking players in the world of information and hardware.

            Didn't Microsloth prop up Apple financially ages ago? I remember them investing or buying shares in the early Jobbs days. Just too lazy to look it up. I agree with you wholeheartedly, especially when it is proven they rigged the employment market to drive down wages in the tech field. Why would they not conspire on many other projects.
           </p>

            I have been waiting for a Linux platform for mobile for ages and would be happy to give it a go. But Ubuntu has hardly progressed and I know of no other projects in the works. Was kind of excited for Firefox OS as it was based on hybrid web based apps but that went nowhere. It perplexes me that there is no open source or at least GNU OS on the market. Not a mobile dev but I would imagine it has to do with complexity of mobile components and the lack of support from the manufacturers.

            Well, the HAVE been busted for collusion already, so not exactly far-fetched.  Skeptically, it's probably that they're in two different businesses.  Apple is a hardware company and increasingly a services company (subscriptions to imusic, icloud storage, etc).  Google is a data mining company.  Search engines and webmail make sense for Google in that context and far less so for Apple.  Apple does make their own search functions (siri) when needed, rather than letting Google be involved, but they don't make a web version because their business plan does not have a way to cash in on that data.  Advertising is a small business for Apple and they've not shown any ability there.  Google's monopoly positions are already post-peak and will fade more rapidly going forward.  The architecture of information and data is changing and that impacts them negatively - Amazon is actually a bigger threat to them than Apple in their core businesses.

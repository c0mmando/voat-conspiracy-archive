            <p>
             An Oklahoma Judge is refusing to hear testimony from a 9/11 conspirator who claims he received assistance from a Saudi prince in his “Islamic terrorist activities.”
            </p>
            <p>
             U.S. District Judge Vicki Miles-Lagrange dismissed the case after imprisoned al-Qaida terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui failed to pay a $400 filing fee and never asked to have the fee waived, reports
             <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-city-judge-tosses-zacarias-moussaouis-lawsuit/article/5431947">
              The Oklahoman.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             In October Moussaoui, who is currently serving a life sentence with no possibility of release for conspiring with the 9/11 hijackers and al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden to attack America, mailed a hand written letter to Oklahoma City federal court where he asked the judge to let him testify in open court about assistance he claims he received from a Saudi prince.
            </p>
            <p>
             He claims he met with the Saudi prince at the University of Oklahoma in 2001 to receive flight lessons, reports The Oklahoman.
            </p>
            <p>
             In another letter mailed in November, Terrorist Moussaoui asked the Oklahoma judge to appoint him an attorney so he can sue President Barack Obama for obstruction of justice. He claimed the Obama administration is trying to prevent him from testifying on behalf of 9/11 victims in their 2003 civil case against Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also penned a letter in May of this year asking to have a attorney assist him in exposing “the bigger conspiracy behind 9/11,” according to The Oklahoman’s report.
            </p>
            <p>
             Zacarias Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota in August 2001 after he raised suspicion at a flight school there. He was still incarcerated on September 11, 2001 when three sky scrappers hit ground zero in New York city.
            </p>
            <p>
             Federal judges in Florida, Colorado and Texas also have refused to consider similar legal demands from the 9/11 conspirator.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to The Oklahoman, Moussaoui is cooperating with attorneys suing Saudi Arabia. He reportedly answered their questions under oath in October while in prison.
            </p>
            <p>
             His testimony at that time focused mostly on his claim that prominent members of Saudi Arabia’s royal family were major donors to bin Laden in the late 1990s. He testified in October that he created a digital database of donors for bin Laden and remembers some names because they were “extremely famous.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Currently there are calls from U.S. congressmen to have the Obama Administration
             <a href="http://28pages.org/">
              release 28 classified pages
             </a>
             from the 2002 report of a joint congressional inquiry on 9/11.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 28 pages were concealed from the public by the Bush administration and are suspected to contain information revealing that one or more foreign governments was involved in assisting some of the hijackers in their preparation for 9/11. Saudi Arabia is one of the main suspects in this suspicion.
            </p>
            <p>
             On June 1, 2015, Senator Rand Paul (R, KY) introduced
             <a href="http://28pages.org/senate-bill/">
              Senate Bill 1471
             </a>
             , the Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims and Survivors Act, which urges the president to declassify 28 pages.

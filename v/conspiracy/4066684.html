            Copy/paste from Miles Mathis:
           </p>
           <p>
            John Belushi (wikipedia) During his career he had a
           </p>
           <p>
            close personal and artistic partnership with fellow SNL
           </p>
           <p>
            actor and writer Dan Aykroyd whom he met at Chicago’s
           </p>
           <p>
            Second City comedy club.
           </p>
           <p>
            Belushi died on the morning of March 5, 1982 at the age of 33 in
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollywood, California...He was posthumously honored with a
           </p>
           <p>
            star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on April 1, 2004.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note the numerology. Belushi’s autopsy was performed
           </p>
           <p>
            by notorious LA coroner Thomas Noguchi, who Miles
           </p>
           <p>
            has already outed in his Manson paper. Noguchi faked the autopsies of many famous people, including Belushi, Sharon Tate, William Holden, and Natalie Wood. Then there’s Tom Schiller’s “ironic” short film depicting Belushi as the last surviving cast member. And this….
           </p>
           <p>
            (chicagotribune.com) Martha's Vineyard tamed wild comic John Belushi When people think of the Vineyard, they tend to associate it with eminent figures such as Robert McNamara, the former secretary of defense, or playwright Lillian Hellman. Certainly not with the likes of Belushi...They bought a beachfront house here in 1979 (from McNamara, no less). After Belushi died of a drug overdose, in Los Angeles, in 1982, it was in Abel's Hill Cemetery here that he was buried (his grave is near Hellman's).
           </p>
           <p>
            Pisano [Belushi's wife], 54, lived in New York for several years after Belushi's death, then returned to the island and bought a new house, in Vineyard Haven, in 1986.
           </p>
           <p>
            She remarried in 1990. Her husband was a fellow islander, Victor Pisano, a television executive and restaurateur. "There's always something going on to do with John," Pisano says. She and the
           </p>
           <p>
            other Blues Brother, Dan Aykroyd, are partners in the House of Blues chain of nightclubs. There's licensing of his image, and he remains a frequent presence on "SNL" retrospectives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Editor: given that Noguchi's presence indicates Belushi faked his death for some reason—maybe just to retire—we have to ask if others who died young did the same thing. Others like Gilda Radner, Chris Farley, Andy Kaufman, Charles Rocket, John
           </p>
           <p>
            Candy, Jan Hooks, and Phil Hartman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although we are told John is Albanian, the Belushi name was originally Belliors, which doesn't sound Albanian. Both Belushi and wife Judith Jacklin started out working for the National Lampoon. So we have that connection again. By the way, Judith
           </p>
           <p>
            Jacklin is a Jewish name. Belushi's grandmother is named Vasilo Manika, which, according to Ancestry.com, is a Jewish name. Manika is also a region of Zimbabwe, near Mashonaland, both of which were founded by Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company for the extraction of minerals. I will be told that the names Manika and
           </p>
           <p>
            Mashona are African, but more research ties them back to Judaism. For instance, the Mashona are descended from black Jews of Abyssinia [Harald von Sicard, 2007]. The same applies to the Manyika, both the people and the language being just a subset of
           </p>
           <p>
            Shona, or Mashona. So both names are Jewish, not African. By the way, Rhodes is also Jewish. He was financed by the Rothschilds, and this is admitted. Some still try to deny that Rhodes was Jewish, but those denying it need to explain why he was the top donor to synagogues in South Africa.

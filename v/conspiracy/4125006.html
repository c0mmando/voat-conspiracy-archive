           <p>
            I moved to Austin Texas for a while from California while I was kid. Grades 3-5.
           </p>
           <p>
            In California my parents took me to the Dr to get vaxxed.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Texas, where I had an adverse reaction to vaccines they did it in school without notifying the parents..
           </p>
           <p>
            They lined us up just like cattle on a big ranch.
           </p>
           <p>
            I rember some kid fighting, kicking and screaming. They forced them in line and made them get vaxxed. That school was k-3 so the kid was from 5-9 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            I almost went deaf. I did have the most painful experience of my entire life from it. My mom took me to the Dr, but no one ever associated it with the vax. It was sent until years later when I met someone who did go deaf from a vaccine that I realized what happened to me because the adverse events often happen within a few weeks of the jab, not moments later. Two things happened to me shortly after that vaccination. One is shortly after I had chills and fever, very common. Shortly after that I was abrubtly awoken from my sleep screaming from the pain in my left ear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kids have not developed the part of the brain that thinks about long term consequences so they are almost incapable of lining up effects with causes. If my mom HAD been informed that we were vaxxed in school she probably would've figured it out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know another guy who described an event like I experienced which is sudden deafness accompanied by a he most painful experience of his life. He went practicality deaf in both ears. Requires a hearing aid. Happened at the same age. Probably vaxxed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of peoples physical issues/conditions are probably vax related and they don't even know it. Things like allergies, asthma, deafness, vision probs, autoimmune conditions, all sorts of things can be attended bites to vaccinations but people think it just happened out of nowhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing happens out of nowhere, that is a fact. Nothing happens without a cause causing it.

             sorry to hear about that... but thanks for sharing. this is exactly why everyone needs to pull their kids from public school RIGHT NOW if they're not already homeschooling.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe this jab is engineered to permanently sterilize all recipients. (among whatever other terrible adverse reactions)

              I agree, and I do homeschool my kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              I always wanted to anyway, but when my son was in second grade we moved to a new school district right after gov brown snuck SB 51 in which case as no more exmptions for public or private school kids. That was a no brainier for me. I have no regrets. It's also comfortable to know he is not being indoctrinated, but it's also not too difficult to get an excellent education at home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Schools suck so it's not today hard, but also with the internet it's so much easier. We do something along the lines of unschooling.
             </p>
             <p>
              It has also strengthened our relationship and our family/father-son bonds. Those 8 hours a day that I would be away at work and while he'd be in school we now spend together doing productive things. I'm a single parent so I have had to make adjustments and sacrifices as far as work etc goes. But it has all worked out for the better for sure.

               that's awesome! We never put a name on it, but it sounds like we "unschool" too. Our focus is on real-world skills and self-sufficiency. My wife has always been a crazy-reader (we have as many books as an elementary school library. So she teaches the reading/writing portion. I do math and science and history. and we both do real-world training. All of my sons know how to build and repair almost anything. My daughters are all experts in home economics. All of my kids are 2 grades ahead of their age with the math/science stuff. They know the memorization stuff we thought was important - state capitals/country capitals/presidents names/periodic table kind of stuff, but we also tailor each kid's learning to what interests them and which subjects we think they need to double-down on. We tried to teach them all a musical instrument and make them all play sports and found that 3 really like sports, 2 really like music and 2 really don't care for either but are really into art.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the shots, our oldest 2 started at public school and got all the shots but the rest are all toxin-free and will literally only get them OVER MY DEAD BODY. and I live out in the wilderness with a very long driveway and several dogs. I'll have enough warning if/when they show up that I can at least make a stand.

                Awesome! Sounds very similar to us. We're out in the wilderness too, 7th grade doing highschool level science. I have older kids that were vaccinated too. My son has read more novels at this point than most American adults have. He has read way more than I did at his age. I had him doing snapshot world geography reports to learn countries around the world their Capitols, national anthems rivers and bodies of water, population, official languages and religions and what their money is called.  He would have to look up all the info, list it all, and draw a picture of the country and name the countries that it shares borders with. I'm going to have him do something similar with the 50 states of the US this year.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is so good to hear from other parents who can identify with the experience I've been having instead of people who think homeschooling is bad and is not as good as a state indoctrination in one of the most toxic environments imaginable (public school) it is so shocking that people believe that that is some how better!!!
               </p>
               <p>
                But lots of people who doubted me at the begining can now not deny that not only is my son intelligent, but he is at least as educated as he would be at a public school, and without all the toxic behavior and mindsets he would be picking up in that unnatural environment.
               </p>
               <p>
                You should look up unschooling and check it out just for the sake of it. It sounds like your doing great with what your doing though.
               </p>
               <p>
                Have you seen Captain Fantastic???  If not do check it out. Stupid name but a great film.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think over all it might be a NWO propoganda flick but I can't really tell. Most movies I can tell.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's about a family deep o. The woods of Washington that try to live outside of society. The kids are all homeschooled and brilliant.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is one scene where theyre visiting their family in mainstream society. It comes up that the kids don't know what Nikes or Adidas are so the aunt becomes concerned and starts lecturing the dad about sending his kids to a real school where they can get a real education.
               </p>
               <p>
                So at that, the homeschool dad asks her kids who attend public school about the bill of rights. The 8th grader shrugs and says it's some government thing, the high schooler does not elaborate much better.
               </p>

                The homeschool dad then calls his 8 year old into the room and asks them about the bill of rights. At that the child starts to recite the BoR. The dad interrupts and says, No, no. Don't just regurgitate from memory, explain what it means I'm your own words" at which the 8 year old thinks and starts to give an oral easy on the meaning and impact of the bill of rights exhibiting a thorough understanding of what they had learned.

                Great movie. Check it out if you haven't seen it. I hardly watch movies and don't ever recommend them .

            The DC City Council passed the dangerous and predatory bill B23-0171 by a vote of 10:3 on Tuesday 11/17/2020. This law will not only permit children 11 years old and older to consent to vaccines on their own WITHOUT PARENTAL KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT, the bill requires insurance companies, vaccine providers and schools to CONCEAL the fact that the child has been vaccinated from the parent!! It also sets up these young children to be targets of bullying and coercion to be vaccinated behind their parents backs!
           </p>
           <p>
            There are multiple federal and local laws that will be broken by this new DC law (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, Religious Exemption to Vaccination). The law is also in conflict with Supreme Court precedent affirming parental rights, and it puts children’s health and safety at risk not only for serious reactions and even possible death, but it exposes children to be victims of under documented over-vaccination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mayor Bowser has up to 10 days to respond.  We need her to VETO this new law.  Please help her get the message loud and clear that America is watching and this is not an acceptable action by government!
           </p>
           <p>
            Contact DC Mayor Muriel Bowser IMMEDIATELY to VETO B23-0171 Vaccinating Children Behind Parents’ Backs

             I'm ok with them doing it in DC... it will only affect monkeys. If they mandate this in the democrat cities it'll mean the only ones sterilized are the subhumans. it'll never work in "flyover country" - we'll shoot them.

            It REALLY isn't; people think it has to take 8 hours a day because that is how school works. School doesn't work better HALF THE POINT is subsidized day care for working moms.  Unschooling is massively under rated as well (have your child follow you around and learn about what you are doing) IF you aren't sitting on ass at a computer all day

             It's SO MUCH BETTER. With only the right side of the bell curve in the classroom you can get through 3-4x the material in the same amount of time and of course those real-life skills you mentioned can be incorporated.

             My sons learned basic math by doing wood-working. My daughters did it by baking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every week we learn something new which contributes to self-sufficiency. My wife and daughters learned how to "glass eggs" last week. My sons brew beer with me using our own homegrown barley, wheat and hops which they help grow/tend. My oldest wants to start distilling whiskey but we have to build a still over the winter to get that project going.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've always had a "flexible schedule" but this "work-from-home" thing has been absolutely awesome for the homeschooling. We've covered so much more this school year than previous years. All of my kids are at least 2 grade levels beyond where they'd be in public school.

              Thanks for the window into the future.  My kids are 4,2, 1 month and this scamdemic has given me more motivation than ever to get us back to a rural area like where I grew up. The dirt is so shallow and the season so short where I live it is hard to grow but I have a a couple jars of frozen hops I will give to my brother for Christmas to see what he can do with them (makes mead/honey wine/cider).  We are going to get into micro greens more heavily this year (PSA Buy seeds NOW).

                 I'm not sure how cold it gets where you are... in my area the coldest of the cold days is -5ish and most years just hit 0 on the coldest day. We just use some older lightbulbs to heat the coop. as long as you have the opening face away from the wind this is enough to warm it up to a high enough temp for the hens to survive. They don't really lay much in that weather but they survive through it. We're more "hobby farmers" so I'm sure there are actual farmers with much better advice. maybe ask in

                  'preciate it!  I don't know if you meant Celsius or Fahrenheit but it doesn't matter because we regularly dip to -40 with wind chills for parts of three months.  I have a well built garage that maybe gets down to minus 15 with no heat so I think I can rig something up with plastic sheets and a heat lamp or two.  I am trying to connect with someone local who already has them (maybe I can over winter with them even).  This kind of talk is the great kind of stuff that happens/used to happen at so many kitchen tables and small town diners and if shit doesn't REALLY go down the tubes I am going to get my family back in the farm with in 2 years (probably in a NICE "mobile" home)

                   I admire folks who are hearty enough to live in those temperatures! I would never want to do it even though I guess part of my DNA is wired for it. (quarter-Viking)

                   I wish you luck! If you're looking for "greener pastures", there's fantastic land in middle-america which is cheap and significantly warmer. You can get 10 acres with a little home already on it for $200k in MO, KS, AR, TN.

                    You get used to the cold but I finally understood what "cabin fever" meant when I moved here is was REAL cold (and pretty dark) for a month +.  I am blessed enough to have a family property just bigger than that waiting, where the weeds even grow 6 feet tall!  I will have 3-5 kids in a pretty small living space but I don't care at all; Bison farming someday!

            The idea of chidren being able to provide their own consent is a HUGE goal of all the groups who want to abuse your children.  "Mental health" meds, vaccinnes, birth control, STD care, trans hormones, and finally SEX; imagine a world where children are legally allowed to provide consent to these

             Homosexuals still retain the option to procreate and women can jump out of the rat race before a certain age to have kids but a CHILD given these hormones becomes STERILE!  I think that fact is purposely un reported

             how is there a liability? you sign over your rights to your kids when you enroll them in public school and the vaccine companies are all exempt from lawsuits/consequences. If they can force your kid to wear a mask and hate their heritage surely they can inject them with toxins "for the good of the herd"

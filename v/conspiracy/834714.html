<blockquote>
<p>Hello my name is Alexander David Hooper. I am a United States citizen and my rights are being violated. I am bugged by federal agents that claim to be the FBI, CIA, and NSA. I have come in contact with these people several times beginning in San Francisco, to Los Angeles, to Phoenix, AZ, and Louisville, KY. I was bugged on February 19th, 2015. An unknown substance was given to me which was inserted into my body. Shortly after the federal agents began to communicate using that bug. On February 20th, 2015 these same people checked into the Spear Towers at 1 Spear &amp; Market in San Francisco. A security professional there joked about CIA being in the building at the check point. I cam into contact with this people during lunch, and the same gentleman that bugged me made an appearance in the afternoon. These people labeled me a target. I left San Francisco, and they threatened to kill me. One of their agents said I was just a kid and they didn\'t follow through. They have talked about what has been written to the FBI in front of me. My home was staked and they followed me throughout the city. All of them acknowledge either that &quot;he knows,&quot; or &quot;spot him,&quot; as soon as contact was made. The gentleman that bugged me was present again. I was driven from my home in San Francisco and left at fear of my life. I took a Greyhound from the city to Austin, TX to stay with family. The lay over in Los Angeles they recovered a backpack of mine that was thrown away. Nothing but personal nostalgia was thrown away including a breast cancer awareness patch, and my old Air Force base insignia. At the bus stop an older Caucasian man stared at me. They continued to talk among themselves via the bug. This same old man was seen again in Louisville, KY watching me outside of my work place. Boarding the bus I claimed a seat for myself, but ended up giving it to a woman that had a large dog accompanying her. I sat next to a woman I did not know. Outside of Phoenix, AZ on the Greyhound bus a ringleader made his presence known among four other people in particular. The ring leader was wearing a cowboy hat. Via the bug they spoke of handcuffs and arresting me for a reason I do not know at the next stop. A stop before Phoenix the ringleader spoke to several others telling them what to say. The woman next to me offered a bite to eat of her meal. I accepted politely not knowing the food was dusted with a rape drug. The woman made knowing responses of what was going on. When she threw herself on my I made my way to the restroom on the bus. Via the bug the federal agents laughed and stated that all Californians are the same. They laughed while raping me. I yelled emergency and got off the bus. Found the nearest home in the desert and called the police. They dropped me off at the nearest town in fear of getting in trouble. I called the FBI and reported that I was raped. In Phoenix I stayed the night at a shelter. Arriving there two people were present that were apart of the group on the bus responsible for raping me. That night I was bugged again. They claim to have a weapon pointed at my head and claimed if I were to move they would shoot me. They talked among themselves about other things as well. I found the bugs using water and needle noes pliers. I arranged with these people to have these bugs removed. To my understanding they just replaced them with something else. The first bug in my nasal canal is something they claim that will never disconnect. They have talked and confirmed a few things about the first bug. I know that it is an EMG/EEG device. EMG is a medical application that can assist people with nervous system problems or aid them with their prosthesis devices. In contrast to many other speech recording technologies, the major advantage of EMG is that it allows the recognition of non-audible, i.e. silent speech and non-audible murmur. They are able to attack my nervous system using it. They are able to rape me using it. I am being held against my will and they are raping me countless times. I am illegally being tortured. They have administered attacks as a tactic and out of spite. This has been a period of involuntary servitude. I cannot turn it off. It is connected to my body\'s physiology. They do not stop communicating via the bug. I choose not to communicate with these people, but it does not stop them from eaves dropping on my inner monologue. This is a violation of the 1st amendment. They have said, &quot;Thanks for testing the bug!&quot; and &quot;Nice working with you.&quot; I do not work with these people. I have not worked for the FBI, CIA, and NSA. This is a violation of my 13th amendment. I want to press slavery charges against these people. The violation of my 4th amendment is obvious. They talk via the bug using a speech program, and sometimes their actual voices. The difference is obvious between various computerized voices and my inner monologue. They have recorded my speech and have played it back to me. They are synthesizing my actual voice and using it how they wish without my permission. These people have attempted to set me up in various taboo ways. They have threatened to set me up with child pornography. They have claimed to be pedophiles. I am not a pedophile. They have threatened the life our President of the United States. I have reported these threats to the proper authorities many times. I write mainly to the FBI in San Francisco, CA and Seattle, WA. I have reported all of these threats to the FBI, CIA, DISA, The Secret Service, Homeland Security, The Obama Administration, my local congressman, and now the NSA. I have spoken to the Secret Service of Louisville, KY in person in hopes to find these people. I am still connected via the bugs and they still talk using it. I am not provoke by their threats and only wish to stop them. I am not a threat to another mans life. I am a victim of domestic terrorism caused by the radical federal agents attacking me. They have attacked me aboard aircraft, driving, and while walking. They have attempted manslaughter on my life various ways. Attacking my heart via the nervous system is one that occurred today. They flip flop between being CIA and FBI. The FBI and the Secret Service have both advised to have the bugs taken out by a specialist. I am still seeking medical attention to have that done. What I am experiencing is not freedom. I choose not to communicate with the people attacking me. Please stop these people. Thank you.</p>

            Hey I'm the original writer of the post on reddit. That letter was sent to the NSA. I didn't really want this to hit a conspiracy forum, but that it has. I am still bugged, and I am still being tortured illegally which is deemed inhumane. Wrong place wrong time. The bug wasn't meant for me, and I can't be 100% sure who it was for. The whole problem with what is going on is that they are using substances to plant electronics inside of people. That can mean different things to how long it lasts. The original one place in me is hanging out pretty stationary. They use the speaker on it sometimes. The tech itself is being misused. It's a speech assistant device and a neurostimulator. Here's a link with some more of the story. All in all... I am a hacked human being, I am a victim of modern day slavery, I am a rape victim, I am a victim of gangstalking, and I am a victim of domestic terrorism. The FBI, CIA, and NSA know about it.

            it's possible they were testing an type of rudimentary implant device.
           </p>
           <p>
            hey if so, it makes some of the 'Alien' devices look 'Nice'
           </p>
           <p>
            if this is correct they a violating his free will in an 'atomic way'
           </p>
           <p>
            good luck !
           </p>
           <p>
            it wouldn't surprise me, but on the other hand to test a device like this could easily be done without harassing someone to the point of desperation.
           </p>
           <p>
            at these late stages humans 'could' have basic devices like this but it's unlikely they woudl be used in a test like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            having said that, many people have underestimated human stupidity/cruelty in the past.

            Well this is odd. I got into Voat conversation with someone different, a few weeks ago; his message was very similar though this person has different details.
           </p>
           <p>
            There appear to be at least two people experiencing something quite similar.  My question was the same as 'jerry', below.  Why? I got no answer, and no further communication.  My private thought was that it's an unbelievable amount of energy and time spent for any organization to command, especially for someone generally to be thought of as 'ordinary'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reminds me of the old TV series,  "The Prisoner".

             Assuming this isn't fabricated its could simply be random sampling tests. Think of what we do with do with animals, we'll put a tag on them so we can track their movements and collect data.

              I dont buy it bro. Im skeptical but theres a thousand different ways to test someone like putting trackers in them without something like this getting out. Why wouldnt they just hit the guy with some tranquilizer first, take him a mile underground and then put all their sinister trackers in him and just disappear the guy entirely? Why not just pick up a bum that no one will notice is missing anyway? I think the person who wrote this is probably a paranoid schizophrenic. I only say this because i know a close family member with the same affliction but not as far gone as this guy

               I am an outspoken "conspiracy theorist" among my circle of friends and on one occasion I have had some kind of higher level attack, where words were somehow beamed to make me say nastiest things, to the people closest to me, that would have destroyed relationships. We labeled it a "panic attack", which damaged friendships anyway, but there were some parallels with this guy's story. I hope you don't have to experience it in order to appreciate others going through it.

             All the classics: bugs, implants in body, drugged, followed by cia fbi, etc.. everything from every movie ever made like this.  Guess what?  The fbi and cia don't have to bug you or follow you.  If you're hearing voices it's your brain doing it.  You know... that implant you were born with.  Poor guy.  Probably dropped too much bad acid.

                Sorry, I thought the joke I was making was more obvious than it actually was. I agree with the sentiment of the adage, and was making a sort of troll-esque meta-joke to enforce a point that I believe to be true.

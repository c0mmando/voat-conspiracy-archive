            Show them Building # 5 going down when there wasn't any reason to fall and explain what they did in that building and they start to think. Think it was building # 5. Maybe # 7. My memory gone from all the deception.

            Morons.  They live in terror of prechristian times.  NONE of this would have been possible for them without their devoted slave cults paving the way for them in the 80s.  Pre Christian times would pretty much refer to the sixties in this context.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trying to pretend this is some kind of moral conflict between the christian god and the jew is fucking hysterical to me.  JEWS CREATED THE GOD YOU WORSHIP.  YOUR OWN DOGMA VENERATES THE JEW.  YOUR GOD IS A JEW.
           </p>
           <p>
            How is that difficult to grasp?  How is this something you're going to keep supporting when the reality is staring you right in the face?  Your faith was created so the enemy could exploit it, and they did.  Now they run it all.  Christians opened the door for their masters in Washington, just handing the whole country over to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if your concern is that they're trying to get society back to prechristian times, you'd better fucking hope so.  Because if you don't you're going to find yourself lumped in with the rest of the death cultists in Germany trying to murder anyone that doesn't suck the jewish cock of their fake god.

             "Pre-Christian" times would refer to ancient Babylon, when things like child sacrifice were done out in the open, not "the sixties".
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Christ would be considered "Jewish" just like many of his Torah-observant followers, but the term "Jew" is very loaded now. Nowadays, texts like Kabbalah and Talmud are considered "Jewish" yet they condone child rape and sacrifice. They are Satanic texts that desecrate the name of Jesus (the Talmud refers to mother Mary as a harlot) yet you will find these "scriptures" being taught in synagogues around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jews who follow Torah is not what OP is referring to. Not seeing Christ as messiah is forgivable, but being "Jewish" nowadays is often far more corrupt than that. Many Jews today believe they are a special chosen master race who are permitted to treat the "Goyim" (non-Jews) like animals and that they are the only real human beings, the rest of us are just NPCs to exploit. It's all in the Talmud. The followers are extremely racist yet are usually the first to point the finger at everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bible discusses the "false jews" in detail. When people on Voat say "Jew" this is who they are referring to. AKA the "Synagogue of Satan". Do your own research. Look into the occult and find out for yourself, but you might want to adorn the full armor of God before going down that path as some unwelcome demons may enter your life.

              Accepting even the notion that all of creation was fabricated by a flying invisible jew that set the universe up as a 'gotcha' scheme is fundamentally absurd.
             </p>
             <p>
              Accepting the authority of a creature who's behavior is as petty, psychotic, tempermental, bloodthirsty and deranged as this god is even if it did exist is a fundamental betrayal of the very principles it's 'scriptures' espouse.  It was a mind control device designed to create servants for a group of death cultists.

             <p>
              It teaches that what is natural is evil, weakness is strength, and that the purpose of human life is to own people and be owned.

             <p>
              I reject that bullshit fundamentally.

               Wow, I would reject that too. Good thing He's actually looking out for us with infinite love and wisdom. When your rage subsides one day, I hope your heart leads you to investigate holy scripture deeply. Seems like you're not ready for it at the moment. If you ever do, you'll suddenly find things in the world make a lot more sense. That was my experience as a 30-year militant atheist who turned Christian.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm leaving out a lot of personal stuff that happened before God came to me but ah... nevermind.
              </p>
              <p>
               I used to believe much of the same stuff about how 'evil' God is but now I realize how propagandized I was. For instance, you could argue God is genocidal and be correct... but genocidal to whom? Are you really bothered that God would send an army to wipe out a race of fallen angel hybrids who regularly rape, murder, and torture men, women, and children? Sounds pretty awesome to me. IDK.

                false equivalency/false dichotomy.  Not going to debate your devotion to your dressed up jewish death cult, but.  It's trying to prove the existence of a negative.  One day, when your fear and need for a greater authority to tell you it's ok for you to be a human being subsides, I think your perspective will change.

                 To never know God is forgivable (you). To be shown God and turn your back is not (me). Many blessings on your path.

             I don't know how anyone doesn't understand that Christianity and Islam are BOTH Abrahamic religions - meaning the Jews are ultimately at the root of it.  Idiots, all of them.

              Exactly.  It's this bizarre absurdity with these poor people.  'Half Redpilled' I call them, capable of understanding the corruptive nature and influence of the jew in all facets of the world except their own little church.
             </p>
             <p>
              They created that church, they own that church, and they own every self enslaved drone that ascribes to an abrahamic slave dogma.  These people are ticking time bombs waiting to 'have a revelation' or 'see a vision' or 'catch a spirit'.  Then they 'feel god talking to them' and shoot a fucking school full of holes, or go murder a gay couple down the street they know nothing about, or go blow the heads off of social workers who work with poor people.
             </p>
             <p>
              All of these things happened in the last two years, and it's always the same, not just how it's reflected in media, but what it's always been.  A death cult enforcing it's perverse 
'belief system' on the human world.  Still.  Thousands of years after the Bronze Age.

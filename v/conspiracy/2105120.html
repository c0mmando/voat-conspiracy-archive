US was created by highly intelligent people. The fathers founders almost managed to create a universal perfect free and secure society.

Nobody did anything to change the archaic and useless law. It is obvious that when unemployment exist, only intellectuals are allowed to immigrate. Simple, isn\'t it?</p>
<p>This demonstrates that there are no intelligent people anymore in government. Only idiots payed by banks and corporations. If you are still optimistic and don\'t believe the Kalergi plan to be realistic, you are delusional.</p>',

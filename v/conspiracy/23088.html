            The issue for me:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              He is accused of theft, so is unarmed theft (you can call it shoplifting since it was a box of Swisher cigars*) justification for shooting?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              he is accused of pushing a police officer back into his car (he was again unarmed) - that's wrong - but is that a justification for shooting?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              it appears he tried to flee, is that a justification for shooting?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            *While I understand there is a drug culture that uses Swisher cigars as a means to envelop marijuana cigarettes, and this could be drug related - although it has not been proved or accused of being drug related so far, so to even go out on a limb and call this drug related is meaningless.
           </p>
           <p>
            Individually or collectively, none of this adds up to a need for shooting.

             The shooting issue is the first wrong in many that I see occurring. Most of the actions following it are either justified by those in control/law &amp; reaction based on psychological baiting. Now there are those in a majority are out there trying to have a peaceful stand for what has happened - this is what I can consider a logical reaction. But unfortunately, as long as you categorize all the people with a common intent (like enforcement does) then even if there is a minority of even 3 people who wish to cause mayhem, the majority pay the reprimand. What should also be considered that in any case, anyone could be hired to portray these roles that would lead to enforcement to react with certain measures they feel is just. It is unfortunate that the same degree cannot be given to the people's rights if those who enforce fail to take the moral highroad, which is sort of how this situation stemmed to be to what it currently is. With the development of how to handle these situations, it's clear that those who can influence the most change are not aiming to resolve the issue but to add fuel to the flames. This is why it is not up to the people to actually make a difference because the systems in place no longer serve for the moral interest of sustaining peace &amp; equality.

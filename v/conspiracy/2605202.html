            The Stargate is skeptical but more interestingly it was said that Sadam was busy collecting artifacts from the Sumer period. The US forces once in Baghdad swiftly took over a musuem there.

           <p>
            There is also the story that the annunaki infused their DNA with ours but many say they were lizards. This lizard story has to be wrong. Even the Bible supports claims of giants and the nephliem (however you spell that).

             The Bible is by a group who wanted to destroy serpent worship. Just look at their creation story where "the devil" is an actual snake. A group has gone through considerable effort to erase anything related to serpent worship in the "old world". The Americas still have quite a few temples and some written things relating to it. Leaves interesting questions on why it was a thing that crossed an ocean and why the serpent depicted on both sides is a constrictor type.

              Many cultures saw the serpent as a thing of wisdom. The crossing of the s repent for medical logos looks more like DNA than a constrictor.
             </p>
             <p>
              The serpent brought knowledge while god who denied them this brought carnage, jealously and strife. But the Bible claims the serpent is the devil.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is also a story that Jesus studied with a serpent sect of Buddhism.
             </p>
             <p>
              So why is the serpent bad?

                  The Summers Gilgamesh story noted the flood. Now, the question is does the Old Testament predate that of not. I am doubtful that it does.

                  History has been tampered with. The Great Library of Alexandria was torched and most historical records burned or were carted off.

                  We no longer have a heavy hand of the church regulating history as hearsay anymore so more and more is being brought forth.

                  Aliens? Maybe but I like the idea because it matches how humans evolved so quickly without other apes showing similar progress. I bet a lot has been surpressed to hide historical evidence that the Bible isn’t the definitive story.

                   I see. The flood historical account is definitely older then The Bible.

                   Alien interference makes the most sense for all records available when it comes to our existence and development. As for the reason, the Annunaki had the clearest answer: created to work (mining notably).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Our genetic structure has parts from chimpanzee and gorilla lines that is fused together in what can only be described as artificially since these 2 geneotypes do not mix. I mean it can happen but it is insanely rare and all examples of it end up dying because of the incompatibility (it deals with mismatched chromosomes). For humans to exist, not only would that mismatch have to be overcome, it would have to happen twice within a time span that allowed for a sexually mature male and a sexually mature female to be alive at the same time to make more of the new hybrid species. Good luck on that happening as an accident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Another note there: hybrid breeding tends to not be 50/50. Human DNA is nearly 50/50 on chimp+gorilla (this is not mathematically possible in a natural environment).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   One note: there were other bipedal life-forms similar to us alive with us, it's how we ended up with Neanderthal DNA, Devonian, and some other I forgot. They were in different parts of the world while humans were all over the world. The stories about this are quite clear too: we were not the first and only experiment.

                    It gets interesting the more you go down the rabbit hole doesn’t it!

                   <p>
                    Another part of the DNA tweaking is how prone we are to problems. You’d imagine that if we evolved as scientists say then Darwin would have weeded put lots of problems.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now, as you probably figured out that I’m not much into believing the good book, but the Mormons has a story that aliens lived in North America and had a Great War. Smith is a crackpot but interesting how he pull that one out his arse. Don’t forget the red hair goats of North America too.

                     Nah, but there definitely was some tampering. To call them creators means they would had to start from scratch vs. merging various species. Though honestly, the other offshoot bipeds generally fit the evolutionary path more than humans.

            I would absolutely at this point put money on their being super tech from a previous civilisation. Egyptians mention their being people before them, the “cattle kraal” made of stones with no entrances, the impossibly perfect cut stone of ancient times, the obvious cover ups by the Egyptian government over “unentered” tombs.  Too much evidence to ignore.

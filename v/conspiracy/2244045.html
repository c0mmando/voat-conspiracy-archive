So I decided to contact her. Things got weird, guys. For one, she\'s been following my extremely small, under 60 subscriber youtube channel for a couple days, longer than I\'d actually heard of her. I didn\'t realize she was one of my subscribers until she linked me to a video I had seen on one of my subscriber\'s channels. She said she found me when I liked one of her posts but none of my likes come from any of her alts. </p>
<p>Ok, personal weirdness aside, she claims she was the first or one of the first Q Anons, and that the current Q Anon is a shill or something and are feeding us false info. </p>
<p>Her story is a bit... odd. Says she\'s basically the female Seth Rich and had Trump not been elected president, she\'d probably be dead now. Also, Rosanne Barr and Taylor Swift are on our side and that a few of these high profile sexual harassment cases were faked to take down certain people who went against TPTB. Except Harvey Weinstein. He\'s the sacrificial goat. </p>

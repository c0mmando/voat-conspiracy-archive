            It would seem so! I think there's a word or phrase for a huge weapon that is just for show, to scare the enemy but can serve no real purpose in actual combat.... can't think of it right now.... but that would apply to the F1 rockets on the Saturn V and the silly cardboard lander and everything else.

            God, i hope they where not that stupid. In the pre internet era, this would have succeeded, but now we live in an era where you can not suppress knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because that inflates the value. The more you suppress the truth, the more valuable it becomes. Hence why click bait gets ignored but good articles get fuck loads of hits.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did these people not take note of what happened with the printing press? Technology always finds a way, and when it does, the peasants will get a hold of it. It just happens. It can not be stopped.
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder the alt right has grown so fast, they are the exact opposite of this way of thinking: people who read atlas shrugged and take ayan rand seriously. When you constantly tell people to get along, and that is all you sell, and all that there is on the market, the moment someone sells "be an asshole", everyone buys it, because the "supply" is low, and thus will not meet the demand.
           </p>
           <p>
            This ironically enough is how they took over mainstream culture in the 60s, only now it seems to be naturally returning to the way things where.

            He had serious doubts about the viability of a moon mission and he was obviously right, since they ended up faking them all. In fact his last recorded words can still be heard, shortly before the "accident" there were some technical issues and he can be heard asking "How are we going to get to the moon if we can't communicate between three buildings?"
           </p>
           <p>
            He was also reported to have told his wife "if there's ever a serious accident in this program it's likely to be me." He also hung a lemon on the door of the space capsule to indicate that he thought it was a piece of junk. And shortly before the Apollo 1 fire he held an impromptu meeting with the media in which he said that the program was struggling and behind schedule.
           </p>

            Both his widow and son believed he was murdered. Apparently when Bart Sibrel made his movie A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To The Moon, he got a million dollar donation from someone who worked for one of NASA's contractors. Anyway, they used $10,000 of this money to purchase a copy of the official NASA report of the fire and learned there that autopsies revealed cyanide in their bodies as well, not to mention the probable cause of the fire was a piece of metal intentionally crammed between some wiring that caused a spark.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were other mysterious Apollo deaths; since NASA is basically a division of the CIA they dispose of anyone who wanders too far off the reservation.

            So ... why? Seems to me someone ought to make a list of the scientists who were killed and a few short plausible reasons why each of them was killed. Seems a document like that might go viral.

            This goes back to the liquidation of Gus Grissom and the other Apollo 1 astronauts after Grissom had become critical of the Apollo missions and unpredictable when dealing with the media.  NASA incinerated him and 2 other astronauts in a sealed capsule filled with 100% pure oxygen, and cyanide was found in their systems as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's not to mention the other mysterious deaths associated with the Apollo era, and NASA has been faking everything from climate data to ISS footage ever since.

             Technically they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Science in the west has been destroyed by corporatism and socialism. It used to be, a company would work very hard, discover something, then patent that discovery and make money.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the socialists showed up, and started claiming that science belonged to everyone. This hurt the incentive to discover things.
            </p>
            <p>
             It did create the incentive to lie. Communists would lie to puff up their bullshit system, like what they do in china and what the genders studies is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Corporations now lie, because they can make more money selling those lies than they can working.
            </p>
            <p>
             This behavior over the last 50 years is about to hit critical mass. Once all these secrets come out, there will be a depression as a large number of the "too big to fails" implode. Then, as the prices hit rock bottom, people will start buying the remnants of these companies, and things will return to the way that they where before progressives where in business.

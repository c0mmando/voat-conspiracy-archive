            (ORIGINAL COHERENT TEXT) Simon Astaire: hoax master - - Bestselling author of Mr. Coles and Private Privelige (suspiciously centered around lonely tortured school boys). Also a famous talent agent and mentor for young actors (Rachel Weiss, Sebastian De Souza etc.). He wrote the screenplay for the upcoming film adaptation of Mr. Coles as well as the new biography of british soccer star Sol Campbell. A frequent news pundit for american news stations and the Royal British family, he splits time between London and LA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simon Astaire took the recent picture of his close friend Peter Rodger (director of hunger games/father of mass murderer elliot rodger) with the father of shooting victim Christopher Martinez (aka angry NRA actor dad). Simon Astaire has also spoke to multiple news channels on behalf of the parents of Elliot Rodger, retelling the entire manufactured story from the perspective of the parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Multiple witnesses said there were 2 men in that BMW in Isla Vista. Pictures of deli workers cleaning up a bloody crime scene themselves with paper towels are equally suspicious (where are the crime scene processors?).
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't mean any disrespect to the victims or families of this tragedy, but there are too many coincidences surrounding this Simon Astaire. I believe that Simon Astaire is the author of the elliot rodger manifesto and is the man who directed the real life "screenplay" of the Santa Barbara tragedy. I believe Simon Astaire was coaching Elliot Rodger on how to act for his real life film role of "homicidal lonely monster". I believe Simon Astaire was present during the making of all the infamous youtube videos, likely writing every line of dialogue. Simon Astaire lies each and every time he steps in front of a news camera and is essentially getting away with murder without any suspicion from the public whatsoever. Please take a deeper look into the contradictions of the official story.

A short answer that would be closest to the truth is Balkanization, which means reshaping borders by war without voting and democratic process. Balkanization is used to continue the destruction of the middle east and Africa so we can balkanize them to bring about a borders that work for the New World Order. If people wonder why America has made incredible advances in medicine and technology but the American people are financially decimated then look no further than something called Agenda 2030! This UNITED NATION\'S wealth redistribution project is the second part of Agenda 21 which has taken action and is under way right now. Agenda 21 was the guilt trip project of getting hundreds of nations to agree to get on the &quot;climate change agenda&quot; then brilliantly changed over to the Agenda 2030 project we see today. The Agenda 2030 agreement is signed by over 170 countries including the USA. The Agenda 2030 project clearly lays out a 17 point plan to reshape the world by the year 2030. Just a few of its goals are paraphrased as follows, ending wide spread acute poverty completely, ensuring equality to all genders, reconstructing nation\'s cities and habitable land (national parks) to be in sync and on par with the protocols of sustainable development ... see Agenda 21 for explanation of &quot;sustainable development.&quot; The point of all this is to use technology and indoctrination of populations to get them conditioned to relinquish their own as well as their nations sovereignty to the United Nations as to propel the world into a progressive future of sustainable development to the benefit of all! I implore EVERYONE to take a look at the Agenda 2030 plan if you think I am exaggerating or embellishing the plan\'s goals or integrity. I also have one more request, if it is such a glorious plan that benefits all (as it states itself) and needs EVERYONE on board and cooperating not just their nations but the people of those nations themselves, then why have we heard NOTHING ABOUT THIS FROM OUR POLITICIANS AND PRESS??? Oh but there was a big hype about the whole plan back a couple years ago when the Pope visited America for the first time in decades to address the UNITED NATIONS council in New York to get everyone to sign the plan as it is for the good of humanity ..... meanwhile this was happening all the press coverage was not about the details of the plan but rather whatever stupid publicity stunt the Pope was doing that day! Anyone can feel free to contact me about this as I can never get tired of talking about it! Agenda 2030 is a recipe for global socialism in less than 15 years and we have not ONE socialist country to point too that has successfully implemented similar policies on a national level let alone a global one! Please I beg people to prove me wrong as this terrifies me that 1) NO ONE IS DISCUSSING THIS AND 2) THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS WILL WORK AND WORK SMOOTHLY ... Sincerely take care and be easy ...

            Equality by increasing poverty. If everyone is poor then poverty doesn't exist. Cashless. Universal Basic Income. Those are what to look out for. It is still unclear as to how putting Muslims in Europe and allowing Islam to develop any further helps the Agenda. Them of all people will outright reject everything globalists want. I'm 99% sure the refugees are walking off a cliff coming to Europe. They will get lynched by leftists and right wingers in future. All this covering up and censorship of those rejecting the Islamisation is happening because it's too premature yet necessary. Soon everyone will be saying "Fuck Islam!" That will then send us into World War 3 by 2020. They are giving us no choice but to go to war with Islam. Iran is going to get the worst of it. Indiscriminate destruction. Then after the war the globalisation will be in full swing to take advantage of the economy. There's no other way they can achieve 1 currency without a major conflict with the countries who oppose it. The only people who will peacefully comply with it are Europe. Australia, China, Japan, America, Saudi Arabia etc. etc. A lot of middle easterners won't so it's pretty much going to be Fallout for them. Parts of Africa is a shit hole that globalists would rather eradicate than try heal. Africans in white countries are like what Pandas are to a zoo. They're being conserved. Anyway this is my twisted take on it all. It's all that makes sense to me if I was to be a globalist. But hey what can we do...

             Shills- I agree with you completely. They will prob use Islam to initiate WW3. Although it is quite strange how people who claim that the Albert Pike letter from back in the day was dubbed a fake and forgery yet it still is coming to fruition. It contained a brief layout of the future to come, first by stating there would be 3 world wars to bring about a global government. The first world war would be used to start the removal of the monarch families of Europe, the second war would create a Jewish state and the third world war would be between Islam and Judaism and would culminate in the creation of the New World Order .... even if it is a fake like some claim it is still very strange that those events have and appear to be happening. But like you said "hey what can we do ..." just be prepared as best as one can be I guess, half the battle is just having some sense of what the hell is happening which most people are completely oblivious so clearly you and I have a head start lol! Take care my friend and be easy!

             I appreciate your response thank you sir! I do not use their doublespeak personally as I reject it. However I merely used the term "all genders" because that was the terminology used in the Agenda 2030 plan. As for the Jewish Question it is something that I discuss at length with people and def believe it needs to be discussed more as well. I will do research into the "Oded Yinon Plan" and if there is anything else you wish to share, I am all ears. Sincerely, take care and be easy!

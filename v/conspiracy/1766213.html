If so what what already? I will show here- By drawing dot by dot and over lines I show there may be white dots but that these images are more about human tissue and body parts and fantasy realms with kings and horses and architural shapes as in houses more than a natural picture of space. Is this a conspiracy worthy post? I think so because everybody wonders what is nasa up to? People wonder Did we really go to the moon or was that just a video. Now i ask nasa why the fake pictures of Stars? In this article NASA do admit to these hubble images having &quot;overlying&quot; older images from over time at Hubble. But actually what they are doing is a style of photography pioneered (secretly) by Maxfield Parish where layers on layers of photographic imagery is placed strategically over each to hide other images in plain sight. The scale of the hidden images will be 50% tinier say than the front image, then another scale of 75% and the whole surface will be covered with yet another image, and then on a scale of 15% just for example, for yet another whole new surface of dynamic action layered apon what\'s already been layered. Then Maxfield called  it a &quot;painting&quot;. That\'s how it works. The rule in finding these hidden images and countering measurent scales imagery, is that in nature no three lines appear together. So when there are three equal lines there is a problem. That\'s where I start to draw. There is a story to tell in every hubble image and the first story in these images has crucifiction, a human form holding the beheaded head of a king. Btw, that was fucking clever of them! the way they hid that, and i would never have found (seen) the kings broken crown without using the rule about three equal lines do not make a natural picture. It was only as I followed along the lines that i drew out (just a little) some imagery that is so obviously handiwork of man. </p>
<p>These images are from the first pages of the article so I show the before I drew on it and after I drew on it, so you know my source is the magazine itself. No need for higher resolution it\'s pretty clear. Just use your eyes, even with out my drawing.

<p>This centerfold is into the article a couple pages. Think - medical industry photographic images of blood,eyeballs,lips, fleshless tissue and you will see that. Also there is a story to tell in these pictures. I don\'t know what that\'s about, I haven\'t studied the story. But I know FAKE imagery, these are just a couple examples, it takes me a few hours to draw stuff out and I don\'t wanna distract my energies from another project right now so I leave you guys with this, hope to hear what you have to say about this. Is it mind control? What conspiracy does this fall into anyway, flat earth? Not sure why space pictures need to be fake now too. </p>

             thank you i needed to hear that. Right now. It just got deleted by thought police Tallest_Skil and downvoted too by him i think. Thanks for noticing it before it got deleted. Totally not into wasting anyone's time here.  The only space I somewhat respect lately so its hard. I have alot skills at this type of work and wanna pour over the Pizzagate shit and shut it down. I saw this and it's just too important. In the struggle with Pizzagate imagery the same type of just bombardment but the nasa agenda is, I thought  perfect conversation for the conspiracy forum. Oh well i will post it to gab where i have an account. I wanna get back to the other stuff. Now that I learned how to post to vaot I will keep trying. I have a lot to show, and I have skill I can teach, about how to look, how to see. Trust your self is rule one. Trust your own eyes. Thanks again. Stay tuned im not giving up.

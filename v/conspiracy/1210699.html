  'formattedContent' => '<p>Hillary will get elected. She rigged the DNC, she\'s going to rig the whole election. They gave it to Obama in 2008, now it\'s her turn. </p>
<p>As I\'ve said from the beginning, Trump is there to scare people in to voting for Hillary. He\'s a scapegoat bad guy, but he attracts lots of people through racism and xenophobia, which ties in to how scared people are about the economy and their desire to fix it. Trump will keep getting crazier, and the media will make him look like an insane person to ensure Hillary wins. But it will be a squeaker, of course 51%/49%, to give the illusion that people <em>almost had it</em>. They just need to try a little harder next time and their voices will be heard. This is a lie. Both options are rigged, they both lead to the same place, that is control by the military-industrial complex and the biggest international banks. Same as we had under Obama, same as we had under Bush. Same as we\'ve had since probably every president after JFK.</p>
<p>They run the show. It\'s a big club, and we\'re not in it. We are not in the club. </p>
<p>They are trying to engineer a very profitable war. It is very profitable to blow up billions of dollars of equipment, because then you have to build it all again, but it seems like for a purpose, so money keeps getting borrowed from the banks and put in to the pipelines of the manufacturing of arms, missiles, planes, tanks, etc. </p>
<p>People don\'t like wars, you have to convince them a war is necessary. In this bad economy, it doesn\'t take much. People are looking for scapegoats to explain why they can\'t make it. War makes economies prosper. </p>
<p>But this economy does have one prominent metric that appears to be prospering, the stock market. So if that were to go away, then everyone would pretty much be ready for a war to stimulate the economy. (As happened in/after WW2 and other wars, as the US grows its empire and takes over more land and governments and banks and so on.)</p>
<p>The previous stock crash, just under 8 years ago, happened right after Obama started. So some people blamed it on Obama, some blamed it on Bush. This diffuses the blame, adds confusion, and keeps people arguing about their side vs the other side, instead of looking in to who is actually screwing them. </p>
<p>So I think the stock market crash will be in close proximity to the election, probably right after it, unless they lose control early because this thing is ready to pop. </p>
<p>The stock market crash will upset lots of people, who will want it fixed. They will be told that the way to fix it, is to bomb Syria. They will do this through some alchemy of emotions, through the media. By a terrorist attack <em>causing</em> the market crash, that is then blamed on ISIS, or by the market crashing more naturally and then blaming it on systemic issues like immigration of people from Syria. Like there\'s so many Syrian refugees that are causing problems we <em>have</em> to go over there and fix this civil war! (that we\'re funding and arming the rebels to create in the first place, but they won\'t say that part) Or a third option is that Russian/Syrian/ISIS hackers caused the market to crash. Any of those would take the outrage of the market crashing, and focus it on a war with Syria. </p>
<p>With the crash blamed mostly on Obama, and the market crashing, Hillary guides us to war, to try and save the day (and everyone\'s retirement accounts). Meanwhile the military-industrial complex gets a fat paycheck, the bankers get access to a new market (the Syrian government currently prints it\'s own money instead of borrowing through debt from a central bank) and America conquers another country. America profits from the rebuilding as they install the  new government through supposedly democratic elections (see trump vs hillary) and the stock market booms once again, showing the economic value of war, which is a lesson the MIC wants the public to learn. It wants war and economic prosperity to be associated, so that the people are always begging for it. </p>
<p>Then Hillary gets re-elected in 2020 by a 51/49 margin against some crackpot republican plant (unless some charismatic figurehead arrives) and the war in Syria continues over the full 8 years, just like the Iraq war. This puts them closer to cracking the Iran nut, and overthrowing that government again as they did in 1953, before it was taken back by Iran/Russia in 1979.  
</p>
<p>At some point, America is going to start to fall apart, and this Syria war is their last effort to save the Empire and drag this out a little longer. The Chinese are already poking holes in our defense in the Pacific. We are collapsing domestically and that will soon be reflected abroad. If the Russians and Chinese fully cooperated, they could begin to end the US world hegemony and they know it. </p>
<p>This isn\'t even touching on the issue of what\'s going to happen as the US dollar loses its status as a reserve currency. Countries are beginning to shun holding the US dollar, and are trying to get out of using it to trade oil (See: Libya, Syria, Russia, Iran) which upsets the US greatly because it could break the foundation of the currency. If suddenly the world is flooded with trillions of USD, the value of one USD will go down a lot, which is also known as inflation. China and Russia know this, and they\'ve already begun to dump, but not before the US financiers set up banks in Belgium to buy up the excess liquidity. This game cannot be continued forever. The loss of the reliability of a currency is much more serious than a stock market crash, it may happen once every 80 years instead of once every 8. But this seems to be the situation, as between the petrodollar and reserve currencies, there doesn\'t seem to be any more mechanisms to soak up excess printed dollars. Those are quickly coming to an end, which means the market will become flooded with USD, and it will become worthless. They\'ve managed to figure out strategies to kick the can down the road, but the situation is quickly becoming untenable as other countries lose faith in the US government and the USD.  
</p>
<p>The stock market is at all-time highs even though the economy itself has been stagnant since the 2008 crash. This is largely because of corporate buybacks, where corporations borrow money to buy their own stock to keep the price up. This practice has exploded in popularity the last few years. At some point, the banks will not lend them anymore, and the buybacks will stop, and the market will crash. </p>
<p>So roughly, I see the timeline as Trump goes nuts -&gt; Hillary wins -&gt; Terrorist attack/Stock market crashes -&gt; War in Syria -&gt; Hillary re-election -&gt; War in Syria</p>',

            Any violent revolution would put the American public in that martial law position you pointed out because then the public as well as the government will feel "justified" taking measures to stop the riots by any means necessary. This is also the value of the agent provocateur from the perspective of the police, to create violence where there was none, to give police the excuse to be able to come in and crack down using their practiced methods, where they know they have an upper hand.. Violence begets violence, and the state is better at violence than any of us will ever be.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have contingency plans for any violent revolution, and it would probably work out in their favor. The US government (mostly the CIA) has overseen the overthrow of 53 international governments since WW2 ended. Most of them violent. There's no doubt they could handle an overthrow here. Any revolution, especially if it's violent, will have its momentum captured by people who are experienced in using the media to guide revolutions to create outcomes that benefit the CIA. They've been doing it for 60 years at the least, they're really good at it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why non-violent revolution is the only way to go, because they don't have good plans for that. If everyone starts shooting and there's a civil war, then you can bet they will be playing both sides, and playing them well. However, if 300 million people simply go stand in DC and clog up the streets until we have a new constitution and a new government, it would happen and the momentum would be much harder for the CIA to capture because it would be a movement by the people and there would be much less confusion and distractions as compared to a violent one. We just need to change the government, we don't need to destroy it all forever.
           </p>
           <p>
            If possible, I would prefer doing like the UK and many other European countries did with their kings and queens, let them live in a castle and have a fancy title, but take away all their actual power and let the people direct the government. If we could pull off a modern-day version of this with the Bush and Clinton lineages, I think that'd be terrific.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or Americans could do an 2009 iceland-style pots and pans revolution, where people literally bring their pots and pans and bang them very loudly as they clog the streets for days and weeks, bringing the operations of various organizations to a standstill.
           </p>
           <p>
            These avenues are very preferable to banana-republic tactics, which the CIA perfected, because they were the ones who did them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Non-violent protest is the ultimate tactic if everyone participates. Even if just 10% participated, we could start fresh without spilling blood, and without the MIC taking the reigns again.

             No idea about India really, but I wouldn't be surprised to see them take the same side as the British since their trade and economy is so dependent on the West.

              Exactly a war where Europe russia, china and usa smash each other, makes india sole economic superpower in the post war years.

               That's an interesting theory, but I doubt india is orchestrating all this war activity. They might be lucky to benefit from it though

            That's both well thought out, and fucking scary.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all the Clinton Cash info coming out and the whole "Game of Thrones" being unveiled (Don't get me wrong, I've been pretty wise to the level of fuckery since Ron Paul's first attempt at the presidency, but it gets clearer every day), I really doubt the oligarchs would allow any actual threat to their power.  People die all the time, and everyone's got something that can be leveraged against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who might actually threaten the status quo would be offed, or threatened into silence. (See Kennedy or Bernie Sanders).

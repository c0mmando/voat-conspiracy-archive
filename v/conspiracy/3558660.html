            Totally had this same thought awhile ago. Also look at Peter Pan, stealing children and the immortality of the pirates. As well as Pinocchio, pleasure island and the robbing of innocence and turning children into donkeys to be shipped off in crates.

            There's a side to Hollywood few actually tend to notice.
           </p>
           <p>
            For instance: there was once a film name The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. What a curious film, indeed...

             On people noticing the propagandized elements of our movies - how much of that do you think goes unnoticed?   Or the opposite, how much of it goes completely unnoticed and entirely absorbed?   Its kind of fascinating to think that our most widely share culture is loaded with this stuff.   Somewhere out in space there is a planet that broadcasts its most heinous crimes to one another and people pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last summer, Thanos was clearly telling us he's going to destroy the world and Scarlet's character makes sure to remind us again that he meant what he said after the long grim scene of endless cuts of everyone fading away.   Yes, its part of the plot, but it is messaging in the most direct way and I don't think that it goes over everybody's head on how they feel - bored and miserable.   The generation of parents that are taking their ten year olds to the theater to see this watch how far the industry has slipped since they were a kid.   In my childhood, we had Ferris Bueller, Goonies, and many others that were uplifting and humorous and that was the standard for commercial viability.   The most hyped film of last year was a three hour apocalyptic mellowdrama for young children.   Is it market driven or is this the generation you want to indoctrinate first with this kind demoralizing drudge of a movie?
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Imaginarium, suppose a film like that was something more than meets the eye, it would be what storytelling is intended for - making something meaningful.   People should not find it difficult to believe that our mass media could be used by interests for all types of purposes - serving as a toy commercials or telling the tales of our time.   Maybe big plans have been drawn out of the public view and that's how these films are inspired, or maybe by the personalities or personal stories behind the scenes.  But what do you see into it exactly?

              As for the film I mentioned, it's about as close to the truth as you're going to see come from Hollywood. There's a reason a man had to die for it to reach out eyes and ears.

             And fun post OP! Fuck these haters. I haven't seen monsters inc in a while, but the one eye symbol is all over it (obviously).

            <p>
             I think the film could be interpreted a little more broadly, to a transition of using love as the primary currency rather than fear. A lot of people refer to this as the age of Aquarius. The bible referring to 1000 years of peace in revelations also sounds similar.
            </p>
            <p>
             Old media is falling apart, and as more people wake up to the fear based programming, and the potential evils of materialism and consumerism, we'll demand change from ourselves and our leaders. Hopefully :)

              The Eye of Horus is largely misunderstood.
             </p>
             <p>
              Horus having his eye symbolizes humanity being able to see. We can no longer see, thus they mock us for being blind. Yes, them covering their eye is them mocking us for being stupid.

             sure it might have been a larp, but why the hell would shills show up at a larp thread? you always have some sperg going on an on about "muy trooth!111" but all shilling does is make the thread look more important.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it was a larp, then it was the luckiest larper ever, and the work of Egyptian frog gods.

               a person asks a whole bunch of questions, distracts crazy Internet people, and you never stop to ask why?
              </p>
              <p>
               If it is just larping autism, then sure that was a good laugh, look at how stupid the spergs are, hence why they can't hold real jobs and are on 4chan all day.
              </p>
              <p>
               Except what draws my attention is how people get upset when you dig into the questions asked. Sure some of them were stupid, but a few others were not. The moment people start looking into things, is the moment people scream LARP!!!, and demand everyone get back to looking at japanese porn cartoons or whatever it is that they do on the chans.

                Nothing posted by a kike shill is going to be a valid question. Any question they ask is hiding something from a real question. Rather than waste time spelling out public knowledge, ask yourself what questions he DIDNâ€™T ask.

                Oh, and the LARPers (it wasnâ€™t just one person) said nothing about Jews and admitted to being civic nationalists.

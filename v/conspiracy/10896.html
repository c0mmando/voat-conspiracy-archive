<p>I have had some thoughts as of late I wish to express to this sub. I\'m happy to see that we still stayed together and found a new spot to freely express our thoughts and feelings on matters that are considered to most people taboo. But I would like to point some things out if people are not aware. </p>
<p>After the latest Reddit blunder with the upvote/downvote change, it seems that most traffic came from <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> after that change. I tried posting about Whoaverse in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/redditalternatives">r/redditalternatives</a> but with not much luck in garnishing excitement or new users (probably very little). It seemed when searching for all things Whoaverse within Reddit, most if not all posts came from the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> sub and nowhere else. I thought to myself, &quot;why just <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> and not in any other sub like <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/programming">r/programming</a> or another major sub that would embrace an alt to Reddit to help build and grow.&quot; Did we not share Whoaverse anywhere outside of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a>? Who was the first person to realize Whoaverse was the next step logical step anyway? I\'ve seen talks of other people trying to set up alternatives as well (some still in progress and not live). </p>
<p>The way I see things from an outside perspective of both Reddit and Whoaverse, it seems most of the senior <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> members (mods as well) came flocking here. I assume this could be a divide and conquer tactic of some kind to isolate the more higher level members of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> into a zone where it would be more easily controlled. This is where they(shills,trolls, JTRIG) could make Whoaverse seem like a just a circle jerk of conspiritard and conspiracy users just fighting it out in here to Reddit. This can stop more people from migrating and be turned off by this alternative(these aren\'t our true problems though). This site is in very early stages of development and will be subject to many different attacks and manipulation (as we\'ve seen already with bots and such). There has been great strides in bringing us together and the most important point is to keep it that way and future proof this united group from all sorts of attacks that split us up. </p>
<p>One of my ideas is this; Could we create some sort of extra channel or transparent message board/meeting area outside of Whoaverse (I\'m not advocating abandoning this site). We could keep track of where this group could migrate next and/or where our influence extends to inform other members that lost track of where to go for this type of information? Right now Whoaverse is an alternative to Reddit, but in the micro scale of things <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> has essentially gone to shit with the new changes and Whoaverse has become our only grounds to communicate. So I ask for a discussion and propose a solution.  With this messageboard/pastebin/meeting place we can post what sites we have migrated to and basically send this to all aggregates that pop up down the road. I feel this would be better to keep more people together with the possible upcoming emergence of many different Reddit alternatives coming down the road. I apologize for not providing any explicit examples to use but that is where the discussion part can come into play. This &quot;space&quot; could be managed by someone we all know and trust  or we look for some type of open source route ( I prefer this as to keep things transparent and to thwart any type of corruption). This should ensure that our community can safely hop and skip around different aggregates that fall prey to a huge honey pot trap or subject to abusive moderation/admins. With this new &quot;place&quot; we can attach/link it to all aggregate sidebars for people to see, this way <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">r/con</a> &amp; <a href="https://preview.voat.co/v/con">v/con</a> and any other community that sprouts up from this Reddit divide and can find each-other. This isn\'t really a way to combat or keep trolls away, but more of a solution to keep the community grounded and united.</p>
<p>I think Atko is doing a great job and feel like we need to get more programmers on board to get things moving faster. In the early stages of Reddit, most of the postings, traffic and users were primarily relating to porn, programming and science. If we create a free and open space with intelligent individuals we will most certainty create a valuable site.  I have already engaged interest into helping this site grow and encourage others to spread the word and do the same. My personal next step is to help create a new UI and layout that distinguishes itself from Reddit entirely. So what do you all think?</p>',

            No no. Sorry for making this difficult, I was trying to express a way in which all users of
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/con">
             r/con
            </a>
            ,v/con, hubski.com etc.  to attach their identities to some type of universal leaderboard/board list (and by identity, just their user_id) . It could just be a link visible on the sidebar that allows any user from any aggregate to sign up for it and to fill in their own usernames that they affiliate with on different types of 'reddits'. It could display things like universal history of upvote/downvote score, where they are currently subbed and so forth. (Just an idea I'm throwing out there, I wanted to see more engagement and ideas from you guys to even think this is a worthy idea or not). Does that make more sense?

             Agreed, the potential is ripe here. My concern is maintaining the unity of this growth wherever it may end up going in the future. Whoaverse will not be the only one eventually and I feel that hedging our bets with using an outside assisted tool to direct where this group goes would be the key to keeping everyone together and surviving any malicious attempts at breaking us up.

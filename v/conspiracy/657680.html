These students then inevitably become attached to this system that rewards them, so it effectively makes all the most intelligent students very pro-authority, pro-&quot;the system&quot;, because the system has always worked well for them. Then they are comfortable joining the military, working for the government, or working for large companies.

Especially if you trick them in to taking out a bunch of debt, then they\'re trapped forever. They don\'t see legitimate ways to act to improve their situation on a long-term basis, and so all this pent-up energy gets put in to trivial spectacles like sports.

<p>Anyway, all these causes bleed in to the same effect: Anti-intellectualism. America hates people who are smart. People who ask too many questions suck. People who have &quot;moral issues&quot; with things are losers. Etc, etc. These are the ideas of a person who was wrung through the ringer of the school system and the media and the society we live in. These all feed anti-intellectualism, which serves to maintain the status quo. If smart people are never listened to (in terms of social organizing and things like this), then difficult problems will take much longer to fix. This serves the interests of the people already in power. </p>
<p>Anyway, some food for thought on a Friday evening. Curious if anyone else has anything to add.</p>',

            I've never understood how these supposedly high-IQ people in academia thought it was a good idea to be the university's bitch for 12 years to get a degree that only gets them a moderately high-paying and moderately prestigious job, when if they'd just put the same amount of time and mental effort into a business, they could be filthy rich by the same point.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, compare Donald Trump and Stephen Hawking, and I think what I'm saying becomes pretty obvious. Both high IQ, around the same age, and we'll say they put roughly the same amount of effort into their work, but one has a few million dollars from book sales and some influence over the sci-fi nerds who buy them, and the other has billions of dollars from actual contributions to society, and influence over pretty much everyone.

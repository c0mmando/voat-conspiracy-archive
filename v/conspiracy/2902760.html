<p>I was in person with a friend today, and they had some friends in town from Cuba we we\'re going to meet them and have dinner together. On the way to dinner I discussed with my friend an article I had read about how Fidel Castro\'s son left a suicide note claiming that Justin Trudeau is his half brother and Fidel Castro\'s son.</p>
<p>I showed her the article, and she asked that I send it to her so she could forward it to her friends.</p>
<p>I used Facebook messenger to send it to her as an SMS. 
(We were together at the time)
I assumed she would get it and we went on with our dinner with her friends from Cuba.
She kept asking me why I didn\'t send it and I kept saying I did. She didn\'t get the link, ut she did get other unrelated pictures I had sent in the meantime just not the link... So I again sent the link... Again using messenger to send the SMS.
still she didn\'t get the second message. So I then used messenger to send it to her Facebook rather than SMS. And it gave me an error saying I could not send the message. And acted like the user had blocked me from sending messages. Which being with her at the time I  knew wasn\'t so.. However if I just said hi.. with no link it would go through. So that made it clear that Facebook was blocking the link. EVEN SILENTLY BLOCKING it on SMS, Which Facebook shouldn\'t even be able to do if you ask me.</p>
<p>Then the same link I tried as a Facebook comment, and post and both are blocked as well.</p>

<p>I find it very disturbing that Facebook can decide which SMS messages to send and even do so silently without telling you the message was blocked. So it would appear that all of your sms messages are ran across Facebook servers to check if they think it\'s something they approve of you sending before it will send the text message. And all I can say is WHAT THE FUCK FACEBOOK?? Needless to say I set a different app as my sms app, and blocked messenger from permissions to SMS. </p>
<p>I know Facebook is bullshit so spare me the lecture, I have friends that only use messenger for one reason or another so deleting it isn\'t an option, but I was using the SMS functionality as a convienience so I could have just one app do both. But those days are over with this revelation that apparently Facebook is monitoring SMS messages and even silently blocking them. I wouldn\'t have known she didn\'t get my message if I hadn\'t been with her at the time ..</p>',

            Common in chat apps allowed who want to do business in strict countries. If the other party is in a country requiring censorship the company owning the app with either comply or you won't be using the app to communicate with your buddy in that country... or he'll have to take the risk of using a VPN (typically really easy to track him down on). Chinese chat apps do it, so not terribly surprised that FB does it either (gotta Zuck the world).

            On a related note google sms was sending a

             different link entirely
            </em>
            than one i sent to a friend. Its only going to get worse when they migrate off standard SMS to IP based sms messenging

              Yes google messages... The newer versions route to sms over ip instead of old school sms. Uninstalled the updates and went back to stock before it supported sms over ip.
             </p>
             <p>
              Im sure there is a freeware version on fdroid if you look. Which reminds me i should do that myself .

               So what you're saying is I should disacxoiate with my mother, my sister, all my friends and my lady as well. Dude like 85 percent of the population uses Facebook these days. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but you're simply not being realistic.

                 I just want to know where you meet these people that aren't on facebook. And what do you do open the conversation with them asking if they are on Facebook? I live in a metropolitan area, one of the biggest in the nation, and literally everyone from 13 to 65 with extremely rare exception are on there. Actually I can't off the top of my head think of a single person that isn't. So like I said I would be pretty lonely if I took that stance. It would be me and my dog and that's it. Not because of decisions I made, but because of decisions that quite literally every single person has made. That would be like saying don't be friends with people that have a left pinky toe. Basically everyone does and the ones that don't you wouldn't know because they're wearing shoes......

            This is probably a part of Facebook's effort to stop the spread of what it deems to be "fake news", which is wrong, obviously.

           <p>
            The specific article you've tried to share is, most likely, "fake news" -- or, disinformation, more accurately. Baxter Dmitri of YourNewsWire (now rebranded as NewsPunch because people started correlating YourNewsWire with disinformation) is the

            Baxter Dmitry takes solid information about legit conspiracies, then adds-in his own fabricated-sensationalist-disinformation to the mix for clicks, making anyone who shares his disinformation look terrible in the process. That may actually be the whole point. He could easily be part of

             Also who the double fuck are they to be reading my SMS messages, and then blocking them without even informing me they did.

              I agree, FB shouldn't be making these decisions for us. They've buckled to Deep State pressure after Pizzagate created "fake news" hysteria.

               Oh well, yeah I know that guy spreads disinformation...
              </p>
              <p>
               BUT
              </p>
              <p>
               I still have a right to share the article with friends OVER SMS NO LESS. and the pictures in the article speak for themselves. There may be some disinformation in there who knows. But the article was in English and the people who I was trying to get it to we're from Cuba and don't even speak English they speak Spanish.. so they couldn't have even read the disinformation anyways. It was really just to share the pictures with them.
              </p>
              <p>
               But all of that is completely besides the point. If Facebook wants to block posts on their platform, I feel that's bullshit.. but okay.
              </p>
              <p>
               But them blocking SMS text messages sent from my phone number to another phone number silently as well...
That's taking it too far.
              </p>
              <p>
               Heck I thought you use messenger to send a text it just went out your phone, but apparently they send the text to their servers to make sure they approve. And if they don't approve they just don't send the text.
              </p>
              <p>
               At least when you try to post something they block they tell you it didn't post, and when a messenger message to another Facebook account t is blocked they tell you it's blocked.
              </p>
              <p>
               When they block a sms message, they say nothing they just don't send the message.
              </p>
              <p>
               Stay the fuck out of my SMS messages Facebook..
              </p>
              <p>
               So yeah I uninstalled messenger on one of my phones and on the other one I disabled it's access to SMS, and installed an alternative.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm pretty sure they don't mention anywhere in any user agreements that they can and do block sms texts based on their fake news algorithm...

            This isn't surprising. They DO monitor messages, that I know for a fact. I work as a dispatcher for a local 911 center. We received a call from one of the Facebook offices saying that they had picked up suicide threats in a person's messages and wanted officers to go check on them. They even had their registered address and where they had logged on last. I very rarely use messenger on Facebook anyways, but this definitely made me question what else they monitor.

              They most likely have a list of "fake news" websites that are auto-blocked.

              It may also be some sort of spam filter.

             <p>
              You should try testing with some other websites, both MSM and alternative media.

               Well yeah they aren't going to filter CNN. And they already announced their strategy on this and have been doing it admittedly on Facebook posts. But they never admitted to doing it on messages, and especially not on SMS Messages.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is the fake news/spam filter that they use for Facebook posts... But being used on sms messages as well.
              </p>

               But I can tell you I added spaces to the URL to make it not a valid url and they still blocked it so that didn't circumvent the block.

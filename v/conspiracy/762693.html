<p><strong>Hillary</strong></p>
<p>Hillary has been a long-time supporter of the idea that Jerusalem is Israel\'s. In 1999 she wrote in a letter <a href="http://jpupdates.com/2015/07/08/hillary-clinton-was-first-to-support-moving-u-s-embassy-to-jerusalem-but-does-she-support-it-now/">â€œIf I am chosen by New Yorkers to be their senator, or in whatever position I find myself in the years to come, you can be sure that I will be an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.â€</a></p>

<p><strong>Sanders</strong></p>
<p>In response to being asked if he is a Zionist by a Vox interviewer:</p>
<p>â€œA Zionist? What does that mean? Want to define what the word is? Do I think Israel has the right to exist? Yeah, I do. Do I believe that the United States should be playing an even-handed role in terms of its dealings with the Palestinian community in Israel? Absolutely I do.â€œ</p>

My long-term hope is that instead of pouring so much military aid into Israel, into Egypt, we can provide more economic aid to help improve the standard of living of the people in that area.â€</a></p>
<p><strong>Jeb</strong></p>
<p>Just like Hillary, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/30/politics/jeb-bush-u-s-embassy-location-israel/">Jeb wants to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.655896">Zionists want another term of the last Bush, but they\'ll settle for Jeb, who would\'ve also authorized the Iraq invasion.</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So all the candidates do things for Israel and more importantly the Zionist billionaires who are pulling the strings of many governments. If they do not toe the line, they are systematically excluded from the media, like Ron Paul was. The more they oppose Zionist ideas, the more actively they\'re cut out of the media landscape, and the more they promote them the more they\'re placed in the center of attention. </p>
<p>Check out this video, giving good examples of even more candidates like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul with video clips of statements showing their support of Zionist ideals because they need the financial and media support from Zionists in order to succeed in our governmental system as it exists. <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x31tczh">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x31tczh</a></p>',

            He knows all to well you can not name the jew and hope to win. He's already pushing the jew enough. He doesn't support Israel. He says he does but it's fucking obvious in his actions and beliefs that he is the opposite of Israel. He's playing like the controlled double agent controlled opposition. The opposition is to them though.

           The TV is the biggest source of direct power. I often think about how the TV can present a twist in the road and totally change the narrative. It rarely happens, but it always can.
          </p>
          <p>
           So here's one.
          </p>
          <p>
           One day all of the big networks open up their news with the story:
          </p>
          <p>
           Hillary Clinton is in trouble after such-and-such person recommended that she should be charged with a crime for x-activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Go to film clip of Hillary doing x-activity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Pressure is mounting for her to step down as a candidate as the circle of those who think she should be prosecuted grows.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's hear from our legal expert:
          </p>
          <p>
           What Hillary did would normally require criminal charges, and many experts I've spoken with think she should be charged now too ....
          </p>
          <p>
           And so it goes. A script. Presented by all four networks on the same night. All the CEOs know each other and they know each other well.
          </p>
          <p>
           The rest of the media knows to echo.
          </p>
          <p>
           Or, it could all happen to Donald Trump.
          </p>
          <p>
           Can you imagine this?
          </p>
          <p>
           No, I don't think this will happen, but it is an illustration of just how powerful the TV still is. What the TV wants, 99 percent of the time, the TV gets.

            I think the biggest question is, are there people out there worth working for?
           </p>
           <p>
            I've spent years in the working world and there are some people who seem naturally pointed at organizing and leading others. There are the opposite, also - dumb and dull plodders who don't seem to wish for anything more than a beer at the end of the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this the natural order of the world? Perhaps. But I think the natural order has been turned on its head from the industrial age onward.
           </p>
           <p>
            There used to be a contract between the boss and his men, if they did as he asked then he would take care of them. A good boss would reward his people and create a community out of the group. We all know how untrue that is today.
           </p>
           <p>
            So is the proper course of action to eliminate all leaders, or only the bad ones? How can we tell which ones will faithfully carry out the duties of their position?

            I agree with you. Notice there's varying degrees of red pill everywhere you go. There's so much noise out there, anybody will believe what they want. This includes the narrative that pizza gate is real (it is) and that Trump is doing something about it (possible, but who's word do we have to believe?).
           </p>
           <p>
            There's been nothing to prove to me he's taking them to war yet. There's been a ton of kvetching and the same narrative they ran with Obama... "we'd get more done but these darn obstructionists in the opposition party". Then you have a retarded AG to blame. Give him some controlled and benign victories (NK, Syria, muh economy).
           </p>
           <p>
            We'll see what happens term two. I hope he opens up more.

             There is a new theory regarding the swamp draining that says John Mcain was executed after being tried for treason, and that his brain cancer and decision to stop chemo were a cover (would you die after 1 day from stopping chemo? I don't think so).  So if this is true (which I hope it is although there is no direct evidence I've seen) but if it is then surly Hillary shouldn't be too far behind, considering they were both having "Ankle Problems" at the same time, So I'm definitely gonna be watching Killary's health more closely this year.

              I've considered that about McCain also. I agree, you don't die overnight. Also on the ankles.

              In honest self criticism, why the cover? Why not out them? Make the traitors cower and hide. Or perhaps the silence is what's scaring them the most? Or is it just the fact that there is only one option for (((media)))?

               I put it down to the "Admiralty Royalty" bit and the political cover that might bring. With all the praise the MSM have given Mcain over the years it would look pretty bad to have to admit that he was a traitor, for the country too, so in short for better optics?

             I agree about the pizzagate being real. Back when Jimmy Saville died and all those girls came forward about how he had been raping preteen girls all over england that was when I realized the elites are all pedos. If he could be so blatant uet get away with it, and be so close to members of the royal family and the british government, then they must be corrupt. Then I started hearing about Jeffery Epstein and even crazier stories, like how the invasion of Panama in the 80s was basically just to shut Noriega up about the Bush family having pedo parties in Panama. So when pizzagate came around I had no doubt that they were part of the pedo elite.

              The other possibility I've heard that seems very likely is there are factions of elites. The current one in power runs pedo rings. Trump acts like the perfect mob boss. He is probably from a different sect of elites, considering his pedigree. His "club" doesn't like the pedos, even though they may do other shady things. Notice how the (Fred) Trump-Tesla connection was beat out by Edison and whoever else.

               This is my less paranoid conspiracy theory. I tell people it's basically a mob war, Trump backed by the military and the rank-and-file of the federal police forces, the Clinton side backed by the CIA, state department, and other globalist organizations. It could be that too. But I usually conclude with "no matter who wins, they aren't on our side".

            If you haven't noticed.  Public education barely scratches the surface of historic events.  And, then you have the question of who is writing the material to cover and coming up with the policy of what can/can't be taught in school.  But, you haven't made a point of what purpose teaching this portion of history would cover.

           <p>
            Also, Obama era DS was exporting more illegals then anybody up to that point.  The legal immigration wasn't really messed with too much.  The only point I could see was Obama era DS pushing through as many illegals to become legal as possible to buffer Dem votes.

           <p>
            You could put it that way.  People who do vote have a tendency to continue to back people that they voted for.  But, people who do not vote are generally disengaged from the political process entirely.  There are a handful of people who do not vote as a political statement, but these people are just wasting their time as nobody else cares.  The politically disengaged don't care, and people who have voted tell them to shut the fuck up because they didn't make a choice.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, let's get to the fact that there's an active movement to attempt to get people to disengage from politics.  As I'm reading through and commenting on this shit post (as it is a shit post full of illogical marxist crap) I get the feeling that this is the whole point of your post.  A function of disengagement is easier control of the masses.  "Don't try to put pressure for what you want."  "We can destroy the system if not enough people care."  "Let up so that one of the parties has an easier time."  Multiple reasons for wanting disengagement.  Fuck you.

           <p>
            Yes, let's put a massive crook up against a guy who actually is running on a platform of what people want.  If Trump wasn't on the bill disengagement would have been higher (as you expected).  But, you are not presenting a reason besides bourgeois like when people back the government.

           <p>
            Here's a concept for you.  There were no outside choices for decades.  Trump may be a relatively inside choice, but he wasn't deeply inbedded like previous presidents.  You also have the whole marxist bullshit going rampant on the world stage.  There's a lot more reasons to be political than trump.  I'd have to say most of this movement started around gamer gate to be honest.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, that is a conspiracy on itself.  Why would the "Deep State" start fucking with "the opiate of the masses"?  Try going down that rabbit holes and you can create all the stupid narratives you want.

Barack "America is getting browner and no one can change that" Obama didn't purposely settle immigrants in majority white areas? And all wars are religious, sure. Wait, what was religion? Oh right, the thing the rulers used to justify their positions of power. I like that in one breath you can say the economy was tanking because of military debt and H1b visas and in the next you can say the working class are just blaming the rich for their poor life choices.

               I ignored your question because it was buried at the bottom of a wall of inconsistent bullshit. My post is about how Trump, who is a lifelong member of the elite, seems to be playing the role of making mild changes to calm the masses. You countered with a bunch of illogical and irrelevant bullshit. Then you ask a stupid question totally unrelated to what I was saying, in what seems to be an attempt at derailing the conversation. So no, I won't answer your stupid question, and I laugh at your butthurt.

            Interesting take for sure, but SO SO much more seems to be going on behind the scenes, as gleened from the Q leaks, that this doesn't account for. Of course Q COULD be a larp, but if it is then it is being orchestrated by people that are way way smarter then I am because they have made it all so fucking convincing. I refuse to fully trust that Trump is our savior until I see Hillery, Obama, and Soros all in chains, but for now at least I support him as its the best option for right now.

             Sometimes I wonder if he isn’t part of their plan, being used as an experiment to reveal leaks in their propaganda machine, especially internet - how stories spread, how movements can be squashed, etc.

              The derp state isn't all-powerful, just shady and thuggish. He has his own private security and he eats fast food to avoid poisoning. He wouldn't do all of that if he were a stooge.

               He wouldn't eat fast food if he were a stooge? So what did it mean when he goes out to fancy restaurants for steaks, is he stooging on those days only?

            That is an interesting take that cannot be dismissed as invalid. I think your scenario is in play, whether it’s the forefront of their intention or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are producers and administrators in this world. The administration always wants to try and establish themselves as more important, because at any point the producers decide to cut them out; they are utterly fucking worthless and will die off quickly. They must convince producers of their worth and importance. They last only as long as producers believe their lies.

            He has been constricting immigration across the board since he took office - causing wages to rise. How does that jibe with your theory?

             As a minor reform. Halting immigration for a while does nothing for the massive amount of foreigners already considered citizens. Borders can be reopened at any time, and the ruling class sure ain't mexicans.

              Also don't forget that at least one Jew that supports the Kalergi Plan said they were going too fast with it in America, and they needed to slow it down or risk a backlash they don't control. Trump COULD be that slowdown. I still support him for now, based on everything I've seen going down behind the scenes with Q, but I'm still not 100% sure. I'm never 100% sure on anything these days.

              True, but Trump's administration has also started reviewing naturalized citizens &amp; the process of deporting those who've lied or committed fraud to become citizens. Also recently changed USCIS from a customer service oriented processor, to part of the enforcement network. And you consider those mere minor changes, eh? All those ICE raids at places of employment as mere kabuki theater?

               Yes, like I said the borders can be reopened any time. How many large corporations are being brought to trail for violating labor laws? Like I said, the elite ain't mexicans, they don't care if the illegals get shit on any more than they care about us.

              50 million illegals? I though it was closer to 20, in spite of "official" estimates of 11-12.

               Look at the official population of states like California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, N. Mexico, and Texas. Next look at those states unfunded liabilities, especially public schools and hospitals. The information is hard to find(census data is eight years old now) on the web and it takes some extrapolation, but if you really want to know you can find the truth. The truth on illegals is buried deeper than the number of unemployed in this country.

                I live in California, own land, a couple businesses, and pay taxes here. I easily believe the "official" numbers to be off by about 100%, to 20 million. But I don't see evidence of 500%, and wonder where your numbers come from, that's all.

                What really grinds my gears, is seeing places in LA that have more voters showing up during election that people registered, and all of them voting for socialist wack nut Democrats. And Guatemalans not taking enough heat, they've replaced Mexicans in many places here as the top illegal demographic, and even the Mexican illegals are afraid of the Guatemalan criminals.

                It's not the unemployed illegals that get my blood hot &amp; angry, as much as the illegals who steal identities and get a job. I don't care how much they pay into the socialist security system, land they buy, or whatever - that job was garnered through fraud, and in aggregate it affects the entire labor market.

                 We don't disagree on principles, just numbers. Take care out there.

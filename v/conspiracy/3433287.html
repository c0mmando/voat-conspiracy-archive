              I call Kurt Nimmo "The Duke" .. after Henry Stafford 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who allegedly murdered 12 yo King Edward V of England with his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, in the Tower of London April 9, 1483, at the behest of their uncle Richard Plantagenet the Duke of Gloucester.
             </p>
             <p>
              Who was crowned King Richard III June 24, 1483, Buckingham then changed sides on behalf of his cousin Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond who also wanted to be King and was beheaded for his trouble November 2, the same year.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Nimmo was the grand champion of 911 truth, his flagship site Another Day in the Empire 1 was the definitive article on contemporary alternative journalism, no topic was too tough no shaggy suicide or suspicious death was too rough, and his eye was firmly fixed upon the Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had concluded the dancing Israeli's filming the 911 event and President Bush's sighting of the first air strike from a school in Florida, inculpated the White House and the Zionist lobby all at once.
            </p>
            <p>
             He had further concluded that since the evidence was so obvious and so damning, anyone who failed to draw the same conclusions as he was either a stretcher case retard or was in on it.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was particularly hard down on Ron Paul and Barak Obama for their total lack of morals, insofar as one was a septuagenarian veteran of twenty years in the Congress trumpeting the same BS that OBL and nineteen more did it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other an Illinois State Senator, whose rapid elevation from zero to hero was by the machinations of Zionist press barons not the American ppl.
            </p>
            <p>
             ADE 1 closed down and ADE 2 appeared, whence Nimmo forgot 911 truth and suddenly Ron Paul was a good guy who should be President, then when his internet only spam induced campaign faltered Nimmo climbed onto the Barak Obama bandwagon.

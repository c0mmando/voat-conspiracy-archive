            Galena is often mined along with lots of lead, soo don't lick your diodes. Keep more of these links coming, don't mind the salty quips.

            HERE WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE RECTENNA. A RECTENNA IS A CRYSTAL RADIO WITHOUT THE WASTED ENERGY OF CONVERTING RADIO WAVES INTO MUSIC. INSTEAD OF SPLITTING THE RADIO WAVE INTO MANY SMALL WAVES AND FILTERING OUT THE ONES WE DONT WANT TO LISTEN TO, WERE GOING TO USE THE WHOLE THING.
           </p>
           <p>
            RECTENNAS ARE VERY SIMPLE. THEY ATTRACT RADIO WAVES AS AC ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY. THEY CONVERT IT TO DC WITH A DIODE SUCH AS GERMANIUM AND THEN THIS DC CURRENT IS USED TO MAKE SHIT HAPPEN BEFORE IT RETURNS TO THE GROUND.

            A crystal radio receiver, also called a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, is a very simple radio receiver, popular in the early days of radio. It needs no other power source but that received solely from the power of radio waves received by a wire antenna. It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena.[1] This component is now called a diode.
           </p>
           <p>
            Crystal radios are the simplest type of radio receiver[2] and can be made with a few inexpensive parts, such as a wire for an antenna, a coil of copper wire for adjustment, a capacitor, a crystal detector, and earphones.[3] Crystal radios are distinct from ordinary radios as they are passive receivers, while other radios use a separate source of electric power such as a battery or the mains power to amplify the weak radio signal so as to make it louder. Thus, crystal sets produce rather weak sound and must be listened to with sensitive earphones, and can only receive stations within a limited range.[4]
           </p>
           <p>
            The rectifying property of crystals was discovered in 1874 by Karl Ferdinand Braun,[5][6][7] and crystal detectors were developed and applied to radio receivers in 1894 by Jagadish Chandra Bose,[8][9] in 1904 by G. W. Pickard,[10] and others. Crystal radios were the first widely used type of radio receiver,[11] and the main type used during the wireless telegraphy era.[12] Sold and homemade by the millions, the inexpensive and reliable crystal radio was a major driving force in the introduction of radio to the public, contributing to the development of radio as an entertainment medium with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920.[13]
           </p>
           <p>
            Around 1920, crystal sets were superseded by the first amplifying receivers, which used vacuum tubes, after which crystal sets became obsolete for commercial use.[11] They continued to be built by hobbyists, youth groups, and the Boy Scouts[14] mainly as a way of learning about the technology of radio. Today they are still sold as educational devices, and there are groups of enthusiasts devoted to their construction.[15][16][17][18][19]
           </p>
           <p>
            Crystal radios receive amplitude modulated (AM) signals, and can be designed to receive almost any radio frequency band, but most receive the AM broadcast band.[20] A few receive shortwave bands, but strong signals are required. The first crystal sets received wireless telegraphy signals broadcast by spark-gap transmitters at frequencies as low as 20 kHz.[21][22]

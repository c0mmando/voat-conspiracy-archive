Police report: Man arrested near White House is ex-cop, had arsenal in car
BY CRIMESIDER STAFF</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER 25, 2017 / 6:35 PM / CBS/AP</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Court documents reveal that the man arrested near the White House is a former Memphis police officer who had an arsenal of weapons in his car and believed the CIA had implanted a chip in his head.</p>
<p>The man, 37-year-old Timothy J. Bates of Collierville, Tennessee, was arrested early Sunday morning near the White House. He made his first court appearance Monday on charges of illegally carrying a rifle or shotgun.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Bates was approached by uniformed members of the Secret Service as he appeared to be urinating. He told the officers that he was trying to reach Defense Secretary James Mattis or the director of the National Security Agency, Adm. Mike Rogers, &quot;for advice on missing paychecks and how to get the dog chip out of my head,&quot; the police report said.</p>
<p>Bates gave officers permission to search his illegally parked car, and they discovered nine firearms including a Bushmaster assault rifle and a loaded AK-47. Investigators also seized &quot;multiple rounds&quot; of ammunition including numerous extended magazines, a folding knife, a blackjack and brass knuckles.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Memphis Police Department confirmed to CBS affiliate WREG that Bates was an officer from 2000 until 2013, when he retired. The department did not comment further.</p>
<p>The court documents say Bates was &quot;involuntarily committed for mental health reasons in Tennessee&quot; in February of 2017.</p>
<p>He was reportedly transported to a Washington hospital for observation before being booked on criminal charges.</p>
<p>Police: Man caught with weapons, 900 rounds of ammo warns ‘justice is coming’
POSTED 7:19 AM, OCTOBER 5, 2017, BY ERYN TAYLOR AND AP</p>
<p>WASHINGTON COUNTY, Tenn. — New information has been released about the man caught carrying numerous weapons and more than 900 rounds of ammunition in east Tennessee.</p>
<p>According to CBS affiliate WJHL, Scott Edmisten was “unsteady” and “very angry” when authorities pulled him over during a traffic stop this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, WREG reported Edmisten was driving on a suspended license when he was caught going 55 mph in a 30 mph zone. He allegedly floored it, reaching speeds of 80 mph before finally coming to a stop and taken into custody.</p>
<p>An inventory of his vehicle recovered a loaded .357 magnum, a loaded .45 semi auto, a full auto AR rifle in .223 caliber, a full auto AR rifle in .308 caliber, over 900 rounds of ammunition, a mask and black fatigues. Neither of the full auto rifles were registered and the serial numbers were gone.</p>
<p>Four other guns were reportedly discovered inside the suspect’s home as officer’s executed a search warrant. One had been altered to make it fully automatic. Investigators also found about $6,000 worth of ammunition that hadn’t been opened.</p>
<p>Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal told the Associated Press while guns and ammunition are common in Tennessee, it was “odd” for all the guns and clips to be loaded. In addition, he said, when people have survival gear with them, they are usually going hunting, but that didn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Deputies also said Edmisten wouldn’t make eye contact with them and at one point stated “I know this is about CPS, and I promise you they will get the justice that is coming.” When asked what that meant, “[Edmisten] stated all I needed to know is that justice is coming and I could add myself to that list,” police reports read.</p>
<p>The documents also stated the suspect made threats towards officers and staff, lunged at them and even confessed to making the weapons fully automatic. However, he stated he had not been able to test it out yet.</p>
<p>When asked why he had the guns, he responded saying “all it takes is one.”</p>
<p>Further investigation reveals Edmisten was already on police radar after he allegedly sent “hostile” letters to judges in east Tennessee.  He had also just recently lost custody of his children.</p>
<p>Graybeal said he didn’t know why Edmisten lost custody, but that the suspect made it clear he did not like the Department of Children’s Services or law enforcement.</p>
<p>“Whatever he had planned for that morning, that little traffic stop that one of my guys made made all the difference in the world to someone, I believe,” Graybeal said.</p>
<p>Edmisten has been jailed without bond on charges of possessing prohibited weapons, speeding, and felony evading arrest. An attorney listed in court records as representing Edmisten didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. A bond hearing was set for Oct. 11.</p>
<p>Michael Knight, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, has confirmed that the agency is investigating and said authorities “don’t see a connection” to recent mass shootings.</p>
<p>Edmisten’s arrest came a day after Stephen Paddock opened fire on a music festival from a high-rise hotel suite in Las Vegas, leaving 59 people dead and more than 500 injured. When police stormed his room, they discovered that Paddock had killed himself.</p>
<p>Texas Man Facing Weapons Charges Said He Was On Classified Government Mission “Dealing With A Virus”</p>
<p>TEWKSBURY — Police and the FBI are investigating the intentions of a 59-year-old Texas man who man was caught with a massive weapons cache in a Tewksbury hotel before he told investigators he was on a classified mission for a government agency he refused to name.
That man and his common law wife are now both being held without bail as they face over 40 criminal charges, a dangerousness hearing, and investigation by groups that include the Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Francho Bradley, of 4378 Ballymena Lane, Frisco, Texas, called police Sunday about 3:47 p.m. to report he believed someone was trying to break into his room at the Marriott Residence Inn, 1775 Andover St., according to Tewksbury police.</p>
<p>A police report says Bradley had a surveillance video feed of his hotel room in his car, and was concerned because the video feed died as he was driving toward Boston.</p>
<p>Bradley asked police to check his room since he admitted there was an unsecured gun in a drawer inside and because he “didn’t want the gun to get into the wrong hands,” according to a police report.
But when Tewksbury police entered Bradley’s room, they found far more than just one gun.</p>
<p>Officers immediately noticed several rifles sticking out of a green flight suit that had been wrapped around them and laid on the room’s floor, according to a police report. There were no signs of a break in, according to police.</p>
<p>Bradley and his common law wife, Adrianne Jennings, 40, of 8247 Brightside Lane, Frisco, Texas, were both detained when they returned to the hotel. Bradley has an active firearms license from Texas, but it is not valid in Massachusetts, according to police.</p>
<p>Police obtained a search warrant for the room and Bradley’s vehicle, and ended up finding eight large-capacity guns, including an AK-47, and an AR-15 that was equipped with a bump stock, a grenade launcher, and a silencer, according to a police report.</p>
<p>Officers also found 19 large-capacity magazines for various guns, dozens of rounds of ammunition, laptop computers, cell phones, walkie talkies, tactical vests, and smoke grenades among other items, according to a police report.</p>
<p>“It should be noted that five of the high capacity magazines were affixed to each other by a homemade case. This was concerning because it allows an individual to shoot off all five magazines in a short amount of time,” police wrote in a report.</p>
<p>When interviewed by police, Bradley said he brought the weapons with him from Texas because he “needed them with him for his mission.”</p>
<p>“Francho went on to say he can’t tell us what he does for work or why he has all the guns with him, but that he is down in this area working for a government agency that is dealing with a virus,” police wrote in a report.</p>
<p>Bradley declined to name the agency or say more because he said the information was classified, according to a police report. Bradley told officers there was no one they could call to verify the information, according to a police report.</p>
<p>At one point Bradley told police he owns Ensyme Engineering, but did not want to comment on what the company does.</p>
<p>Robert Normandin, who represented Bradley at arraignment, said his client is an Army veteran and that Enysma Engineering sells accessories such as communication devices to the military and other clients.
Normandin said the weapons and accessories were “props” that Bradley uses while conducting that business.</p>
<p>Normandin said the gun accessories found by police are not actually functional, though he said he was not immediately sure if the guns themselves were functional.</p>
<p>The website for Enysma Engineering says the company strives “to help business owners develop a solid foundation and operational strategy so they can be successful.”</p>
<p>While the website touts products such as walkie talkies and headsets, it makes no mention of guns or firearm accessories.</p>
<p>Bradley told officers he worked for Los Angeles Police for about five years around 1984, but Los Angeles police told Tewksbury officers they could not immediately confirm whether Bradley ever worked there, according to a police report.</p>
<p>Bradley and Jennings are both charged with 8 counts of possession of a large-capacity firearm, 19 counts of possession of a large capacity feeding device, 8 counts of improper storage of a firearm, three counts of possession of an infernal machine, three counts of possession of a silencer, and one count each of possession of a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a license, and possession of a bump stock.</p>',

           Texas Man Facing Weapons Charges Said He Was On Classified Government Mission “Dealing With A Virus”
          </p>

           TEWKSBURY — Police and the FBI are investigating the intentions of a 59-year-old Texas man who man was caught with a massive weapons cache in a Tewksbury hotel before he told investigators he was on a classified mission for a government agency he refused to name.
That man and his common law wife are now both being held without bail as they face over 40 criminal charges, a dangerousness hearing, and investigation by groups that include the Joint Terrorism Task Force.

          </p>
          <p>
           Police obtained a search warrant for the room and Bradley’s vehicle, and ended up finding eight large-capacity guns, including an AK-47, and an AR-15 that was equipped with a bump stock, a grenade launcher, and a silencer, according to a police report.
          </p>
          <p>
           Officers also found 19 large-capacity magazines for various guns, dozens of rounds of ammunition, laptop computers, cell phones, walkie talkies, tactical vests, and smoke grenades among other items, according to a police report.
          </p>
          <p>
           “It should be noted that five of the high capacity magazines were affixed to each other by a homemade case. This was concerning because it allows an individual to shoot off all five magazines in a short amount of time,” police wrote in a report.

          </p>
          <p>
           At one point Bradley told police he owns Ensyme Engineering, but did not want to comment on what the company does.
          </p>
          <p>
           Robert Normandin, who represented Bradley at arraignment, said his client is an Army veteran and that Enysma Engineering sells accessories such as communication devices to the military and other clients.
Normandin said the weapons and accessories were “props” that Bradley uses while conducting that business.
          </p>
          <p>
           Normandin said the gun accessories found by police are not actually functional, though he said he was not immediately sure if the guns themselves were functional.

            . Billionaire investor George Soros bet millions of dollars that MGM Resorts International would experience a downturn in the months before the Las Vegas shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to SEC filings from mid August, Soros purchased $42 million dollars worth of puts on the booming business industry, which indicates that he expected a market downturn for some reason and he anticipated making a lot of money off of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros, noted for his support of leftist activism and support for radical leftist politicians, stood to make a killing off of a drop in the market price of resort shares. But he wasn’t the only one betting big that something bad was coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even more suspicious, MGM’s CEO, James Murren, coolly divested himself of 80% of the shares he owned in his own company in the days before the ex-dividend date on September 8th, 2017. These actions were surprising at the time because his resorts shares were doing quite well, especially in light of the fact that on Tuesday, September 5th, 2017, the board of MGM Resorts International decided to approve a $1 billion share repurchase program. At $17.7 billion today, the program represented a significant portion of its then market cap.
           </p>
           <p>
            This meant that the CEO made a tidy profit, but that he also got out before the shares fell. The sales were originally disclosed in a document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Murren had previously divested 57,269 shares on July 31st and August 9th, 2017, during the same time period that Soros was placing his put options.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Las Vegas attack on Sunday, October 1st, caused shares of casino operators to fall the following Monday. MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay hotel near where the shooting occurred, fell 5.6 percent that day. Other resorts also slipped, though not by the same amount as Wynn Resorts slipped 1.2 percent. Las Vegas Sands fell as much as 2.1 percent before closing higher.
           </p>
           <p>
            Analysts with investment bank Morgan Stanley forecast the shooting will decrease demand for the Las Vegas market for about six months and have a 4 percent to 6 percent economic effect, which is not huge in the long run, but when tens of millions of dollars are changing hands, those kind of numbers mean a lot of money to winners.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one knows what compelled Murren to sell, sell, sell, but the actions don’t really make any sense in context. Why would any profit-oriented CEO of any company sell 80% of his personal stake in his own corporation, especially after he thought it was in the business’ best interest to initiate a massive share repurchase program which one would theoretically assume to reduce the number of shares in the company and increase the price of each share. Also, why would the individual with the most information about the company sell 80% of his shares immediately after the commencement of a program that most would consider positive for the stock? Shouldn’t he want to hold on to his shares? Is there something he knew, that others didn’t, that lead to so much movement in such little time? And did Soros know something no one else knew as well?

            Posted August 4 2017. A luxury tower on the Las Vegas Strip will turn into posh military barracks starting Saturday.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Middle Eastern air force has booked the entire W Las Vegas, a 289-room tower at the SLS Las Vegas, for most of August, according to numerous employees speaking on the condition they not be identified. They said employees are being shuffled around to accommodate the booking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Greta Vanhersecke, a publicist for W Las Vegas, confirmed that a group has booked the hotel for August but declined to say who it was. A search of the W Las Vegas website shows the hotel is sold out from Saturday night through Aug 28.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the employees identified the group as the Royal Saudi Air Force. A spokesman for the Royal Saudi Air Force based in Washington, D.C., could not be reached at his office. The spokesman did not respond to email requests for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi Arabia’s 10th Squadron Royal Saudi Air Force will be taking part in Red Flag 17-4 at Nellis Air Force Base, according to airwingspotter.com, a site dedicated to military aviation photography and spotting. Red Flag, combat training involving the air, space and cyberforces of the United States and its allies, will be held Aug. 14-25.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Nellis public affairs department said in an email that it does not disclose the participants of its joint exercises, adding that any participant has the right to choose its own lodging.
           </p>
           <p>
            “While we encourage foreign participants to stay in our base lodging for ease of travel during the exercise, they are welcome to make arrangements anyplace they prefer,” the statement said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Employees from S&amp;K Technologies were visible at the W Las Vegas this week. S&amp;K Technologies has provided logistics support to the Royal Saudi Air Force during Red Flag operations for many years, according to a 2014 post on S&amp;K’s website.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Depending on the year, the Royal Saudi Air Force will bring 175-210 members to these realistic combat exercises,” S&amp;K said in the 2014 post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some areas closed to public
           </p>
           <p>
            The W pool, bar and salon will be closed to the public for the duration of the booking, according to employees. Three oversize portraits of women had been removed from the bar by Wednesday evening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most reception, concierge and valet workers will be temporarily moved to other positions within the SLS Las Vegas for the month, the employees said. One W Las Vegas employee put the number of affected personnel at between 20 and 30.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some workers will be relocated next door to the other SLS towers, according to employees who spoke with the Review-Journal. The SLS converted one of its three towers to a W Hotel last year in an attempt to boost business. Marriott International owns the W Hotel brand.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some employees will be moved to W properties in Denver and Seattle, according to W Las Vegas employees. Vanhersecke said only two employees will be moved off property. She declined to further discuss employees moves.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Everyone will have full-time employment during the time of the buyout and will have their positions at the end of August,” Vanhersecke said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Three employees interviewed by the Review-Journal said female employees will probably not work at the W Hotel during the month. Vanhersecke declined to comment on whether female employees are being relocated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reina Herschdorfer, director of marketing, national meetings and events at Caesars Entertainment and a 20-year industry veteran, said it is unusual to move employees to other premises, though it can make sense if one location is very busy and needs help.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International said groups occasionally request the use of their own servers and kitchen staff on a limited basis, but such requests don’t affect employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Under these arrangements, the hotel continues to provide a majority of the staff, including supervisors, servers and additional kitchen support staff. As a result, we do not have job displacement,” said Yvette Monet, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts.
           </p>

            New York, Washington, D.C.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Saudis are behind the booking, it would not be the first time they took over a U.S. hotel.
           </p>
           <p>
            In November 2010, more than 100 guests at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City were moved to another hotel when a contingent of Saudi princes and officials accompanying then-King Abdullah took up residence for a few days, according to The New York Times.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entourage of Saudi Arabia King Salman bought out the entire 222-room Four Seasons in Georgetown, one of Washington, D.C.’s most expensive hotels, for several days in September 2015, according to Politico. Nicole Otero, a spokeswoman for the hotel, declined to say whether employees were shuffled around during that stay.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Saudi prince owns 47.5 percent of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, which operates more than 100 hotels around the world, including one in Las Vegas.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokesman for the Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas said Saudi delegations normally stay at their property, but that they did not receive any group request for August.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike the W Las Vegas, the Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas is not a stand-alone structure. It is located on the top five floors of Mandalay Bay. The Four Seasons also has 133 more rooms than the W.
           </p>
           <p>
            A room at the W Las Vegas with a king-size bed booked for one week starting Aug. 29 costs at least $1,461. That suggests the Saudis may be paying as much as $1.4 million for their stay, excluding food and other amenities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The booking will be a boon for the W hotel and property owner SLS, which have struggled to attract visitors to the north end of the Strip since opening in August 2014. Alex Meruelo, a Reno casino owner, agreed earlier this year to buy the SLS. That deal is expected to be completed in September.

            They're using clowns hard this year like in 2012 but even more so i fear they are looking to repeat 2012 style mass shootings. Clown world and honkler is a psy op. It's clear that was planted on purpose.

            I fear with the clown related happening this year like 2012 again i fear they want a rerun of 2012 like a clown shooting up a movie theater and a school shooting. Pay attention to all the clown related this year it's all about the clown. We got to do something to stop them from repeating 2012 mass shootings but worse.

            Amdocs. Oh i remember. The Jews and Mossad used fronts and kids toys and all this other stuff like Urban Moving Systems like a front of course it's to cover ass so that explains Francho's Enysma Engineering and Ultra Life and Wackenhut. Enysma Engineering is Urban Moving Systems in this case. Fronts. Facades.

            It’s 10 a.m. on a Friday morning and James Valentine’s alarm is still going off.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Maroon 5 guitarist has just gotten out of bed for an interview, awakened early after staying up late.
           </p>
           <p>
            He’ll need to get used to it — the latter part, at least.
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s because for the fourth time in the past five years, Maroon 5 is coming to Vegas for a two-night stand at Mandalay Bay Events Center during New Year’s Eve weekend.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Vegas is the place to be on New Year’s,” Valentine says. “It really has become a hardcore tradition for us. We turn it into a party for ourselves, too. We invite a lot of our friends out from Los Angeles — and from all over. My family usually comes in from Utah. It’s a huge party.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s something new this time around, though: The band will be hitting town for the first time since the release of its sixth album, “Red Pill Blues,” which came out in November.
           </p>
           <p>
            RED PILL BLUES OH COME ON COME THE FUCK ON. Bruno Mars MARS COME ON. And that damned music video for what lovers do.

            The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs purchased around 600 firearms and nearly 20,000 rounds of ammunition, along with riot gear and camouflage uniforms. The VHA has claimed that these purchases are for “enforcing federal law at VA medical facilities (and some National Cemetery and Benefits locations).”
           </p>
           <p>
            The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Social Security Administration (SSA) purchased around 300 firearms and 250,000 rounds of ammunition. The SSA’s OIG has stated that it uses these items for investigations into “wrongdoing by applicants, beneficiaries, contractors and third parties, and employees.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The National Park Service (NPS) of the U.S. Department of the Interior purchased nearly 2 million rounds, approximately 1,500 firearms, silencers, riot shields and batons, camouflage uniforms and “pyrotechnics and specialized munitions.” The stated purpose of these items is to protect “the safety and health of NPS visitors, partners, and staff, as well as our natural and cultural resources.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Though those numbers certainly seem large — maybe even astoundingly so — on their own, they are part of a years-long effort that began during the Obama administration that has seen many non-military federal agencies arm themselves to the teeth.

            DHS buys five bullets for every American man, woman and child
           </p>
           <p>
            As the recently released GAO report notes, from FY 2010 to FY 2017, non-military federal agencies spent $1.5 billion on ammunition, weapons and military grade tactical gear. As an example, during that time frame, the VA bought 11 million rounds of ammunition, roughly equivalent to 2,800 rounds for each of its 3,957 officers. Similarly, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has purchased 4 million rounds over the past eight years and acquired 1 million rounds for use by its 461 special agents. The HHS has called its arms purchases “imperative.” In addition, the SSA bought 800,000 rounds for their 270 special agents during this period, amounting to nearly 3,000 rounds per agent. Even the U.S. Postal Service acquired significant amounts of weapons and ammunition.
           </p>
           <p>
            These purchases in the past have been the subject of some controversy, such as the mass purchases of hollow-point rounds by government agencies including the Forest Service, National Park Service, Office of Inspector General, Bureau of Fiscal Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals, and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Hollow-point bullets are illegal under the Geneva Convention but government agencies spent at least $426,268 in just two years (FY 2015 and FY 2016) to acquire them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ammunition purchases by the Department of Homeland Security in 2013 were also controversial and were subsequently investigated by the GAO. DHS had claimed that is was buying over a billion rounds of ammunition, including hollow-point rounds, in order to “save money.” However, this has long been in doubt, given that hollow-point rounds are significantly more expensive than other rounds that do not expand upon impact.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time, Forbes noted that the massive ammo purchases by DHS could be used to sustain a “hot war” for more than twenty years, given that during the height of the Iraq War the Army used around 6 million rounds per month. With its planned purchase of 1.6 billion rounds, DHS would have ammo left over after matching the Army’s peak daily outpouring of hot lead for two solid decades.

            If Omar Mateen or Eric Paddock ever crossed paths oh boy. I am going to explain about G4S, Contemporary Services Corp., and Wackenhut. Along with Michael Chertoffs ultra Mossad Zionist ties and his time at FEMA/DHS and his Chertoff Group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suchomel presented Facebook messages associated with her account. Suchomel’s claims also allude to multiple shooters involved in the Las Vegas shooting, as she allegedly planned to “organize a group of survivors,” and that “The media can suck it. They have no idea what went down!”
           </p>
           <p>
            The intelligence monitoring group called SITE, has ties to both the CIA and Israeli intelligence. The group has also had ethical concerns raised over the nature of their intel gathering in the last decade and according to the group’s founder, Rita Katz – they’ve managed to release terror related material linked to ISIS prior to the group itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘GEO GROUP’ – A private-for-profit corrections and detention firm formerly known as Wackenhut Corrections Corporation under the umbrella of The Wackenhut Corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you’re about to see below, is a collection of material revealing what appears to be a rather incredible financial component connected to the High Desert Phoenix Foundation, a charitable organization co-founded by the deceased Las Vegas mass shooting survivor Kymberley Suchomel.
           </p>
           <p>
            The High Desert Phoenix Foundation claims to have raised funds for grieving families affected by trauma since 2008. This amazing coincidence, rather incredibly, has not been mentioned once in any of the conspiratorial claims surrounding the Suchomel story at alternative media outlets. Put another way, a survivor of a traumatic event has been a long time co-founder of a foundation that contends to have helped those who have endured a traumatic tragedy themselves. It’s a difficult question to ask – but what are the chances of this uncanny coincidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, new evidence uncovers details concerning the High Desert Phoenix Foundation’s high-profile sponsors, one that includes the The GEO Group, Inc (GEO). This long time financial donor, is also linked to well-known government contractor security firms. Is this also a coincidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            In recent years, controversy has enveloped the multi-billion-dollar corporation known as Geo Group. Critics of GEO Group contend that politically motivated contributions have led to an expansion of its for-profit prisons system through federal, state and government contractual agreements at the expense of public safety. Even more concerning, is that critics argue that GEO Group has fostered a dangerous work environment via it’s under staffed operations, inadequate training and apparent mistreatment of detainees and other inmates. This has led to a potentially volatile situation for communities nearby GEO Group’s facilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            QUESTION: Does this sound like a suitable donor for a charitable foundation known for helping grieving families?
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1984, Wackenhut Corrections Corporation (WCC) had been formed as a part of The Wackenhut Corporation. In 2003, WCC management bought up all stock held by its subsidiary G4S, altering its name to The GEO Group, Inc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2004, other divisions of the Wackenhut Corporation were purchased by Group 4 Falck, a security focused subsidiary known as G4S Wackenhut, was later renamed again as G4S Secure Solutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason why the GEO Group link is so significant, is that prior to modern America’s largest mass shooting in Las Vegas, an apparent survivor of the incident was operating a foundation that was accepting financial support from a large-scale company formerly known as The Wackenhut Corporation, a subsidiary of G4S Secure Solutions, one of the world’s largest security firms, and a Department of Homeland Security connected conglomerate tied to the suspicious Orlando shooting in the summer of 2016 – an event, that was previously the country’s largest mass shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you remember, 29-year old Omar Mateen, an Afghani-American was located in Port St. Lucie, Florida, about 120 miles outside of Orlando. In 2013, Mateen was placed under a terror watch list for 10 months (interviewed two to three times by the FBI 2013-14) and had worked for G4S Secure Solutions, headquartered in Jupiter, Florida, a company which was formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm known as The Wackenhut Corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            G4S, as it turns out, was the very first ‘designated’ and certified Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contractor and recently secured a $234 million dollar contract with the federal cabinet department. In addition to apparently providing security solutions for “90 percent of U.S. nuclear facilities,” G4S, according to border patrol sources has also been tasked with the transportation and release of illegal immigrants inside the interior of the United States. At least one of Mateen’s roles with G4S, was to transport and provide security for prisoner youths in Florida.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rod Rosenstiens FBI/DOJ payed off LVPD and California police 24 million dollars after the Thousand Oaks shooting where Las Vegas shooting victims were. So i bet the same man who recommended Trump fire Comey then used it to do the Russia witch hunt also payed off cops who killed eyewitness over all these months to shut them up it's clear they bribe witnesses or kill them using cops they bribe. It's clear there's a cover up and it involves cops like the one who took weapons from the shooting and went to the field office for the ATF in Tucson AZ to destroy the weapons and all while the investigation was still ongoing which should've actually cost that LV police captain his job and possible jail time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Contemporary Services Corp. is arm and branch of the DHS and was providing security for Las Vegas that night i'm sure it would be easy for Sheldon and Michael to have made a few calls and got involved along with getting Mossad and Black Cube form Harvey Weinstein scandal involved. All this goes all the way to G4S, Wackenhut, Kimberly, Mossad, Sheldon, DHS, CSC, and Black Cube and the 12 missing Israeli's. I remember a 2004 interview with Courtney Love who said if Harvey invites you to the Four Seasons in Vegas do not go don't go. And look what happened after the Vegas shooting look at what memory holed the shooting.
           </p>

            Look at his shirt look at Eric's Central Community Arts Florida or Central Community Florida Arts shirt or what ever it is. You forget about that? Look into  them and their connections to mass shootings. G4S headquarters is in Florida in Jupiter Florida. IT'S FUCKING FLORIDA WHERE SOME OF THESE MASS SHOOTINGS HAPPENED FOR CHRIST SAKE. "Mars just fell to earth" and right on to Vegas. Do you remember the /pol/ prophecy? The constellation of the women travelling in birth and the dragon waiting to devour her baby?

            How does David Hogg, Omar Mateen, and their parents connect to FBI? David Hoggs dad was doing the same thing sort of training and thing as Nazer Hamze. David Hoggs dad needs to be looked into. Omars dad was a snitch but also covering for Omar. Parkland students visited Christchurch New Zealand before the shooting in NZ. The Mosque has connections to CAIR and terrorists. Nazer Hamze is a CAIR member, a Broward police officer, and trains Muslims at Mosques in shooting. Omar must've radicallized at a Mosque in Florida where Nazer Hamze frequents. He must've been in contact with Omar. Devon Erickson and his accomplice was called by some group who threatened to kill them, their families, and burn their houses if they didn't do the shooting. Garland Texas shooter was contacted by FBI who texted him to "tear up Texas" the cops who shot him sued the FBI FOR THOSE TEXTS. Omars dad was covering for Omar. So was Nazer who was training Omar.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many of these minors from Florida have juvie records and what's in them is clearly very confidential and classified by law but i wonder how many of the Parkland brats had contact with Omar? Possibly Nazer? and Hoggs dad?
           </p>
           <p>
            And was Nicholas Cruz contacted and told to do the shooting or bullied into snapping and doing it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was there an active shooting drill the day of the Parkland shooting and who was helping the Broward PD with the active shooting drill? They day there is an active shooting drill and a kid who went to school there who was a known threat goes there to shoot it up? Sounds like the cops and there helpers expected the shooting and let it happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if the Mossad or cops were shooters but they did want the shooting to happen to further a narrative or financial gain and did everything they could to set Nicholas off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement and the feds has ways of making people shooters and can sometimes be shooters themselves. They make murderers and are sometimes murderers. It's like a game too them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The IRS spent $600,000 on ammunition but refused to disclose to the GAO its intended purpose and told the GAO that it could not provide data on firearms purchases. The IRS has stated in the past that such purchases are used in “investigating potential criminal violations of the Internal Revenue Code.” Its current inventory is estimated to include 4,461 firearms, including submachine guns, and over 5 million rounds of ammunition.
           </p>

            You know how Paddocks accounts were flagged for supporting terrorism hundreds of times? It lends to him being in contact with all these people and selling them gear and guns hundreds of times.

            A police report says Bradley had a surveillance video feed of his hotel room in his car, and was concerned because the video feed died as he was driving toward Boston. Kinda like what Paddock had in his room? Like a surveillance camera but for making sure his guns were safe. It was never about a sting. The Logitech camera would work with his phones or computers or car while he was driving like when he went to get the sniper rifle that was used in his room in 32-134.

            On August 12, 2017, a car was deliberately driven into a crowd of people who had been peacefully[14][15] protesting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one and injuring 28. The driver of the car, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., had driven from Ohio to attend the rally.[16] Fields previously espoused neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs.[8][9] He was convicted in a state court of hit and run, the first-degree murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, and eight counts of malicious wounding, and sentenced to life in prison. [17]:1 On March 27, 2019, he pled guilty to 29 of 30 federal charges in exchange for the prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. [17]:1
           </p>
           <p>
            A memorial service and vigils were organized. The Mayor of Charlottesville, the Virginia Secretary of Public Safety, the Attorney General and the FBI director called the attack an act of domestic terrorism.
           </p>
           <p>
            On August 21 2017 that solar eclipse happened and on August 12 2017 an anon on 4chan said the car attack was CIA and then he said something about "Henderson Nevada".
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if the dems did all this and even used 4chan to coordinate or if these guys were politically motivated but had no help from the gov. Who knows.

            Scott and Timothy were in contact and i'm sure Paddock was in contact with them all and Devin and Francho and lord knows who else. It all must tie to the atheist Bernie bro who shot up the baseball practice. On June 14, 2017, during a practice session for the annual Congressional Baseball Game for Charity in Alexandria, Virginia, James Hodgkinson shot U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, U.S. Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner, congressional aide Zack Barth, and lobbyist Matt Mika

            Virgina? Timothy J Bates connections? Crozet? The Crozet, Virginia train crash was a railway accident that occurred on January 31, 2018. A chartered Amtrak train named Congressional Special Train 923, following the route normally used by the Amtrak Cardinal and carrying a group of politicians and lawmakers from the Republican Party, collided with a garbage truck at a level crossing at Lanetown Road in Crozet, Virginia, 12 miles (19 km) west of Charlottesville, Virginia. The train was chartered by Republican lawmakers for transportation from Washington Union Station to an annual retreat at The Greenbrier in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[2] Several politicians brought their spouses and children with them for the trip; no members of the general public were passengers.

            Timothy J Bates said it was a dog chip right? So who is his owner who is his handler? He told you. He doesn't have a dog chip in his head though that's an act or slang. Why would a ex cop say he was on a mission for the CIA and get busted near the White House with a arsenal? He clearly was in contact with some one. He clearly was in contact with some one and planned to kill the president and this was 1 week before Las Vegas and then Scott gut busted the day after and then Devin Patrick Kelly TX happened the day of the paradise papers leak and also some of the people involved with the panama and paradise papers got killed at some point too.

            Francho Bradley bought a rifle or bump stock from Stephen Paddock at his Mesquite Central Park apartments. Devin Patrick Kelly bought one too. A rifle i mean or maybe a bump stock. Franco and Devin both lived in Texas which Paddock had connections to. Scott Edminston lived in Tennessee and so did Timothy J Bates. That is 2 guys connected to Texas who did or planned shootings and 2 guys connected to Tennessee who planned shootings. And that is another guy who lied about being a cop. In LA. Where the plane crashed with the one pilot who had fake CPD credentials and who also owned a Sushi restaurant in Nevada around Las Vegas and Paddock had planned to go to Chicago to try to shoot up Lollapalooza. So now we have fake cops fake government agents a cop who claimed to be MKUltra'd by CIA a guy claiming to work for the government who was on a mission to deal with a virus. And then there's this Enysma Engineering and Ultra Life and John Beilman and his suicide or murder. A BUMPSTOCK WAS FOUND WITH FRANCHO CAN YOU BELIeVE THAT? And then there's the fact Paddock was a pilot like the guy who crashed in LA and he had connections to Las Vegas and Sushi. He served Paddock Sushi. They were flying buddies. And then there's the central park gmail and outlook accounts saying guns were for sale and now we got a guy from Texas busted in Boston with a bumpstock and Paddock has ties to Texas.

            When they say the weapons were modified that means hat must mean they were modified with BUMPSTOCKS.

            Bradley asked police to check his room since he admitted there was an unsecured gun in a drawer inside and because he “didn’t want the gun to get into the wrong hands,” according to a police report.
But when Tewksbury police entered Bradley’s room, they found far more than just one gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Officers immediately noticed several rifles sticking out of a green flight suit that had been wrapped around them and laid on the room’s floor, according to a police report. There were no signs of a break in, according to police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley and his common law wife, Adrianne Jennings, 40, of 8247 Brightside Lane, Frisco, Texas, were both detained when they returned to the hotel. Bradley has an active firearms license from Texas, but it is not valid in Massachusetts, according to police.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police obtained a search warrant for the room and Bradley’s vehicle, and ended up finding eight large-capacity guns, including an AK-47, and an AR-15 that was equipped with a bump stock, a grenade launcher, and a silencer, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Officers also found 19 large-capacity magazines for various guns, dozens of rounds of ammunition, laptop computers, cell phones, walkie talkies, tactical vests, and smoke grenades among other items, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It should be noted that five of the high capacity magazines were affixed to each other by a homemade case. This was concerning because it allows an individual to shoot off all five magazines in a short amount of time,” police wrote in a report.
           </p>
           <p>
            When interviewed by police, Bradley said he brought the weapons with him from Texas because he “needed them with him for his mission.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Francho went on to say he can’t tell us what he does for work or why he has all the guns with him, but that he is down in this area working for a government agency that is dealing with a virus,” police wrote in a report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley declined to name the agency or say more because he said the information was classified, according to a police report. Bradley told officers there was no one they could call to verify the information, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            At one point Bradley told police he owns Ensyme Engineering, but did not want to comment on what the company does.
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert Normandin, who represented Bradley at arraignment, said his client is an Army veteran and that Enysma Engineering sells accessories such as communication devices to the military and other clients.
Normandin said the weapons and accessories were “props” that Bradley uses while conducting that business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normandin said the gun accessories found by police are not actually functional, though he said he was not immediately sure if the guns themselves were functional.
           </p>
           <p>
            The website for Enysma Engineering says the company strives “to help business owners develop a solid foundation and operational strategy so they can be successful.”
           </p>
           <p>
            While the website touts products such as walkie talkies and headsets, it makes no mention of guns or firearm accessories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley told officers he worked for Los Angeles Police for about five years around 1984, but Los Angeles police told Tewksbury officers they could not immediately confirm whether Bradley ever worked there, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley also claimed to have played “prominent roles” in the Obama campaign and German government, “and single handedly saved a one star general who was kidnapped a few years ago,” according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Tewksbury police checked with police in Frisco, Texas to see if they had interacted with Bradley or Jennings, they learned Bradley reported his wife missing in 2013 and told police she was a psych patient with mental issues, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jennings told police her husband was here for a job interview. She told police her husband brought the guns with him “in case he gets deployed,” but told police she couldn’t speak about what he does for work, according to a police report.
           </p>
           <p>
            At arraignment Monday, Thomas Combs, who represented Jennings, said Jennings did not own or have control of any of the weapons and accessories which belong to Bradley. Combs said Jennings was merely along for the trip with her husband.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley and Jennings are both charged with 8 counts of possession of a large-capacity firearm, 19 counts of possession of a large capacity feeding device, 8 counts of improper storage of a firearm, three counts of possession of an infernal machine, three counts of possession of a silencer, and one count each of possession of a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a license, and possession of a bump stock.
           </p>
           <p>
            Judge Ellen Caulo ordered both held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing scheduled for Friday.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one paragraph of the police report, officers noted Bradley got parking tickets in the same part of Cambridge on successive days, even though he claimed to have no ties to the city. That made officers suspect he may have been conducting surveillance, according to a police report, which also notes that the March for Our Lives was held in Boston this weekend.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, said a focus of the ongoing investigation into the couple is examining why they were here and what their intent was.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We are working closely with our state and federal partners on this investigation and will leave no stone unturned,” Tewksbury police Chief Timothy Sheehan said. “We have a lot of work left to do here.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Kristen Setera, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Boston, “At this point in time we don’t believe there is any additional threat to public safety. However, our investigation is continuing.” She declined further comment.

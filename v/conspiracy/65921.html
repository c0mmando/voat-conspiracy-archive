            Been following this for awhile.
           </p>
           <p>
            1. It seemed like a hit piece to 'curb' the rising anti-pedo sentiment. (Saville stoked the flames).
           </p>
           <p>
            2. For someone who put together so many videos there were some issues: no other witnesses, rehashed testimony and no evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            3. Lack of intelligent conversation between parents or adults on the videos: they seemed like propaganda pieces trying to evoke a reaction (and they did).
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically they showed you kids describing atrocities and asked you "please do something'! Then they published the names of a lot of people - if that's not baiting for retaliation or 'social justice' what is? Basically she doxxed these people, without benefit of evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't forget this: Atrocities against kids are happening. They uncovered a sex dungeon in a city hall last week in London.. Supposedly in operation for DECADES. -The whole society of Jimmy Saville didn't disappear when he died. They are still there, and needing some prosecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is London LAST WEEK:

           <p>
            Sex dungeons in city hall finally comes to someones attention in LONDON? Under the eyes of MI6 Scotland Yard, and police.. In a government building.. Ok. Sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL:DR: Expect this particular case to get mentioned next time someone gets too 'loud' about wanting some PEDO prosecution to take place or progress. Because THEY bury these investigations -because someone in power is complicit somewhere along the line. (The public doxxing that occurred is also a good case against criminalizing free speech online).

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mrs Justice Pauffley says claims circulating on internet are 'baseless' as she describes people who seek to perpetuate them as 'evil' or 'foolish' after fact-finding exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Claims that a "satanic cult" where children were abused by paedophiles has been operating in north London have been dismissed by a High Court judge.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mrs Justice Pauffley said detail of the claims have been circulating on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             At a family court hearing in London, she said she had been asked to investigate by social services bosses and had conducted a fact-finding exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
             The judge said in a ruling on Thursday that the claims were "baseless" and she described people who sought to perpetuate them as "evil" or "foolish".
            </p>
            <p>
             Mrs Justice Pauffley said the case centred on two children - aged eight and nine - whose parents were separated.
            </p>
            <p>
             The judge said the London Borough of Barnet had begun care proceedings in relation to the youngsters.
            </p>
            <p>
             She said that "lurid allegations of the most serious kind" were drawn to the attention of police last September.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was suggested that the youngsters were part of a large group of children from north London who belonged to a "satanic cult", the judge added.
            </p>
            <p>
             She said there were allegations of "significant paedophile activity" - allegations that children had been sexually abused and made to abuse one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mrs Justice Pauffley said allegations were made by the two children, their mother and her partner.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Specifically, it was said that babies were supplied from all over the world," she said. "The assertions were that babies had been abused, tortured and then sacrificed."

             So a judge declares it's all "baseless" and that's that? The article doesn't do anything to dissuade the allegations, other than saying a single judge has declared there's nothing to it.  Interesting.  The conspiracy allegations also state that many judges and people in positions of authority are involved, and have been instrumental in the coverup of the activities and protection of those involved.

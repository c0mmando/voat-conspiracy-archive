            This video is disingenuous.  Changing the volume on purpose while alex is yelling and saying the Bundy Ranch people killed cops.    Those people were not allowed to join the Bundy Ranch.  Nobody from the Bundy Ranch killed anyone.  This video is a lie.

             I was an Alex Jones listener for some time.  Some of it may be a lie, I don't know Alex personally.   Much of the information he puts out is true but what this video is addressing is how the information is presented.  It did get to be a bit much at the end, maybe I should have made my own take on AJ.  I don't really have the time for that so I just post and try to reply to stuff here.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I wonder is, how much of his show is dedicated to getting information out and how much is dedicated to rants.   I now prefer more densely packed information such as voat.  You can get so many perspectives so quickly, beats trying to listen to his show.
            </p>
            <p>
             I feel a bit bad about posting, but hey, I try to post interesting stuff and let you decide.

              Well he doesn't actually rant like this that often.  And it's disingenuous to change the volume on the audio to make it sound the way the people who made the video did.  Go here and hit play and you can see exactly how the show is.

               It probably was just his personality, and maybe he has changed through the years.  I haven't listened for a few years.  The two hangups I had with his show were: the long rants were more self serving than informational, and he didn't seem to offer much for solutions besides getting mad.   Things could be different now.  Going forward I'll refrain from posting any more videos like this.  You are right, it is disingenuous.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the end I think he is his own man trying to help.  I just prefer someone like James Corbett.

            If anyone watched the TV series Merlin from the 90s you remember how Merlin defeated Maab.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was a supposed god that no one could kill.  They tried to stop her through their own power, it didn't work.  They raised an army  to defeat her and she formed her own.  Merlin who had sworn not to use his magic broke his vow and tried to use his magic to defeat her.  He couldn't beat her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know how they defeated her?  They simply ignored her,  turned their back on her and never turned around.

             I wish that would work in this case, but as long as their hands are in our pockets it wont matter if we turn our backs. We have to subvert in every way possible, within the confines of law.

              It's a metaphor silly.  The idea is to go forward on creating good instead of trying to fight.  Take Bitcoin for instance, it was a way to "fight" the old system by creating a new one.

               I fully support innovating past the cage, but shining a light on the corruption is also important otherwise people wont value the innovation. Aside from that we are built into the system, there is no way to just turn away from it, within the confines of law.

                Here is what I'm saying, you have more power creating your own new system than trying to change the system.  You will find more results in your life the more you actively Create your own reality.   If you become powerful in your own reality, the people around you will start to change.

                I'd say the main thing we can do to take away centralized power to create dynamic small groups.  Basically small tribes.  That way if you want to talk to the elders about an injustice, they are only a teepee away.

                 I nearly completely agree, what you are suggesting is what I'd like. Problem is we have to play their game to some extent, if we don't authorities will show up and take what you have, your possessions, your freedom, your health, etc... There is currently no way to just turn your back fully and create what you would rather be a part of.

            I'm in the midst of watching this, I'm really glad this is being discussed. I've appreciated much of the information that had come from info wars, it's simple not discussed much elsewhere until it is there, but he does whip people into a frenzy that can be dangerous. I'm not sure if he is controlled opposition but it has been something I have considered. Glen Beck is also very good at doing this. As is most of the stuff on fox. I say that sadly because I am very much right leaning.

             Nobody makes anyone do anything.  People are responsible for their own actions.  They tried to blame rock and roll for violence, they tried to blame movies for violence, they tried to blame video games, they tried to blame smoking weed, etc, etc... It never ends.  It's BS to say anyone but the people who did the bad things were to blame for what they did.
            </p>

             Alex never said go out and kill the police.  He said if you come and try to take our guns then it's on.  Same with the military guy in the video.  He clearly says if they come to take the guns he will stand up for the Constitution which is the law of the land in the USA. Some people wish to follow the laws of the land and others feel like they want to change the laws to further trample on human rights.
            </p>
            <p>
             If watching a person on video talking about the constitution and telling people to not take our guns makes you go out and kill someone then you have serious issues that go far beyond the person in the video.

<p>I wrote this up for <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> on reddit but the implications for the occult/spirituality are immense.</p>
<p>With a change of perspective on modern physics truths, we can unify physics, while simultaneously proving the holographic and fractal nature of the Universe - showing that all matter is recursively entangled with itself - allowing a continually evolving Universe.</p>
<p><strong>Lets think about the basics of how relativity and Einsteins field equations link with quantum mechanics.</strong></p>
<p>Einstein wrote equations to describe how the cubic grid structure of space would behave under the influenece of mass. This is simply a coordinate system that fluxes in response to matter. Imagine cubic lines of force, and imagine what would happen if we introduced mass, and the ensuing contracting that would occur. </p>
<p>We\'ve seen depictions of this like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg">http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/files/2012/07/Curved_in_3D.jpg</a></p>
<p>However, there\'s something thats not immediately obvious. These equations <strong>were only solved when an infinity is introduced</strong> - creating our formal descripion of a black hole. Put simply the black hole is massive or energetic enough for the cubic grid to ultimately become a single point - infinite curvature of space causing \'singularity\'.</p>
<p>What also is curious about this solution to Einstein\'s equations is that <strong>it\'s the equation used to calculate orbitals for planets/suns/etc - even though it predicts a black hole in the center.</strong> It\'s said to be an approximation, but I\'ll tell you why it isn\'t. </p>
<p><strong>Lets jump over to the basics of quantum mechanics.</strong></p>
<p>Quantum field theory states that each and every point in space is filled with field energy, such as the electromagnetic field. Therefore, each and every point in of the field must be divided or quantized into a harmonic oscillator, which is a fancy word that just means an energetic oscillation, which can be envisioned simply as a ball and spring. Think of a fractal sine wave. This is what is being envisioned in the \'quantum field\' - and since each point must be quantized, the smaller the \'piece\' or section of the wave that you quantize, the higer the frequency, the higher the energy. </p>
<p>This leads to a formally infinite energy at each point in space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy">Wiki - Vacuum Energy</a> There is no lower limit on the size of the quanta, thus there is no limit to the amount of energy.</p>
<p>However, Max Planck figured out that our Universe\'s energetic fields appear to work on a smallest quanta of a specific length, the planck length. This is how he (Planck) figured out how much energy photons are putting out from light emitters - which was also giving an infinite energy for ultraviolet radiation. This obviously didn\'t jive. After quantizing the energy into planck length fluctuations of the planck mass energy - so that this light or energy was being sent in planck-cutoff sized packets, he was able to solve the UV catastrophe. </p>
<p>This led physicists to put a \'cutoff size\' of the harmonic oscillator filled quantum field permetaing all space at the planck length - called renormalization - because we now know that the electromagnetic field is made up of planck-sized packets.</p>
<p>However, this <em>still</em> is absurdly more energy than we can directly observe. Using the planck length quantization you are still left with a harmonic oscillation energy of the planck mass which when multiplied by the amount that fit in a cm^3 of vacuum leaves 10^93 grams, orders of magnitude higher than what you would get if you smushed the whole Universe into a cm^3.</p>
<p>This is now said to simply be virtual and unreal - its basically written off.</p>
<p>So we have an infinity in the predicted field energy of the vacuum, and we have an infinite curvature of space solution to relativity that describes all gravitation.</p>
<p>John Wheeler was one of the first to describe a geon, which is pure field energy so massive that it could keep itself together gravitationally, just like the Einstein field equations predict for a black hole surrounding a physical mass. </p>
<p>So all we need is to change our perspective on a few things to knit this together.</p>
<p><strong>Unifying</strong></p>
<p>The vacuum energy of the planck density IS real, space = the quantum vacuum = 10^93 grams/cm^3. The vacuum is a series of overlapping geons, it\'s made of overlapping planck spherical units (PSU) of the planck mass. Each PSU being a spherical oscillation of light whose simple field energy is massive enough to keep it gravitationally together, it\'s a black hole made of light. This black hole is a Kerr-Newman black hole, which gives it certain properties, one being that it could have a spin state of 1 or -1, allowing it to essentially function as a bit of information.</p>
<p>This black hole is the infinity that links QM and relativities infinities.</p>
<p>Space IS the quantum vacuum, and these are not separate, and space is not simply an abstract coordinate system. </p>
<p>Now we have placed a black hole at each and every point in space which is what the Einstein Field equations are showing us as the solution for mass/curvature.</p>
<p>But how can we reconcile the fact that we don\'t clearly see 10^93 grams/cm^3 in empty space? Wouldn\'t that cause all points of space to attract all other points of space?</p>
<p>Well, we have to adopt a specific vacuum geometry, that is - the geometry of these overlapping spherical black holes - which is based on Bucky Fullers work in synergetics. Essentially Bucky knew that energy was going to be quantized spheres - so he imagined how these could pack and what the dynamics of energetic packing would look like.</p>
<p>So as to not get too deep into this part of the theory, just imagine that there exists a method of packing energetic ovarlapping spheres so that outwardly their energy cancelled out, and appear as zero-point - infinite potential, but zero output - a sort of crystalline geometry which seemingly freezes the harmonic oscillation to an outside observer - so space is \'frozen\' in empty space (except for a tiny amount which we see as the cosmological constant/dark energy causing expansion) - THIS is the geometry of a black hole &amp; singularity, NOT an infinte-point-singularity. The reasoning behind this is that all vectors are of equal length, so equal force, so no vectors of force.</p>
<p>The geometry looks like this <a href="http://i.imgur.com/btQaGYo.png">bottom left two</a> - a vector equilibrium/cube-octahedron.</p>
<p>This is what your quantum vacuum fractal harmonic oscillations look like, not as fractal ball-and-spring, but as fractal cube-octahedral jitterbug.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.antiprism.com/album/misc/jit_f10c_sph.gif">http://www.antiprism.com/album/misc/jit_f10c_sph.gif</a></p>
<p>We can look at this jitterbug as one gravity unit. This is what gravity is, a collapse of the space metric. </p>
<p>Because the planck unit in a planck mass is energetic enough to make itself a black hole, it <em>also</em> creates a formal Einstein Rosen bridge, an effect on the Einstein field equations that describe a wormhole that flattens distant coordinates in the space grid to a single point. Simply imagine the coordinate system being pinched together, like a stretched black hole. The conditions that allow this to arise is called a Bose Einstein Condensate.</p>
<p>This means the quantum vacuum and space, being made of PSUs, is connected everywhere pretty much like a hyperdimensional overlay that knits all 3d coordiates into a singularity, put simply - at the Universe\'s most fundamental level, all points in space are touching at length=0 geometrically. </p>
<p><strong>Deriving Mass</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, we have to re-envision matter as a function of this space/quantum vacuum, not as a particle that gets it\'s energy from some higgs field.</p>
<p>So we have described space as a superfluid (Bose Einstein Condensate) of quantized light energy packets, of which fill the entire universe with infinite energy, normally unperceivable but allow an infinite potential of creation at each point, that when \'activated\' by simply having multiple PSUs co-spin or co-orbit (jitterbugging of the aforementioned vector equilibrium) at the speed of light - becomes matter.</p>
<p>Next comes the PSU holographic pixelation solution for the proton, which proves by using these fundamental black hole based units you create an even bigger atomic-sized holographic black hole, which contains enough planck spherical units (and their bit 1/-1  / spin) to encode the information/spin information of all other protons - which use the PSU bose einstein condensate lattice to exchange information.</p>
<p>To calculate the protons holographic mass and standard rest mass is very simple.</p>
<p>When we divide the proton volume by the planck spherical volume (they are overlapping, so you can simply divide one into the other) and multiply by the planck mass, we yield 10^55 grams, which is the currently estimated mass of the observable Universe.</p>
<p>If we then generalize the holographic principle, and apply it - by simply dividing the surface PSU\'s by the volume PSUs &amp; multiply by 2*planck mass, we nail the standard mass of the proton at 10^-24 grams.</p>
<p>However, by using the new (2013) muonic hydrogen proton radius that deviates from about 4% from the standard model\'s prediction, we yield a mass of 1.673349 * 10^-24 grams, which is within .00072*10^-24 grams of CODATA. </p>
<p>This means that we have the only algebraic method of deriving the proton charge radius in existence, and it is within one sigma of the new muonic hydrogen charge radius.</p>
<p>Here we can see that the holographic surface membrane of the proton instantly distributes the majority of the protons mass energy density through the BEC lattice of space, to 10^40 more protons - the amount that isn\'t instantly transferred just so happens to equal the standard rest mass of the proton.</p>
<p>tl;dr; - All protons are entangled with one another through a micro-wormhole structure of space, known as EP=EPR. </p>
<p>Protons are atomic sized black holes in which we can calculate the mass by using the well known holographic principle.</p>',

           If we then generalize the holographic principle, and apply it - by simply dividing the surface PSU's by the volume PSUs &amp; multiply by 2*planck mass, we nail the standard mass of the proton at 10^-24 grams.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, by using the new (2013) muonic hydrogen proton radius that deviates from about 4% from the standard model's prediction, we yield a mass of 1.673349 * 10^-24 grams, which is within .00072*10^-24 grams of CODATA.
          </p>
          <p>
           This means that we have the only algebraic method of deriving the proton charge radius in existence, and it is within one sigma of the new muonic hydrogen charge radius.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here we can see that the holographic surface membrane of the proton instantly distributes the majority of the protons mass energy density through the BEC lattice of space, to 10^40 more protons - the amount that isn't instantly transferred just so happens to equal the standard rest mass of the proton.
          </p>
          <p>
           tl;dr; - All protons are entangled with one another through a micro-wormhole structure of space, known as EP=EPR.
          </p>
          <p>
           Protons are atomic sized black holes in which we can calculate the mass by using the well known holographic principle.

            I keep running around in circles, only one idea sets me back on my path. Through various research I've found that the central and sole path to knowledge is meditation. I applaud the websites on which i 'wasted' my time (reddit pre-2016, voat, 8chan) for reminding me every once in a while that many have come to a conceptual understanding of god or magic but few have sat down to meditate for even a minute.

            Hey OP, I don't intend to denigrate you personally, your thoughtful and well-written post, or to dissuade you from speculating or looking for the truth. In fact, I'd love to encourage you and read more of these ideas here. There needs to be more posts like yours on forums like these.

            But to me it looks like you've fallen for the biggest conspiracy about physics. The last 100 years or so of physics has been teaching students false knowledge about atomism/quantum/relativity bullshit. To modern science, everything in the universe is just a suitcase full of continuously invented particles: photons, electrons, muons, gluons, quarks. Science even has to invent "virtual particles" to try and explain fields and instantaneous action at a distance. Or they have to basically bring back the idea of ether by calling it "quantum fluid" so they can save face.
           </p>
           <p>
            Science can describe many phenomena and we have models that work in many cases, but there's a difference between a description and an actual explanation. My opinion is that physics needs basically a massive reset and you have to go back 
100 years to the original thoughts of people like Tesla, Heaviside, JC Maxwell &amp; CP Steinmetz who gave us basically the entire modern world and start over.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do however believe that there might be something to the idea of something linking physics and (I'd guess many would call it) theology.

             I'm pretty partial to Russellian theory. In a round about way the angry photographer or youtube user 
Theoria Apophasis proves, at least explains the more simplistic aspects of russelian theory through a magnetic lens. If you haven't seen his videos on magnetism watch them all. Its well worth it.

              Definitely. I like his videos a lot and many of my ideas are influenced by Ken Wheeler's discussions on magnetism and physics. If anybody reading this is interested in the subject and hasn't seen some of that guys videos before check them out. There's definitely a lot that he's talked about magnetism and many areas of physics that I don't think modern mainstream science even comes close to explaining.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, the unfortunate thing is that he's not a particularly effective communicator to normal people.

             Yep.
            </p>
            <p>
             13.5 Questioner: Thank you. Can you tell me of the earliest, first known thing in the creation?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ra: I am Ra. The first known thing in the creation is infinity. The infinity is creation. (Surprise, the quantum vacuum has a formally infinite energy density that is 'removed' by modern physics)
            </p>
            <p>
             13.6 Questioner: From this infinity then must have come what we experience as creation. What was the next step or the next evolvement?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ra: I am Ra. Infinity became aware. This was the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
             13.7 Questioner: After this, what happened?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ra: Awareness led to the focus of infinity into infinite energy. You have called this by various vibrational sound complexes, the most common to your ears being “Logos” or “Love.” The Creator is the focusing of infinity as an aware or conscious principle called by us as closely as we can create understanding/learning in your language, intelligent infinity.
            </p>
            <p>
             13.8 Questioner: Can you state the next step?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ra: The next step is still at this space/time nexus in your illusion achieving its progression as you may see it in your illusion. The next step is an infinite reaction to the creative principle following the Law of One in one of its primal distortions, freedom of will. Thus many, many dimensions, infinite in number, are possible.
             <strong>
              The energy moves from the intelligent infinity due first to the outpouring of randomized creative force, this then creating patterns which in holographic style appear as the entire creation no matter which direction or &gt;energy is explored.
             </strong>
             These patterns of energy begin then to regularize their own local, shall we say, rhythms and fields of energy, thus creating dimensions and universes.

            Here's the problem: if you calculate that the universe is holographic in nature, you still need "dark matter" to account for the fact that you can only observe 0.1x as much matter as is needed to produce our universe's behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            The holographic principle is the "old and busted" in this area. This theory suggests that information is held in spacetime itself, and the "weight" of that information provides the force usually ascribed to "something real that we just totally can't observe"--unproved, unobserved "dark matter".
           </p>

           <p>
            So, all in all, you have a nice idea. But your hypothesis still requires that nine-of-ten particles are magic, weakly interacting, hard to observe particles of "dark matter".

             So this isn't my theory by a long shot - it's by a man named Nassim Haramein

             Here's his Ted Talk:

            </p>
            <p>
             However, dark matter is no longer necessary in this view.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because spin (torsion) has been added to the Einstein field equations, you no longer need dark matter to explain the extra rotational behavior of galaxies. Since matter is spinning space, you get a lumineferous aether without violating the Michaelson Morley experiments.

              His theoretical research on the topic of the magnetohydrodynamics of astrological and cosmological plasma phenomena was first published in his 2008 paper (with Elizabeth Rauscher) “Scale Unification: A Universal Scaling Law”. In this paper he and Rauscher elucidate a beautiful universal scaling law that shows how fractal self-similarity is found at all scales of spinning structures in the universe, and explain, “In a spacetime which incorporates a source of angular momentum in the stress energy tensor … galactic structures … may be best described by magnetohydrodynamics driven by the structure of spacetime itself.” He and Rauscher then explore cosmological magnetohydrodynamics with deeper mathematical rigor in the paper “Collective Coherent Oscillation Plasma Modes in Surrounding Media of Black Holes and Vacuum Structure – Quantum Processes with Considerations of Spacetime Torque and Coriolis Forces” (2010).
              <strong>
               Here they find that the inclusion of torque and Coriolis in Einstein’s field equations is sufficient to explain the motion of large cosmological scale structures such as galaxies and galactic clusters, showing that it is unnecessary to resort to some new theoretical particle (such as the putative WIMPs).

              I'm using the term "magic particle" to refer to the unsatisfying definition of dark matter as "weakly interacting massive particles", meaning they only interact insofar as they exert gravitational pull.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't see how your hypothesis can get around that issue. Can you explain to me how standard relativity requires dark matter--and can achieve a holographic universe where all information is encoded on the "skin" of spacetime--but this hypothesis you've made has both a holographic aspect, but also predicts the universe's current behavior without a "free variable" to account for 90% of the needed mass being missing?
             </p>
             <p>
              Specifically, this hypothesis I linked to in my earlier comment explains that extra gravitation by asserting that dark matter is not real, and that we can explain the universe's behavior best if the universe is not, in fact, holographic in nature.

                 The very important, quantum gravity paper is here

            i think we are re-learning the secrets that were already known by many ancient civilizations before us
           </p>
           <p>
            i find it interesting that it's being revealed in the field of quantum science - the stuff that's going on in this field is literally mind-blowing
           </p>
           <p>
            alchemy will again be an accepted science at some point

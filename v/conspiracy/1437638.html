<p>The &quot;Spiritual Teacher&quot; Teal Swan is the head of a cult-like social group that has been stricken with controversy. The group caters specifically to REAL VICTIMS OF SATANIC RITUAL ABUSE, along with enlightenment seekers and people interested in spirituality, Law of Attraction, and/or Satanic Ritual Abuse.</p>
<p>She has been accused of plagiarism:
<a href="http://www.celestialhealing.com/2015/11/fullmetal-plagiarist.html?m=1">http://www.celestialhealing.com/2015/11/fullmetal-plagiarist.html?m=1</a></p>
<p>Here is a painting she plagiarised (SATANIC SYMBOLISM)
<a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE1Z-W982yt9f4Js3pGTV-rljO3VS3SBX77PNeqMagO5z7y2lE1A">https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE1Z-W982yt9f4Js3pGTV-rljO3VS3SBX77PNeqMagO5z7y2lE1A</a></p>
<p>Teal Swan has a team of &quot;haters&quot; who have sprayed the web and youtube with trash on her. Some of it seems to be intentional false flags to discredit her dissenters. Some of it it is legit. Some of it seems like a &quot;capture&quot; for people waking up. I explain that later.</p>
<p>She claims to be a SRA victim herself and she may well be. However, she encourages a &quot;healing&quot; technique that is dangerous and potentially fatal. In her new book &quot;The Completion Process&quot; (which was stolen from two seperate sources and merged together with twists, of course.) encourages people to relive thier trauma repeatedly and for long durations of time.</p>
<p>I believe some suicides have been attributed to Teal Swan\'s teachings, but I can only know of one verifyable example, but I believe there are more. Here is more info on Teal\'s encouragement of suicide: <a href="http://www.celestialhealing.com/2015/05/shadows-before-suicide.html?m=1">http://www.celestialhealing.com/2015/05/shadows-before-suicide.html?m=1</a> </p>
<p>Here\'s where things get more strange, it screams of conspiracy, and it\'s not the end of it by far.</p>
<p>Several weeks before the US election Teal Swan posted a blog called &quot;A Clear Directive&quot;. In the blog she warned of impending doom after the election. She warned of a hitler-like candidate being funded by a world-wide evil man, and she encouraged everyone to vote for the &quot;wild card&quot;. </p>
<p>Nothing strange so far...
It was obvious to me that Hillary was hitler and Trump was the &quot;wild card&quot;. Around this time she had started talking about &quot;visions&quot; of a &quot;forest fire&quot; aka apocalypse on podcasts.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Fast forward to NOW, after the election of Trump&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>She has recently come out and stated that &quot;America got it wrong!! We are dead-meat because America voted for the forest fire!!&quot; here is a video of her brainwashing people and bashing Trump <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1TvGK5zpZP4">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1TvGK5zpZP4</a></p>
<p>She has since DELETED her &quot;Clear Directive&quot; blog encoraging people to vote for the non-hitler candidate. The blog is still viewable on Google cache or some shit.</p>
<p>I believe she expected Hillary to win, and she would become a god among survivors of WW3. She knew it was coming.</p>
<p>Important note: she also encourages &quot;intentional communities&quot; to be set up within her fan base. It makes sense to keep her fans in fear of death because she has more control and can group them in &quot;safe&quot; intentional communities.</p>
<p>Here we have a group of people, many thinking that they are part of a movement against SRA simply because the leader is supposedly a victim.
Which means...
- Fans tend to defend her
BECAUSE
- There is a &quot;Satanic Cult out to silence her&quot;
- They are on the &quot;right team&quot;</p>
<p>What a mess...</p>
<p>A deeper conspiracy comes here: Some might not believe her, so they THEN run to her &quot;opposition&quot;, not a satanic cult, but her ex-husband, Sarbdeep Swan, who seems to denounce the legitimacy of the resurfacing of repressed memories of satanic abuse. <a href="http://sarbswan.com/">http://sarbswan.com/</a></p>
<p>Im not 100% sure, but this is looks like mind games. Brainwashing on both ends. Again, Sarbdeep may have good intentions.I don\'t know.</p>
<p>It goes deeper. The group she STOLE the name &quot;Completion Process&quot; from, the Natyananda group, was involved in a sex scandal. The scandal is not widely known because it was dismissed by law enforcement. You be the judge <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nityananda_sex_scandal">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nityananda_sex_scandal</a></p>
<p>My thinking is this: people (even victims) waking up to Teal\'s BS might find themselves A) devoted Natyananda followers because they are the original &quot;Completion Process&quot; practitioners, or B) rejecting of repressed memories of abuse because of Sarbdeep. Here is a video about how Teal Swan stole Nityananda material <a href="https://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=428rVAwPj-A">https://m.youtube.com/?#/watch?v=428rVAwPj-A</a></p>
<p>I apologize if this is scrambled up and confusing. Its hard to depict a conspiracy that is this deep and not so widely known. If you\'re interested in further investigation, there is plenty to investigate.</p>
<p>I believe the Teal Swan conspiracy is real and these SRA victims need help. If I were a hacker I would investigate what\'s happening behind the scenes... But I am utterly clueless about IT.</p>
<p>Here is her forum <a href="https://tealswan.com/forums">https://tealswan.com/forums</a></p>
<p>Can anyone help figure out what is going on? I care about these people.</p>',

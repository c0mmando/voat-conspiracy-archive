            ...but this is an obvious example of cognitive dissonance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The author, Kennan, is saying that to stop these nations from taking over the world, the US must bascially be first to take over the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or to put it another way; because Russia and China are 'hostile', the US must also be hostile in its foreign policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another point is it's also very easy to transpose the US into the same position as USSR in this essay - taking the penultimate paragraph and replacing the USSR with USA we see;

            Thanks for the info, which was new to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is China hostile? I don't think so. It's greedy, thuggish, and most of all -- DUMB. They don't like other people enough to dominate them. As Kennan wrote, though, they are insecure both politically and culturally. People are not as homogenized as they believe and their ties to the professed culture are weak.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Communism was born from a position of insecurity, manipulation and constant dissatisfaction. This fit with Russia but ideology is a hard-sell in China. Particularly
            <em>
             foreign
            </em>
            ideology. What persists today is not very Communist.
           </p>
           <p>
            China will accept any settlement that means they have no responsibility to others and which makes them richer. They're looters, at this point. They don't have an image of authority to protect.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way to defeat China? Stop buying their crap
            <em>
             or
            </em>
            race to the bottom in currency devaluation. Their internal commitments and 4-2-1 families are eating their base. China cyclically tears itself apart and reforms. This is part of why ties to past cultures are so weak. When I've asked if China may do this again, Chinese people have told me "No, we decided not to do that in the 90s." So much for the long view of history. Whereas America fails on long-term commitments first and short-term commitments keep getting "kicked down the road," trouble will arise when China fails at mid-range commitments (pensions, etc.). They're already notorious for failing in the short term (wages, etc.) Just wait: they'll collapse. To hasten it, I'd try to enlist everyone else's aid: I can't think of an Asian country that has any respect for China. Not even Vietnam or the Koreas.

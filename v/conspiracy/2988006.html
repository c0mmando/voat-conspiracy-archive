            I think so too. And also those two anonymous leakers of the Buzzfeed debacle, and the hordes of migrants heading to the U.S. border, possibly Occasional Cortex too.

            A well planned psyop will have both 'controlled' and uncontrolled elements.
You just set conditions and hope for the desired results.
Conditions:  "LINCOLN" High School      Ha Ha.....Get it?  They like inside jokes.
"the Colonels" confronted conveniently by the Black Israelites and a Cigar Store Indian.
Get your hats on......
Cameras ready...............and..................ACTION......

Okay now, can I get you guys to do your best "Tomahawk" dance?"

            Trump is controlled opposition. Trump hasn't even released intel that the people should know. The midterms have long passed already. If Trump was going to do anything he would have already started.

            If the media shows you something you can be certain they have something to gain by doing so and are at least distorting the truth. I don't know the exact motivations of the media in every single occurrence, but you can be sure they're not on your side.

            Maybe they just wanted to drag out the Native American card to remind people they exist to use it again later. I'm pretty sure they're controlled and not a real culture because their language is fake.

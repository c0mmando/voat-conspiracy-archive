<p>A simple concept read with rhythm.</p>
<p>A=a. the two symbols may look different yet they bring about the same cognitive result. Let’s say that we also have the equation 1=1. What would happen if we decided to say that a=1+1 and A=1. Once again they look aesthetically pleasing yet we know that this is not correct. Or is it. What are we actually seeing here? This is duality. </p>
<p>It is the combination of words and symbol to create a new type of meaning. This is simple yet powerful. It is the combination of calculated thought along with the understanding of the surroundings you yourself are in. not me being the writer, rather you being the reader in combination with me as the writer. As the writer I cannot simply give you my words to express what I wish to tell you but instead I must write the words in your mind of what you wish to see. This is the concept of duality. There is duality in all things it is the “dark vs light”, the contrast in everyday life. It keeps us moving. So this we see very clearly as the 1+1=2 we take two points connect them and try to solve a solution. A very in the box idea. One way in one way out. This kind of thinking can ben entrapping. It ranges across all. The double slit experiment is fundamentally what all life is based on. Overlapping waves.</p>
<p>We consist of atoms which have a nucleus to shell ratio that is equivalent to that of a marble in a professional baseball field, which at first glance seems impossible. Mankind stood together to solve the answer. We fight to solve problems yet they only seem to bring more problems. Which is the problem of today? Is it the money problem, the consumption problem in the food industry, the misbalance problem in economics? This seems like a 1+1 = 2 idea. Let us take another look. Perhaps I see opportunity in the food industry as they are making a movement to feed the world. Perhaps I see that the economy keeping an old trustworthy machine working when a new one may need to be put in place. Perhaps I see that maybe this old rusty machine is the balance because it itself has duality. Just as you the reader create this duality. So let’s get a little deeper in to the idea of waves. </p>
<p>They are continuous, in other words they have no break points. Starting from a primary wave pulsations, or contrast in energy, we can see this in light vs dark. What happens when we see dark as light and light as light? So the glass is half full right now is probably what you may be thinking? But this is not the full message. If I ignore that the glass is half full it cannot be half empty? What if I know that the glass is both full and empty in equal amounts? Well this isn’t a 1+1=2 is it? As a matter of fact it seems to be a 1+1= 3 situation a trinity. Let us go back to standing waves now but instead two primary waves independently operating. Alright well since there is such a thing a duality and I can choose to see things as they are or as I wish to prescribe. When they are seen as they are with honesty and integrity to self, one might get the feeling as there is something in there heart that may show guidance but when we detach from the idea of self-worth and gratitude we see the opposite result. There are always two sides to every equation and even still there are inverses of the equations. We spend our time building so much that maybe we forget to see all that we have. This is in a sense a movement proposal but more than anything I wish to inspire a new way of viewing the self as well as others.</p>
<p>I am just as real to you sending you this message as you are to me reading this message.  What if the idea of exchange was similar to this. For am I not you and you not I. well in actuality that depends how you want to look at things. I like explore the idea that you are you and I  am I but together we create us and without you I cannot be “here”. Why such a view one might ask? Well on the small scale believe that anyone action can influence a single given complex result but only if the receiver is present. Even along the idea of text there seems to be a duality in the sound aligning with the meaning, the true meanings. The things that we cannot deny. If I had one single butterfly and it flapped its wings  we don’t think much of it. What happens if there is a butterfly that contains the power of all the winds in the universe? I would think that would be one powerful butterfly maybe even a little to powerful for his own good, whether or not his intensions are good. So what if this power was simply distributed amongst all of us? Would you believe this? Can you believe this? Do you believe this? All questions the self can anwer.so what do I myself as the sender of the message try to tell you. Not that I myself can come up with a new way building a better world but instead that simple communication can allow us to see that the glass is always half full and half empty that this itself if the propagating force. When this is used with simple communication, reader to sender commination, perhaps this is known as coincidence. Say that word to yourself and find the phonetic meaning in it. It reads something like co-in-side-us doesn’t it, but of course only if you allow yourself to see it in this way. Now as the messenger I see a world where we are operating on different frequencies as human being. The glass isn’t half full or half empty it is in fact filled with opportunity. Everything that we consist of is waves I can only imagine that these waves of contrast define us both mentally and physically when both are in balance. So where do I see balance. I see balance in exploring the unknown, in looking at fear and realizing that it is all a simple misunderstanding of self-organization. In a sense maybe we’ve been scared to explore and therefore we haven’t. I see a sun that generates enough energy to provide to the roots of all the trees I see before but alone it cannot do it all. For if there was no tilt on the axis there could not be weather. Weather seems to me to be just another “sine” wave doesn’t it? Wait was that you or me speaking? Perhaps both. I see self-contained vortexes that emit from black holes that seem to suck up all the light I can see. Balance. I see the moon right at night and the sun in the day every night. Balance. I see sun giving just enough energy to keep this world from breaking itself down yet enough to standing. Balance. I see men with their backs turned to each other in the world that “we” can create. i see imbalance. I can only hope that this may help the live of one person maybe more. I do know if this message inspires one person, one inventor, one economist, one human being I will be satisfied for it shows me I have made an effort. Let this be the wings of the weakest butterfly. </p>',

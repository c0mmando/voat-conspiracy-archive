             Almost everyone I know has a story to tell about themselves, a friend, a friend’s friend. It’s about the abusiveness of the police in the enforcement of drunk-driving laws. I’ve known people who were quite sure that they were not over the legal limit but suddenly found themselves cuffed in the back of the police car.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            a cop can hold you even if under the limit if he feels you are to impaired to operate a vehicle. criminally there is shit he can do
           </p>

            <p>
             I know a guy who was arrested out of his own driveway

            i knew a guy who was arrested just because he had his car keys on him while walking home. It put him in control of a vehicle. point of story dont keep your keys on you. my motorcycles i always kept the keys in them inside the garage, not anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            besides the portable breathalyzers are not usable in court, its either pass or fail with his investigation. then they give you real one at the station, or urine... and actually urine i think now requires a warrant as it is body fluid
           </p>
           <p>
            also breathalyzers can vary depending when you had last drink. it can read a 0.2 bac off your first drink if you didn't wait long enough. and urine could be higher depending on when you last pissed, i think its called first void. Its kinda why they ask you when was your last drink
           </p>
           <p>
            Blood is really the most accurate, besides they know right away with the nystagmus test. you cant help that one no matter what, and is why they always do it first.
           </p>
           <p>
            and quite honestly, blame implied consent laws, not the cop. you have to prove yourself innocent when on any vehicle. its why you these retarded sovereign citizens get yanked out of their car.

            This is why you should NEVER submit to a breath test (I mean, unless you are actually quite drunk and think you can magically alter your breath). Always request a blood test and refuse a breath test. Best case scenario is you can force the police to have to get a warrant to draw blood, which takes a bit of time, and then they have to drag you to a hospital, which takes a bit of time, and maaaaybe your BAC has dropped enough, or you never had one in the first place, and it's not enough to convict.

             Yeah but if you do a blood or urine test and there’s drugs in your system as well, depending on the state, you just caught got a drug charge and a possible felony depending on the drugs. Happened to my brother

              If you have drugs in your system, mate, then fuck off about driving. I’m speaking about people who may have a BAC, but one that is low enough to not be a statutory DWI. Same with people who

               I don’t do drugs,mate, so there’s no reason for me to rot. I understand your position,I’m just giving a counter example to submitting to a blood test...In my brothers case, someone slipped something into his drink while at a bar one night and he was stopped by the cops walking home... at any rate some states are moving to zero tolerance anyways so if you even have one beer and you’re below .08 your still breaking the law. So the better advice is to use taxis or uber if you’re out drinking at all.

              In my state, it's automatic suspension of your driver's license. However, you can appeal it, and most police will never show up to those hearings, because it's not court.

              Maybe it's worse in your state, but not drawing blood sounds ridiculous. What are they going to do, force an unconscious person from a vehicle collision to forcefully blow into their machine? Normal breathing isn't good enough for the DWI breath tests.

               its pretty much like that everywhere. in minnesota tho you get revoked, pay like 800 dollars to restore it retake the stupid test then its still suspended like 6 months maybe a year i forget. But you can get a work permit to drive to court, hospital, and work... thats it period.
              </p>
              <p>
               the other option is a interlock device, then you have pretty much full access to drive, i did that for like a year, it sucked, but hell i could drive
              </p>
              <p>
               blood draws here i think happen which require a warrant... i think even piss tests too now it was a HUGE deal a few years ago like supreme court level. but to get one is pretty quick
              </p>

               then they would take your blood to test via EMT

               roadside breath tests are not admissible in court anyways, its more ammo for their investigation. I think i mentioned it before its why they give you the The Horizontal Nystagmus Test first because you cant beat that. Plus, breathalyzers you wait a certain amount of time before they become accurate. like if ya have a drink and blow, you'll read crazy high. its why they ask ya when ya had a drink

               the field sobriety is all bullshit fodder... well i shouldn't say that. i mean the police have the right to detain you, tow your car if you are impaired even being under .08 BAC. TBH i cant even do them sober, i actually passed them on my second DUI but i got rung in at .089 no shit. it got dropped to a careless tho, a good lawyer helps
              </p>
              <p>
               anyways this is getting long, really they smell booze on you it is probable cause and really its comes down to your BAC in order for criminal charges
              </p>
              <p>
               sorry i cycle thru alot of accounts, took me a while to see this

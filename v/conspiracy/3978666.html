            That's because aliens are fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was as dumbfounded and surprised and even ashamed and embarrassed at ! myself when I went from a religious background to 25+ years of research trying to not only prove aliens are real but find even a loose fitting general thread which links as many theories and facts and historic events and current events and conspiracies into one mega theory and without realizing it till I took a break from. It all and really looked over my notes and meditated on my thoughts and beliefs did it occur to me that God isnt only real, they are truly trying to hide all the evidence that he in fact is real.
           </p>
           <p>
            Growing up, a friend of mine and I came about a similar theory which we began to use as a 'rule', one I'm sure many goats have thought up of as well, and it's simple, if something, a theory or photo or video or person is not only in the public eye but is being funded and supported and not generally mocked, then what they are trying to "teach" everyone, should be taken with a handful of salt.
           </p>
           <p>
            If aliens were really something real, all the movies wouldn't be made about them or the shows like ancient aliens, would never have been shown on TV, as it's best to just ignore and not add fuel to the fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            A more recent theory we've come about has been the general response and behavior, as in their tone of voice, if they're yelling, if they're threatening you or outright abusing you or trying to "cancel" you, then that idea and thread should be more fully investigated. Something made them fearful at their very core.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at comments on YT and twatter you'll see what I mean. How evil and violent the replies are, when deniers reply to those who simply share a simple photo or share a simple fact, something we all can see or test at home, and yet the "scientific community" has some strange and elaborate explanation for it. That ultimately makes less sense then the logical short and honest explanation many people eventually arrive at if left alone to explain it.
           </p>
           <p>
            My favorite example is the discovery of these small bubbles made by a certain radioactive element within granite, which has a very short half-life. Imagine dropping Alka Seltzer into a glass of water and wishing to freeze the glass so you can freeze in time the bubbles made by the chemical reaction from the Alka Seltzer. That's exactly what happened with granite, it was hardened from a liquid molten state, fast enough to capture the radioactive decay as a bubble, within it, a half life that's a few short minutes! There is really only one way to explain this but deniers will outright ignore this evidence and not even address it. Usually with shrill yelling!

            Saw a mass UFO 'incursion', with about 10,000 other people including police and fire. Some who gave pursuit to monitor. IN 1990's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Main ship was at least a mile in diameter. Lot of other smaller ships, could 'blink' distances. Moved thousands of feet in the blink of an eye to standstill speeds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ex infantry, air assault. I've seen every form of flight man is capable of. It wasn't a 'weather balloon'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not the first mass sighting by a longshot. Go check out washington dc 1964. They buzzed the white house in a display of power. Video of it, color pics. Radar tracks, interceptor confirmation. \

            from 1964.. when the cia had a fleet of flying saucers, huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it really that hard to understand we're not alone in this vast cosmos.

            The WORST thing a civ could do to us is actuALLY make contact: would destroy our society as every other 'explorer' to a new land has done.

             This happened to someone I knew back in the day in NJ.  It was a huge event when a ship flew over the garden state parkway.  I think it was the GSP anyway.  Although I don't think they are from space but rather another dimension.  I have a theory that you can only manipulate dimensions below your own.  We are in the 3rd and can only do things in the 3rd, 2nd and 1st dimensions.  These beings may be from a fourth dimension where they can manipulate time and space.  To us it looks like they are "flying" in ways we never could but in reality they are warping time/space to "move" around. It seems more likely to me that this is what's going on rather than beings coming from outer space.  Everyone has seen some form of a whacky unexplained phenomenon such as ghosts, shadows, UFOs, etc.  What if these things were real and you just happen to be closer to that 4th dimension when you see these things? Just a thought.

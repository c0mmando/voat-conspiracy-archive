            Doesn't mean encryption will end, but it will have to change - i.e. devices that are proprietary data (encrypted)

            Maybe in draconian countries, but still not world wide. There is nothing that can stop a VPN.

            This may also help their bottom line in the long run as it can force content owners to open their legalese to include a wider audience. This isn't 100% Netflix, this is likely a result of shitty content owners (like HBO not allowing a show on Netflix to play in the USA but allowing it in the UK because it plays in the USA and they'd rather get the income than allow Netflix to get it).

            Dude/dudette, where the fuck have you been?! FB already got lots of heat because they were using persistent cookies to track users across the web, as well as across tabs (which, arguably, are the same). I don't remember if there was a lawsuit or anything, but I know it was publicized. If you like privacy, ditch your Apple product and leave FB alone!

            The UN is a governing body for those that signed into it, and even then most of the laws they pass are unenforceable in places like the USA - mostly because our Constitution disallows entering into agreements that directly contradict it, like UN/EU gun control for example.

            The internet is far from dead. Controlled and monitored? Absolutely. But not dead.

Who hurled themselves into the ocean
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold

Let 'em all go
Let it all go

I wanna sing one for the cars
That are right now headed silent down the highway
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
And something has got to give..

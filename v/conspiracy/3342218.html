            Conditioning parents to accept authority-directed mutilation of their babies helps to maintain the cycle of violence. And it is likely that this lie (that circumcision confers sufficient benefits to excuse its violent nature) has prepared the way for today's parents to allow their children to be injected with foreign substances despite documented hazards. Parents minds are already pwned.

             BAD POST. THE QUESTION IS WHY DID JEWS START IT.
            </p>
            <p>
             it's like why did they start sacrificing animals at the temple? because the jewish priests were playing the people to get free food.

               he says it was started to damage jewish people's sexuality. I think he is right however it is one of those things that has a few different reasons. besides that also:
              </p>
              <p>
               would mark people in the cult
              </p>
              <p>
               and more importantly:
              </p>
              <p>
               that foreskin specifically of a baby was shown to have healing properties, this is similar to stem cells and how after an abortion is done the doctors sell the body parts, all of the parts of a baby has healing properties, this may sound crazy but it is scientific fact

                 no it's like how just cuz there are technically benefits to a thing it doesn't mean we should devolve into savages and do whatever. Like should we allow abortions just because the baby body parts can be used by doctors to heal rich people, no.

              Because God instructed Abraham to start the tradition. Abraham is the Paternal father of all Joose. It's truly a Jooish thing to turn your back on Gods laws and yet claim to be his chosen people. As a Christian we live in the understanding that Gods grace was shifted from the Joose to the Gentiles after the Joose killed their Messiah. This seems very historically plausible when you study the expansion of Christianity over the next thousand years, and the fact that the joose were dispersed throughout the world with no nation of their own. Prophesy must come to pass, and it seems as though it has been. After 2000 years or so Israel is back and as prophesied, they deny Gods will and continue to be perverted. But just wait until their true judgement comes. It will be epic, truly epic. Christians have been waiting patiently and watching. We Understand things will get very bad  right before they get straightened out again. (there are still some old testament prophesies that have not come to pass yet). I hope I have some popcorn handy for that show.

                You say Abraham never existed. What ? Were you there? You weren't there. Now that that is settled. Lets go back to using historical references that have not been disproved yet. As it was written, Abraham was ordered by god to mark those who would inherit his blessing, and all who were to worship were to be circumcised. This is a Jewish tradition and was carried over by the Catholics into Christianity. It is not necessary in Christianity to be circumcised.

                  So you don't believe that Jesus existed, even when a  historian documented the whole affair? Josephus was his name, and writing the days events was his game. Your a loser for not opening your eyes to even notice the truth. You might want to do some light reading if you're up to something above "goosebumps" reading level. There is more to life than you understand.

                   no history documented stuff on jesus but tons of messiah claimants were around back then and he was probably a zealot and had a brother named james who was the real main historical figure, similar to ancient astronauts, when they were creating Christianity out of judaism and the roman religions in the second century ad they went back on historical figures and said they were part of the mythical religion. they did find an ossuary with jesus bones (with marys) but that doesn;t necessarily prove it was him, jesus was a common name then.

                    You have not studied, then how is it that you expect to understand anything? Objective Roman citizens recorded things then. There are multiple accounts of the same thing.  We only have one reference for Abraham and his story, we must accept this as at least plausible, having a shortfall of nonsupporting evidence.

                    <p>
                     you may have seen where it is said something like "all main stream historians agree jesus existed" They never say based on what evidence tho. It is because they are religious and/or don't want to upset Christians. It is a controversial topic. Most main stream historians due agree other figures like moses or abraham didn't exist, that is less controversial.  For obvious reasons.

                          Go re read and note that that is the best evidence we have, other than the original Roman Stuff which the Catholic church still controls. The story is at least in some part corroborated. The Roman Empire with all of it's documentation transformed into the Holy Roman Empire around 300 AD. But none the less, Don't bugger me about your lack of faith. You'll have to find a purpose in life on your own.

             skin grafting, they wouldn't have had the technology to do thousands of years ago I assume. just grinding it into a cream and putting on a face I can see easily being done tho. Always wondered why they started this fucked up ritual.

              Not sure why it started, but both Jews and Muslims require circumcised for boys.  Muslims for both boys and girls.  It's a rite of passage in some primitive tribes in pacific islands.  It was recommended by "doctors" in the 19th century as a "cure" for habitual masturbation, as if removal of the foreskin would stop kids from masturbating. LOL.  I was a habitual masturbator as a kid, but cut back to only 4 or 5 times a day in my early adult life.  YMMV.

               recommended by (((doctors))), still why though. obviously not cuz a magical god asked for it. some theories say it makes men masturbate less. some say it's to make men cum quicker so women don't get to cum. I think this is another possibility, maybe some caveman figured out at some point that it makes skin look more youthful. Or maybe just thought it did, either way. Like the chinese eating tiger penises or elephant tusks thinking it makes you more virile or whatever.

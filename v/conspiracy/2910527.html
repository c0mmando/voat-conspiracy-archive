Once you\'ve educated yourself on these techniques, you will quickly be able to spot these fools.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ad hominem: attacking opponents rather than opponents’ ideas or principles</li>
<li>Ad nauseam: repeating ideas relentlessly so that the audience becomes inured to them</li>

<li>Appeal to fear: exploitation of audience anxieties or concerns</li>
<li>Appeal to prejudice: exploitation of an audience’s desire to believe that it is virtuous or morally or otherwise superior</li>
<li>Bandwagon: exploitation of an audience’s desire to conform by encouraging adherence to or acceptance of idea that is supposedly garnering widespread or universal support</li>
<li>Beautiful people: depiction of attractive famous people or happy people to associate success or happiness with adherence to an idea or cause or purchase of a product</li>
<li>Black-and-white fallacy: presentation of only two alternatives, one of which is identified as undesirable</li>
<li>Classical conditioning: association of an idea with another stimulus</li>
<li>Cognitive dissonance: using a favorable stimulus to prompt acceptance of an unfavorable one, or producing an unfavorable association</li>
<li>Common man: adoption of mannerisms and/or communication of principles that suggest affinity with the average person</li>

<li>Disinformation: creating false accounts or records, or altering or removing existing ones, to engender support for or opposition to an idea or cause</li>
<li>Door in the face: seeking compliance with a request by initially requesting a greater commitment and then characterizing the desired outcome as a compromise or a minor inconvenience</li>
<li>Euphoria: generating happiness or high morale by staging a celebration or other motivating event or offer</li>
<li>Fear, uncertainty, and doubt: disseminating false or negative information to undermine adherence to an undesirable belief or opinion</li>
<li>Flag waving: appealing to nationalism or patriotism</li>
<li>Foot in the door: manipulation by encouraging a small gift or sacrifice, which establishes a bond that can be exploited to extract more significant compliance</li>
<li>Glittering generalities: applying emotionally appealing but vague and meaningless words to an idea or cause</li>
<li>Half-truth: making a statement that is partly true or only part of the truth, or is otherwise deceptive</li>
<li>Inevitable victory: assurance of uncommitted audience members and reassurance of committed audience members that an idea or cause will prevail</li>
<li>Join the crowd: communication intended to persuade the audience to support an idea or cause because it is or will be the dominant paradigm</li>
<li>Labeling or name-calling: using euphemistic or dysphemistic terms to encourage a positive or negative perception of a person, an idea, or a cause</li>
<li>Latitudes of acceptance: introducing an extreme point of view to encourage acceptance of a more moderate stance, or establishing a barely moderate stance and gradually shifting to an extreme position</li>
<li>The lie: false or distorted information that justifies an action or a belief and/or encourages acceptance of it</li>
<li>Love bombing: isolation of the target audience from general society within an insular group that devotes attention and affection to the target audience to encourage adherence to an idea or cause</li>
<li>Managing the news: influencing news media by timing messages to one’s advantage, reinterpreting controversial or unpopular actions or statements (also called spinning), or repeating insubstantial or inconsequential statements that ignore a problem (also called staying on message)</li>
<li>Milieu control: using peer or social pressure to engender adherence to an idea or cause; related to brainwashing and mind control</li>
<li>Obfuscation: communication that is vague and ambiguous, intended to confuse the audience as it seeks to interpret the message, or to use incomprehensibility to exclude a wider audience</li>
<li>Operant conditioning: indoctrination by presentation of attractive people expressing opinions or buying products</li>
<li>Oversimplification: offering generalities in response to complex questions</li>

<li>Repetition: repeated use of a word, phrase, statement, or image to influence the audience</li>
<li>Scapegoating: blaming a person or a group for a problem so that those responsible for it are assuaged of guilt and/or to distract the audience from the problem itself and the need to fix it</li>
<li>Selective truth: restrictive use of data or facts to sway opinion that might not be swayed if all the data or facts were given</li>
<li>Sloganeering: use of brief, memorable phrases to encapsulate arguments or opinions on an emotional rather than a logical level</li>
<li>Stereotyping: incitement of prejudice by reducing a target group, such as a segment of society or people adhering to a certain religion, to a set of undesirable traits</li>
<li>Straw man: misrepresentation or distortion of an undesirable argument or opinion, or misidentifying an undesirable persona or an undesirable single person as representative of that belief, or oversimplifying the belief</li>
<li>Testimonial: publicizing of a statement by an expert, authority figure, or celebrity in support of an idea, cause, or product in order to prompt the audience to identify with the person and support the idea or cause or buy the product</li>
<li>Third party: use of a supposedly impartial person or group, such as a journalist or an expert, or a group falsely represented as a grassroots organization, to support an idea or cause or recommend a product</li>

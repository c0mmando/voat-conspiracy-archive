            I think we'd all like more details on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been a ton revealed in recent weeks of securas and palantir based ongoing operations, full time use of the communication grid to harass those people and locations determined to have the conditions of precrime.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of Nicholas Cruz, do you think this Republic of Florida and the corruption of the local police department have anything to do with the 'hacking' of the system?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the main issue I keep trying to tell people, you think when the police or fbi or nsa get a surveillance/control tool that only these top notch morally incorruptible loyal americans are going to get to use it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But no, like michael cohen demonstrates, there is a cash and carry policy on every aspect of american government, military and law enforcement.
           </p>
           <p>
            And these tools are not such that once someone uses them they ever again be restricted, no, these nationala and private services are using their access to copy/paste everything on anyone.  For them it's cheap, and they use it to make money confiscating people's things, like silk road and alphabay.  Then they replace whatever threatening versions of tech or society with compromised versions staffed by flunkies, then spam the space with automated fakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you check my work at steemit.com/@mindhawk or reddit.com/u/mindhawk or
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/theriseofmindhawk">

            , I get into a lot of this stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            I write this because I personally believe while I travelled in the United States last year I was followed by police at nearly ever public location I visited over several months.
           </p>
           <p>
            I confirmed also I am not on the Thompson-reuters list of risky people and was able to freely travel, although encountering still obvious surveillance en route and where I am now in a completely different country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have documented a lot of it on steemit, hoping a blockchain will make it difficult to erase forever if I disappear.

            <p>
             Here is what I can piece together from publicly available sources. NYC under Guiliani developed the first tracking software for police to use against criminals. The FBI took that same software and developed it into VICAP so they could track crimes in uniform crime reports.
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI exported VICAP to Canada where they fastidiously do data entry. VICAP is capable of getting crime details and spitting out a shortlist of suspects. This is again the publicly available information.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beyond that, I think Stallman was right that an end-user can be programmed through repetetive use of a computer program that they have no control over. If it forces them to see the public in binary terms; everyone is a threat or benign they will react that accordingly. Its gonna be a feedback loop for the officers and criminals though as repeated interactions with make both groups increasingly hostile to one another.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now here is the big conspiracy portion. The Canadians improved on VICAP and defined parameters for everyone to see how many ticking timebombs exist and they track them. In the U.S. where cops are too lazy for a little bit of data entry we are not aware of who those individuals are. If you are aware of Arthur Gouzenko and the history of spycraft in Canada you know that Russians have found how the Canadian VICAP works. They are using the parameters that define ticking timebombs and systematically contacting them in the U.S. and talking them into mass shootings. For them its a low cost high return way of antagonizing us and we cant stop them. The internet cant be turned off. Even with a very low success rate its still worthwile for them to set people off.

             So I hadn't heard of the Thompson-Reuters list and did a quick search. Poked around their site to try to understand what exactly they do. Seems like they offer information to employers taking a look at potential candidates? Or am I wrong there? Because if so, I thought that's what a criminal background check is for. What other info do these guys keep that businesses would "need" to know.

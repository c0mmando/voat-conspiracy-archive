They have unlimited resources at their disposal and many powerful nations that are nothing more than mere puppets for them to use, they can easily dispose of Assad anytime they want to. We saw how easy it was for the U.S to bring down one leader after another during the phony Cold War, we saw how easy it was for them to take down Saddam and Gaddafi, so why is Assad an exception to this rule? </p>
<p>I looked into the history the Assad family and came across a lot of interesting information and the answer to that question is quite simple and it has nothing to with Assad rhyming with Mossad.  
</p>
<p>Is Assad a crypto? </p>
<p>Quite possibly.  Looking at the family tree of Assad, there are many crypto indications. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Sulayman-al-Assad/6000000019763411583">https://www.geni.com/people/Sulayman-al-Assad/6000000019763411583</a>  
</p>
<p>This is the great-grandfather of Bashar Al-Assad, this is where his family tree begins. As you can see, information about him is very limited. </p>
<p>There is no information on when he is born, where he is born, who his parents were. There is zero information about his origins. Even his real last name is unknown.</p>
<p>\'\'One version says that Sulayman, great-grandfather of current president Bashar al-Assad, had been given the name al-Wahhish, or &quot;the wild beast&quot;, because of his exploits while waging war on the Ottomans. This had negative connotations, though - so Sulayman swapped al-Wahhish for al-Assad &quot;the lion&quot;.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://archive.ph/ln2Db#selection-1721.0-1721.299">https://archive.ph/ln2Db#selection-1721.0-1721.299</a> </p>
<p>His last name given in his family tree is nothing more than a nickname given to him that he had adapted and it meant \'wild beast\' but then later  the family changed the name to Assad, meaning lion. So not only is his last name unknown, but here we see multiple surname changes associated with predatory animals. Jews are known for that, specifically names for lion. When Jacob blessed his sons, he compared several of them to animals, Judah was likened to a lion. This is why the name Leon (greek for Lion) is popular amongst jews.</p>
<p>Also notice how his great-grandfather was fighting against the Ottomans, the jews at this time were also trying to bring down the Ottoman Empire so that they can free Palestine of their control. </p>
<p>Here is further crypto indications; </p>
<p>Bashar Al-Assads grandfather, the son of Sulayman al-Wahhish,  Ali Sulayman al-Assad was sympathetic to the cause of Zionism, suprise of all suprises..</p>
<p>Here is an excerpt of a letter that was sent to the jewish prime minister of France, Leon Blum. One of the signature of this letter was that of Assads grandfather. </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.ph/9Vr7G">https://archive.ph/9Vr7G</a></p>
<p>Also there is ZERO information about who Bashar Assads great-grandmother was. Her identity is completely hidden. Why has an effort been made to hide her identity completely? Further crypto indications. </p>
<p>Now we get to the good stuff, Assads father, Hafez Al-Assad. As it turns out, this piece of shit was a major traitor to Syria and a huge phony, only pretending to be opposed to Israel on the surface while kissing their ass behind the scenes by assisting them in their goal of achieving Greater Israel. </p>
<p>Hafez Al-Assad was the one who ultimately became the dictator of Syria through a coup. But, how did he manage to achieve such a feat? Coups during the Cold War, specially in the Arab world was assisted by the CIA. In just 5 years, he managed to go from Air Force Commander to the ultimate leader of Syria, such a feat is usually only possible with the help of outsider. But what did he exactly do to recieve such assistence? </p>
<p>When Hafez Al-Assad was the Air Force Commander of the Syrian army he had travelled to London in 1965 (proof; <a href="https://archive.ph/kBZFT">https://archive.ph/kBZFT</a> ) and there is strong suspicion that he had met with Israeli officials there were they set up a deal in which Assad would be heavily rewarded if he fulfilled this deal. It will became more clear why this suspicion exists.</p>
<p>In 1966, just one year after his meeting in London, he suddenly becomes the Defence Minister of Syria and is handed the control of all Syrias army and the first thing he does is remove around 400 officers from the army, heavily crippling the Syrian army. The next year, ‘coincidentally’ you have the Six Day War in which Israel made the first strike. In this war, the Israelis advanced into the Golan Heights were they face very little resistence from the Syrians which allowed the Israelis to keep advancing forward. </p>
<p>The Syrians never counter attacked, not even once. What the Syrians did instead was that they retreated en masse, destroying their own anti-aircraft guns. By the time Israeli army groups had united in a pincer movement on the plateau, all they saw was empty territory because the Syrians had retreated before the Israelis had even approached them! The Syrians had blown up their own bunkers, burning documents and kept retreating, while retreating the Syrians had abondened their own equipment, including tanks, in perfect working condition for the Israelis to take.</p>
<p>Israelis kept coming into one territory after another in the Golan Heights facing no Syrian troops because they all had retreated, only several Syrian soldiers had stayed in their position.</p>
<p>So Israel was basically given the Golan Heights without any fight from Syrias army and who was in charge of Syrias army at this time? No other then Assads father. What was his reward, well he became the ultimate dictator in Syria in 1971 through a coup. That was his reward. </p>
<p>According to assassinated Egyptian president Sadats close friend; Israel bought Golan from Assad; <a href="https://archive.ph/bYOc5">https://archive.ph/bYOc5</a> </p>
<p>In 1973, you had the Yom Kippur War, and in this war Hafez Al-Assad tried to fool the Syrian public and the Syrian army into thinking he was seriously opposed to Israel by having his army trying to retake the Golan Heights but his real aim here was to give Israel more of the Golan Heights. First the Syrian army going into the Golan Heights faced much resistance but because of the sheer numbers of Syrian tanks, they still managed to advance forward and managed to surround the remaining Israeli defence in the Golan Heights, when it looked like the Israeli defence was about to collapse and the Syrians were going to be victorious in regaining the Golan, guess what happens?</p>
<p>The Syrians were all ordered to retreat, they were ordered to retreat when they were close to victory FOR NO REASON AT ALL. So instead this war ended in Israel gaining almost ALL of the Golan Heights, gaining more of the Golan Heights than what they got after the Six Day War, again all thanks to Assads father. </p>
<p>Here is Saddam talking about the 1973 war, not that he is trust worthy himself but what he said was interesting considering the information given above; <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=XI7dZo024mw">https://hooktube.com/watch?v=XI7dZo024mw</a> </p>
<p>On top of giving Israel the Golan Heights, Hafez also removed many of the restrictions put on jews in Syria. He was viewed as a \'Messiah\' by the Syrian jews. </p>
<p>Here is an interesting article about jews in Syria; </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/QkgUr">https://archive.ph/QkgUr</a> </p>
<p>\'\'“For us, of course, he was like the Messiah,” Hasbani said. Before him “you could not walk for four kilometers [without permission]. You could not buy and sell [property]. Walking in the street, you were afraid to say I am a Jew. There were [Jewish] schools. But there was someone from the government sitting on your head, and capable of doing whatever he wanted.”</p>
<p>\'\'Assad, Hasbani said, was different from past Syrian leaders in that he was the first president to truly pay attention to the concerns of Syria’s Jews.</p>
<p>“When we met with him in 1976, people [the Jews] rose,” Hasbani said. “When you sit with the president, people outside would not dare to do anything to you. He who is against you can do nothing to you because he saw the president receiving you and taking pictures with you.”</p>
<p>\'\'When Asad died in 2000, three pro-Likud Jews of Syrian origin – a prominent Syrian-Jewish rabbi named Jack Kassin, Hassidic community leader Jack Avital, and another businessman named Sam Domb – placed an ad in the New York Times offering their condolences, although Domb later complained to The Jewish Week that Kassin had added his name without consent. Kassin was invited to attend the funeral but a Syrian official informed him that his security could not be guaranteed because of threats posed by Asad’s brother and rival Rifat, according to The Jewish Week\'\'</p>

           ) and there is strong suspicion that he had met with Israeli officials there were they set up a deal in which Assad would be heavily rewarded if he fulfilled this deal. It will became more clear why this suspicion exists.

           “When we met with him in 1976, people [the Jews] rose,” Hasbani said. “When you sit with the president, people outside would not dare to do anything to you. He who is against you can do nothing to you because he saw the president receiving you and taking pictures with you.”

           ''When Asad died in 2000, three pro-Likud Jews of Syrian origin – a prominent Syrian-Jewish rabbi named Jack Kassin, Hassidic community leader Jack Avital, and another businessman named Sam Domb – placed an ad in the New York Times offering their condolences, although Domb later complained to The Jewish Week that Kassin had added his name without consent. Kassin was invited to attend the funeral but a Syrian official informed him that his security could not be guaranteed because of threats posed by Asad’s brother and rival Rifat, according to The Jewish Week''

            That is quite a post you have laid out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me ask you this, Has Assad done anything to upset you?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea why the Israelis haven't taken out Assad, probably because the Russians would obliterate them if they did. The Israelis bomb his forces almost weekly to help their pet project isis but as we all know here that kind of thing isnt reported on the news so the average person has no idea. Netanyahu has been called to the Russian embassy on more that one occasion to explain himself and supposedly deals have been made.

             I explained in the beginning of my post why i did this research and here i am sharing what i found. To me, it's quite clear that Assad is not a sincere leader against ZOG, just look at his family history.

             Russia would never bomb Israel. Putin is a puppet of Chabad and has many times stated that he is all for Israel.

             He is a puppet of the zog whos rebeling against the zog to some degree perhaps?  He does seem like a pretty straight up guy.

              I don't see how he's rebelling against ZOG. He's allowed Israel to violate the sovereignty of Syria many times with no consequences or even threat of consequences, nor has he pressured his 'ally' Putin to pressure Israel to stop. I don't think he even cares that his country is in ruins as long as he gets to stay in power which looks to be the case.

              I think the point of the civil war in Syria was never about removing Assad from power but to weaken Syria to the point where it could never regain it's strength and pose any threat to Israel ever again. Assad will still get to live the high-life, only the Syrian people are the victims of this war eventually.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember that Assad gave Putin the green light to bombard the living shit out of many Syrian cities through air strike which led to many civilian casualities and Assad never showed that he gave a shit about those civilian eithers. Russia helped to accelerate the destruction of many Syrian cities and areas which didn't seem to bother Assad.

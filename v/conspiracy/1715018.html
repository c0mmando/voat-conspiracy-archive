<p>The solutions are presented by the corporate and governmental media, who essentially control the mainstream national conversation. The solutions are always presented in the form of dichotomies. This vs. That. &quot;If only we had more of <em>this</em> and less of <em>that</em> then things would begin to right themselves!&quot; is an <em>extremely</em> common line of thinking. It works when the correct dichotomy is chosen, but fails otherwise. </p>
<p>So, to retain power, the already-powerful use the media to broadcast dozens of dichotomies as proposed solutions, down to the increasingly-confused and angry populations as the economy begins to fail. They try out every dichotomy, but only those that are the most simple and seem to be in line with the truth as observed by an average person, only those really have any sticking power in the national culture. So ideas like this race vs that race, or this political party vs that political party, or men vs women, this religion vs that religion... all these dichotomies have the appearance of power, they seem important and are visible in our day-to-day, but they are not the root cause of many of humanity\'s problems. Yet media harps again and again on these particular dichotomies, in hopes that we\'ll focus on them and take them in to our mindsets, and use them to inform our world, use them as the lens through which everything else is viewed, getting us hooked on seeing the world through that particular dichotomy. Then once embedded, to admit the dichotomy isn\'t that important is akin to killing a part of oneself, the framework of ideas carefully developed around that dichotomy would become useless, so the ego will generally not allow it and will defend the dichotomy despite it perhaps being understood on some level that it\'s a stilted way to look at the world. If the ego is strong enough, and reinforced often enough (usually though the media), it can override this nagging voice. </p>
<p>Things that get closer to the <em>real</em> dichotomy of power are ignored by the media, pretending they don\'t exist. The powerful vs the non-powerful. The hyper-wealthy vs the poor. The 99% vs the 1% had public consciousness for a short time, but even that is a misnomer because it\'s more like the 99.999% vs the 0.001%. We see the media routinely blackballing these ideas from the public consciousness, abusing people\'s trust in the media to frame the conversation. Many people trust the media not only to say what the truth is, but also to say what the truth <em>isn\'t</em>, by way of ignoring it. By not telling the whole truth, which is a type of lying. Lying by omission. This is rampant in modern media, where stories are presented without context, as if they were random scraps of information caught out of the wind. The lack of context and detail in media presentations keeps the masses guessing at what truly happened, and keeps them tilting at their ideologically-empowered false-dichotomy windmills. Which of course the media is all-too-happy to keep reinforcing for ratings, causing the media to splinter in to biased media that caters to their particular population (white nationalists, BLM activists, democrats, republicans, etc). Then after the media is fractured, now the different groups aren\'t even getting the same <em>information</em> much less the same bias. So they continue to drift apart ideologically, because they have completely different viewing portholes on the world. They aren\'t seeing the same world, because they get a different selection of facts, on top of which ideological biases are then projected. </p>
<p>All the powerful ideas that can actually change society are largely hidden from the masses. All the real dichotomies are ignored in lieu of opinion-pieces about these strawman dichotomies, where they compare the worst of &quot;the other side&quot; to the best of &quot;their side&quot; and throw their hands up in exasperation at how the other side and anyone who supports them &quot;just doesn\'t get it.&quot; Meanwhile, the opposite side is doing the exact same. All this conflict arising from human bias takes up peoples\' energy, energy those people think they\'re spending wisely because they believe in the validity of their particular preferred dichotomy and the worldview that creates. All this wasted energy is as wasted as if it were expended in a video game or sport, it has no net effect on the world as it functions. This it the difference between virtue signalling and actual virtue. One accomplishes nothing other than making the signaler feel righteously correct, at the expense of &quot;the other&quot; being vilified, slightly widening the divides in our society. </p>
<p>This is happening in the US. This is happening in almost every country, language, and religion in the world in 2017. We are tightly connected now, and economic panic spreads through the global system in an increasingly non-compartmentalized way. </p>
<p>So we are all seeing these false dichotomies being pushed by every corporate-owned media outlet AND every governmental-owned media outlet. People at the top who put us in to our current system do <em>not want to be blamed for this shit.</em> They want you blaming black or white people, they want you blaming men or women, they want you blaming foreigners or Democrats or Republicans. They want you blaming anyone who might try to call <em>them</em> out. They want to turn the angry mob that they themselves created, against their enemies. </p>
<p>The only thing that can stop is it our intelligence. People have to fall for these tricks for them to work. If people realize who caused all these problems, and ask for them to be held accountable, and are not swayed by the medias\' siren song of false dichotomies, then <em>we can change this</em>. </p>
<p>I know we\'re tired and bowbeaten. I know there are innumerable problems. I know we\'re being lied to by the people who are only in power because we allow it. </p>
<p>This stuff has critical mass. It cannot go on forever. The people can only take so much. History shows us this, again and again. </p>
<p>The only solution is for more and more people to wake up to the reality of our situation, and see the lies for what they are, and to stop listening to them. </p>
<p>As those who are awake get cast more and more strongly outside the bounds of &quot;society&quot; as defined by the corporate/governmental media, more people will wake up. Soon, this itself will become a big dichotomy, &quot;real society&quot; (as defined by MSM) and &quot;conspiracy theorists / kooks&quot; (those who actually know how the world works). When 50% of the society is not considered to be social outcasts because of their ideology, despite living in the system, how long can a system like that really stand? Can a nation\'s government really last if nobody is buying what they\'re peddling? Part of having power over hundreds of millions of people is realizing that those people can have a revolution at any time. Thus you can only abuse them so strongly, for so long, before there begins to be backlash. And you can fight that backlash only so strongly, for so long, before people start seeing the oppressively violent system for what it is. Things continue to escalate, sometimes even through civil war, until no one is left siding with the abusers anymore. Then a new government is put in place, which inevitably starts the clock on the abusers\' struggles to regain power again. Sometimes they even capture the revolution before it is finished! This can put the public in a situation where those put in power are worse than those who came before. Then, another revolution is required. However sometimes the people are spent, or enough people are ideologically wedded to the new people in power, that having a second revolution can be hard and might take time to precipitate as people come to realize the new boss is just as bad as the old boss. </p>
<p>This can place the nation in a state of perpetual revolution, where having revolutions is the expected norm. If the original rulers were bad, the 2nd group got infiltrated and was also bad, but the 3rd group is genuinely good, then you might see a situation where the 1st and 2nd groups work together to use propaganda, and the momentum of a \'culture of revolutions\', to overthrow the 3rd group, wherein they can put in a 4th group (having learned from the PR mistakes of the 2nd group, and having a significantly more worn-down and confused public by this time).  
</p>
<p>It is said that the best kind of governance is a benevolent dictatorship. It is, however, also true that the worst kind is a malevolent dictatorship. It seems having the position of dictator creates a lot of variability. Therefore it seems like the only real solution for stability is to do away with positions of high power. No more dictators, no more kings, no more presidents, no more prime ministers. Can you imagine this world? Can you imagine a world culture that is so strong in these beliefs that they disallow psychopaths and sociopaths from arising to power in the first place? </p>
<p>Earth is a very harsh to live and die, but let\'s at least counter the mainstream narrative-building with our own unique narratives and media, so that we can regain control of our culture for ourselves. Before we can have an external revolution that truly fixes our situation, we will first have a billion-fold internal revolutions of the mind, where we each wake up to the truth. Where we cast aside false narratives designed to control us, like water off a duck\'s back. Where we each decide what we realistically want our future to be and work together to achieve it.</p>',

            You nailed it. People instinctively get on the dichotomy band wagon. It's the primitive "us" vs "them" mentality. This is why I don't identify with either the Democrats or Republicans. I think there are better ways to solve things rather than Us vs Them.

            For decades the liberals have espoused the "humanity as one team" idea but them Obama gets elected and that's suddenly gone. Now from the liberals it's all about intolerance, riots, damaging property, and throwing a tantrum like a 4 year old.

             Tribalism. It is one of the greatest problems of modern humanity, I would say.

              For decades the liberals have espoused the "humanity as one team" idea but them Obama gets elected and that's suddenly gone.

             I have noticed this recent election especially caused a lot of rifts within the Democratic party and Republican parties both. It seems very hard to work as a team (team humanity) in this modern age, for some reason. I think this tribalism, this dichotomy of "us vs them" is at the core of that. And the more "on the defense" people feel, the more this emotionally-charged tribalism comes in to play.

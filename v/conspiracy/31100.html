            This is what caught my attention...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             William Robert "Tosh" Plumlee admits to being in Dealey Plaza when President Kennedy was shot from ambush, in Dallas Tx. Nov. 22, 1963, he has however consistently failed to provide an adequate timeline for all of his movements, in the hours leading up to the assassination
            </p>
            <p>
             He says he piloted an aircraft into Dallas that day, yet has failed to disclose who his passengers were, and whether anything he knows ties in with the presence of the Luther Kings and Andy Warhol, with shooters on the Grassy Knoll.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I have read about him coming forward about knowledge about other operations. Here is an article where "Former local DEA officials Phil Jordan and Hector Berrellez are alleging that CIA operatives killed the late DEA Special Agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena.  Former CIA contract pilot Tosh Plumlee joined Jordan and Berrellez in making the allegations."
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_24343140/ex-dea-officials-make-bombshell-allegations-about-kiki">
              Plumlee, who appears in a famous group photo taken in Mexico City in 1963, said he knows the pilot who flew the plane Caro Quintero used when the kingpin fled Mexico to Costa Rica to try to escape the arm of the law over Camarena's murder.
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Damn, the link you posted has a lot to do with the photo being referenced.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "He was a CIA contract pilot, too," Plumlee said. "And I stand by my previous statements that I flew airplanes out of Caro Quintero's ranch in Mexico that carried drugs and guns."
            </p>
            <p>
             Plumlee said he encountered Kiki Camarena in the U.S. when the DEA agent was investigating the clandestine flights that ferried drugs from Central America to the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             What he told Camarena may have pushed the DEA agent to delve further into the suspicious flights, and this could have led to his abduction and death, Plumlee said.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said that looking back on things, he regrets telling Camarena that as far as he knew the U.S. government had authorized the suspicious flights.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This would be an investigation he would want to influence. His history in clandestine flights could be revealed and other pilots could be implicated in past flights. He is not naming the CIA contract pilot which he knows. Does this pilot have anything to do with the JFK assasination?
           </p>
           <p>
            What did Camarena discover in regards to suspicious flights? There were CIA contract pilots who were running drugs and money  on flights authorized by the US Government. Was  Camarena silenced because his investigation could have lead to discovering of witnesses pertaining to suspicious flights in Dallas on the day JFK was assassinated?
           </p>
           <p>
            Another agency was a threat to the CIA and its way of doing business. With all of his regret Plumlee has about telling Camarena, he still will not name the CIA contract pilot.
           </p>

            Thanks for sharing.

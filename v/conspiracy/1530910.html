            it's a great documentary and thanks much for sharing it, but to pin almost everything on the CFR without ever once mentioning orgs like AIPAC was very disappointing to me
           </p>
           <p>
            it pisses me off that even the alt-media, for the most part, absolutely refuses to address the role of the Jewish-Zionist criminal cabal in geopolitics, the media, entertainment, banking, education, etc., etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            and i'm not the Jew-hater here, but there is, in fact, a very toxic element of Jewry who has an incredible influence in every single major institution in the U.S.

             Thanks for the feedback :)

             I've been trying to piece things together over the past few months. Though I've only just started posting stuff that I find, so it'll take a while to get everything out there :D
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll have a look for other pieces of the puzzle that include AIPAC. Follow me if you want to be kept in the loop :)

               “I’ve never seen a President — I don’t care who he is — stand up to them. It just boggles the mind. They always get what they want. The Israelis know what is going on all the time. I got to the point where I wasn’t writing anything down. If the American people understood what a grip these people have got on our government, they would rise up in arms. Our citizens certainly don’t have any idea what goes on.” — Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral in the US Navy and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from an interview with Mordecai Gur, 1973

They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat.

               “This conspiracy of democratic Jews and Free Masons dragged Europe into war two years ago. Arms had to decide. … Since then a struggle has been taking place between truth and lies and, as always, this war will end in the victory for truth. In other words, whatever lies British propaganda, international world Jewry and its democratic accomplices may concoct they will not change historical facts. And it is a historical fact that for two years now Germany has been defeating one opponent after another. … I did not want it. Immediately after the first conflict I again held out my hand. I have been a soldier myself and I know how difficult it is to win a victory. … My hand was rejected. And since then we have seen that each peace offer was immediately exploited by the warmonger Churchill and his confreres so that they could say it was proof of our weakness.” — Adolf Hitler in a radio broadcast from Berlin to the German people, 1941

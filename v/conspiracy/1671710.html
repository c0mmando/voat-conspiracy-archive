            It might amaze a few readers to know that the assorted Trudeau scandals have been studied by serious  scholars, including Canadian folklorists.  One research paper I have at hand is a collection of Trudeauisms, including satire songs and jokes. Two of the more amusing are:
           </p>
           <p>
            Q:  What has the most fingerprints - the RCMP,  CIA  or MTA?
A:  MTA - Margaret Trudeau's ass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q:  What do Margaret Trudeau and Maureen McTeer have in common?
A:  They both like to blow a little dope?
           </p>
           <p>
            [Ms. McTeer was P.M. Joe Clark's wife.   Margaret Trudeau was widely known to be an addictive pot smoker.  She passed that pleasure on to her son Justin.]
           </p>
           <p>
            "MARGARET" - satire recorded by Toronto disc jockey Frank Proctor
D-jay Frank Proctor recorded the satire "MARGARET" in 1977,
but it got banned from Canadian radio after a few weeks. The
song predated Maggie's display of pudenda by two years.
The recording is on YOUTUBE.  Just jump to MARGARET.
           </p>
           <p>
            WIKIPEDIA articles often discuss a given events "Cultural Impact", or how often it is referenced  or parodied in the Popular Culture. There is certainly other Trudeau trash besides the campaign button I could share here in the Blog, but perhaps the most interesting referent is a printed album jacket produced in Vancouver in 1979.  It is for the punk rock band "D.O.A."  who recorded a record entitled "TRIUMPH OF THE IGNOROIDS".  The first pressing off the record was 1000 copies and it sold out instantly... perhaps a testament to the qualities of the music, or maybe because buyers sensed that a shot of Margaret Trudeau's hairy snatch might amuse their friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            D.O.A. - Vancouver punk band - 1979 Margaret Trudeau album cover
           </p>
           <p>
            Trudeau went into deep psycho-therapy and claimed to have given up the recreational drugs.  But there is is some evidence that she never managed to pull herself together.  All through her life she continued to act weird, especially when anyone pointed a camera at her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Married to the Canadian late Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau from 1971 to 1984, Margaret (Maggie) Trudeau made headlines throughout the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were the rumours of “close” relationships with politicians Fidel Castro and Ted Kennedy, TV personality Geraldo Rivera, tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis, and actors Jack Nicholson and Ryan O’Neal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Studio 54 was kind of a hooker, drug, hedonistic den and Maggie is especially remembered for partying with the Rolling Stones on the eve of her sixth wedding anniversary and a subsequent fling with Stones’ guitarist Ron Wood.
           </p>
           <p>
            there is also 1999 naked pic of Margaret Trudeau by singer Bryan Adams...who didn't fuck Maggie?

<p>Distancing yourselves in a social way from people -- exactly what they\'re doing every day with every new story.  Everything is engineered to be polarizing.  Split the people so we don\'t fight them.</p>
<p>Instead, if they\'re so worried about everyone taking it seriously, they should have called it physical distancing.   Instead, they\'re using language that subconsciously steers people toward their goals.    It goes like this and has 2 main goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan bad stuff</li>
<li>Make it sound really good</li>
<li>Let some people know it\'s bad, but seed even worse false stories</li>
<li>Pull a Snopesism with your &quot;indpendent&quot; fact-checking, proving #3 false.</li>
<li>Call them all crackpots and throw out the true research with the seeded hoaxes.</li>
<li>Goal 1: Now proceed unhindered per above</li>
<li>Goal 2: Meanwhile, the people are busy fighting each other because #2 conflicts with the bad things, so you can just fuck them all.</li>
</ol>
<p>DO NOT let them control our speech. Choice of words is actually VERY powerful at coloring perspectives and opinions.  Do NOT let them use newspeak.   Do NOT let them get away with calling things social &quot;justice&quot;, political &quot;correctness&quot;, etc.  Those are not justice and not correct.  They are the opposite.   But this is &quot;myyyy truth&quot;.   No.  It doesn\'t fucking work that way.</p>
<p>If a word has to have a qualifier before it, that undermines the original word, quite often because it\'s the opposite.  Think of all the wonderful sounding bills and laws that were passed... they had to call them something that sounds nice.</p>
<p>This will piss off a sizeable group, but I could also go on about how Q &quot;proofs&quot; need to be dug up and discovered and red string webs woven across a memo board... but why would all that be necessary if there was simply just... proof.  No qualifier is necessary.  Just one small tidbit of incontrovertible, easily verified PROOF.  It could be something 99% of the sheeple would just ignore anyway or call &quot;conspiracy&quot; if the mainstream tells them so, but so far there is nothing that is 100% verifiable.</p>
<p>Beware ANY qualifier before a word.  Distancing.   Justice.    Correctness.    Proof.

            The one thing they're not telling you to do is eat healthier things, boost your immune system, take care of your body. Nono, the shit and pills you've been consuming will do fine, just stop touching loved ones and stay at home, we'll have a vaccine for you and then you can keep not caring again about what we're planning next.

            In my day, it was called personal space.  This whole social distancing mantra reminds me too much of the term social justice.  It's like bile in my throat.  Personal space is good for mental health, so I am glad people are learning to stay the fuck away.

            Lasting damage to the social fabric will occur if the underlying premise of “social distancing” is not exposed. Sure, wash your hands and don’t cough on people, protect the elderly, but God created us with adaptive immune systems and to be social creatures that live in communities; we can’t let the globalist that from us. In Orwell’s 1984, that is exactly what the elite did to the people, they created social isolation, solitary fearful individuals that obeyed the state.  “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”

            I hate the social distancing term and behavior.  It’s so foreign and TEACHES us to be afraid of EVERYONE including family.  I do think more than the virus is going on so I’ll tolerate this for now.  I’ve noticed the longer it goes the less likely people are to want to be together.  The news and the stats overcomes reason.  It’s pathetic.

             No, it teaches everyone to be more responsible and selective about who they associate with. Dirty niggers and other mud people don't make the cut. Return to the natural order.

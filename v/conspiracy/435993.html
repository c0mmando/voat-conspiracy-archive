           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Taking into consideration the fact that Israel has provided military and medical support to the most bloodthirsty and brutal Islamic extremist terrorists in the world and the fact that it has created Hamas from the very beginning, the answer to the question of “Why aren’t organizations like Nusra, al-Qaeda, and ISIS attacking Israel?” is quite simple – because Israel is partly responsible for funding and directing them.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I believe Israel was responsible for starting the civil war in Syria in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            The clashes in the beginning between Syria's military and the protesters were obviously staged.  We'd be treated to anonymously-sourced YouTube video after video given titles like "Syrian troops fire on protesters" that never once actually showed such a thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that all of this took place as Facebook was gaining hold in much of the Muslim world.  Facebook is the ultimate black-ops resource; where once you'd have to send a team of covert agents into a target nation in order to cultivate the relationships necessary to stage coups and other subversive activities, now you only need backdoor access to the Facebook accounts in the target nation.  You get to see who makes up the opposition, who is likelier than others to resort to "extremism", when and where the rallies are being planned to take place, and so forth.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Israel sends its goons to these peaceful protests, and has one goon busy recording video while another goon fires into a crowd.  Wave the camera around wildly being sure to get some shots of Syrian military way in the distance.  Post it to YouTube, give it the bullshit title, and let the very Jewish news media in the U.S. accept both the video and the premise without reservation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Israel's foreign minister has since announced to the world that regime-change in Syria was always their goal.  Let's not forget that Israel and Syria were then as they are now still in a state of war.  And there's still the matter of who it was who really used chemical weapons in Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hard to believe it was the Syrian government when they were so quick to accept a deal that saw themselves unilaterally dismantling their WMD arsenal.  A gesture that Israel answered by dropping bombs on Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every single atrocity in Syria is likely the handiwork of Israel.

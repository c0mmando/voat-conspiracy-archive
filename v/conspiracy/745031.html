            It seems a lot of these new cannabis legalization laws (both the US and Canada) are backhanded deals with corporate interests. They always limit the number of growers, buyers, sellers, etc. and for some reason the companies that get those privileges always seem to have some connection to the people who made the decision. It's pretty ridiculous. If you tried to restrain any other industry in this manner you would see a backlash in Washington that would have even lifetime politicians scared for their seats.

             Yes they're fucking Colorado over hardcore with the removal of medical rights to grow in their own collectives which did allow for some innovation and competition. They argued they weren't making enough taxes on it that way. You can't tax medicine. MMPR taxes medicine compassion clubs "strive" to tax it. Taxes are a strain and a burden especially on the poor who most need affordable and effective medicine. For this reason they want it to be seen as "recreational.....  yaaaay", because they can tax the shit out of that, while locking the whole of the industry down with a clinical model. Therefore they've been clawing back the rights that people in Colorado had in their constitution, while veterans who wanted to use it there got told to pound sand and pay the recreational tax, lacking that clinical evidence.

             Washington's I502, the code # for impaired driving, was an exercise in subversion and our fucking carnie activists helped them sell out for a few sips of bubbly in high society. People are too busy posting on

             It is being gift wrapped for the old guard via nonsense and contrived concern trolling. They sabotaged Cali's movement with incessant concern trolling in the media and then used the polling they did immediately after to justify their backwards legislation in Washington to pass initiative duid. Then sold it to them with star power and "It's fucked but, like fuck, we can change it later, teehee". It included the means of funneling youth into the system by way of arbitrary DUID bullshit, where they could be sentenced to for profit treatment centers, and sent the bill as a fine. What about when they can't pay the thousands of dollars? Deeper into the system they will go, while our corrupt twat activists danced and chanted "Why are we moving backwards". It's all a giant racket based on contrived public health "concerns" of their own making imposed on the ignorant via mainstream media conditioned. In our case, government funds their "addictions expert usurpers through mental health charity fronts, and while traditionally they were amongst the "schizophrenia/ still developing brain" nonsense, they're now passed off as activist. It's such a fucking joke it's hilarious and I'll be laughing to my early grave because ya can't thrive in a fart bag.

            They'll get the "recreational" bit too. Everyone else will get six plants and spied on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The brute fact is there's no practical difference between medical and recreational they're both figments of the imagination. That's what the clinical imposition and white lab coat cos-play is for.

            All anyone needs is informed and responsible use with personal responsibility. They will never allow that. So we're inundated with trained shills who they're dumping money into the non profits of in order to lobby for them while they masquerade as grass roots activists and the bullshit media parades them in front of us like they're not all just vacuous fart bags. Jonathan Zaid being a prime example.

            I think once weed becomes legalized it's going to be too abundant for any big companies to control. It's a plant from nature FFS, nobody should be allowed to own it.

             can't see that happening considering that dispensary bud ranges from 6/gram to 12-15 a gram depending on strain and lineage.
            </p>
            <p>
             the going rate on the street is 10-15 depending on your dealer.
            </p>
            <p>
             it doesn't cost anywhere near 10/gram to grow regular weed outside. Maybe 2/gram. So they could have taxes up to 80% and I still wouldn't care too much.

              Dispensary prices will react as they're required to. They're not trend setters, they're tailgaters. Their growers are illegal operations. They can be and could have been shut down yesterday. LPs are banking on them to "fill the gaps". When they crank down on it more, the price will rise.
             </p>
             <p>
              LPs and dispensaries have also slowly been increasing prices in a variety of deceptive ways. For instance by offering degraded products made from junk materials and selling them at the same price while marketing it as filet mignon or some discount for the disadvantaged and passing it off as "affordable" which is a requirement of "reasonable access".
             </p>
             <p>
              The LP dilutions as concentrates are a great example of that, representing a massive price leap. Dispensaries would hop along in tow if at all given the option. Recent years should have made it crystal clear they are in collusion, not competition. They risk being cut out but it'll be too late then and the prohibitive model will be what sets prices.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for regular weed outside, who the fuck wants that? That's crap you buy when you have no option. That "Sun Grown" bullshit is from Californian dispensaries and it'll still be crap there too insofar as it fails to mean "controlled environment". It doesn't work here but LPs love the branding and will adopt it. Only here it'll mean hot house penny pinched to the max crap with supplemental lighting sometimes.They are fine with that because they're already pushing UN limits on potency, such as 9% THC, which they were forced into from a preferred 2% limit.

            In what way will it fail? I can't see legalization do anything but thrive in BC, but then again I don't know how it would play out in the other provinces. It could put a dent in funding for the gangs up there which may be a volatile point but I don't know very much.

              It's less of a turn and more of a gentle spin, mostly in the very same spot and it's always said "clinical/tax" based on false divides and bullshit. The people have teeth but not when they're giving gum jobs conditioned to beg for taxing because potheads must be the only ones fucking dumb enough.

             I didnt vote for Trudeau just because he was going to legalize it.  I was actually against him in the beginning.  Like so what,  you're going to legalize it. Big fuckin whoop.  WHAT ELSE are you going to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then mulcair turned into hillary clinton,  and well,  Trudeau was the only one who didn't fuck his campaign up.
            </p>
            <p>
             But legalization isn't a conspiracy.  Canada has very few conspiracies as compared to the US. The US was founded on spying,  terrorism,  and conspiracies.  Canada was founded on fur trading.

               you want to explain further?  How the americans have arguably ruined the world with their dumb war on drugs?
              </p>
              <p>
               you realize that before the world wars,  there was a legal fucking mandate to grow hemp right?  Hemp for victory they called it.
              </p>
              <p>
               if anything,  we're going back to the status quo.
              </p>
              <p>
               its seriously retarded.  If people think legalization is all about recreational use,  then they are SEVERELY braindead.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hemp will supplant the paper industry,  textile industry,  potentially make a huge dent in the pharmaceutical industry,  as well as the plastic industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               NEVERMIND recreational uses.  The war on drugs was much more than the govt worrying about people getting high.

            Fwiw, Jordan Maxwell claims that the Vatican is actually behind it all, the secret societies, and even the Rothschild family, which many people associate with Soros as well. These people pit two to five countries against each other, shorting their stock markets and making billions for their global "investment" funds. It makes sense though that there are those that manipulate the financial world, those for the media, those for politicians and voting bodies etc, but there would need to be a governing body. That is apparently the Vatican.

            Watch the movie Equilibrium with Christian Bale, this movie shows in plain sight what happens behind closed doors. (Not to give the ending away or anything)

             Dutch version

             Deze tekst is met opzet zo geschreven alsof het een Joods/Zionistisch document is om er voor te zorgen dat de aandacht niet gaat naar degenen die er wel achter zitten.

            <p>
             En dat zijn de Illuminatie... wie anders?

            Let me translate it for you:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This text is purposely written as if it's a Jewish/Zionistic document to make sure that the attention is diverted from those who are really behind it.
            </p>
            <p>

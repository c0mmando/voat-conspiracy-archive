            I am pretty sure Trump is not a part of those groups, unless it is super secret.  Trump has openly criticized the NWO, and seems to be sincere about it.  The most concerning connections I have seen are with Chabad.

            Most presidents are surrounded by these fuckers, look how many were surrounded by each president, some had like 30-40 in their cabinets. This is why they want Trump gone, he aint one and I don't think he has any left in his cabinet. Steve Mnuchin is Skull and Bones

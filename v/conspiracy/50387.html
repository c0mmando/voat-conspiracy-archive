            Very valid points. I think my disagreement lies in that ISIS's recent tactics are quite damning, and that they are losing civilian and Imam support across the region. But I also may have jumped the gun on this post, if after ISIS is generally disbanded into pocket cells and we see a more unified peace oriented region I believe the concept of my conspiracy has worth. Even if there was no CIA intervention.

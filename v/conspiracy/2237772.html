            Immigrants right? You know, pop culture is the SOLE reason most people don't look at women as disgusting stink wagons (the truth) that are FAR more costly than beneficial (parasitic). And WOMEN propagate these fictions (there are many) as much or more than men! Sex IS NOT at the pinnacle of human experience as a matter of FACT.

             ? you aren't entirely wrong of course. and just a few years ago i was seriously blackpilled and probably would have completely agreed with you. but i have learned a lot since then and i now realize that sex/reproduction is a vital component of a healthy male/female pair bonding and such bonding and a stable home/family is necessary for producing and raising healthy children which are necessary for a healthy and stable society. shunning all women is not the solution. we simply have to work harder to fight the cancer that is feminism from poisoning and ruining our women (and children) and we need to stand up and be real men and put women back in their place. this is what they ultimately want even though they won't admit it. it's the reason they go for the 'bad boy' and the disgusting feral rapefugees. feminism and women's lib has been a civilizational shit test and we as men have failed.

              Yes but the MARRIAGE should come first (means, supposedly, the couple has gotten to KNOW one another in ways that are FAR more important than coitus, IFF they are thoughtful). Unfortunately, IMO, the suitable options are EXTREMELY limited these days. "Everyone" seems to be creating their own personal god who likes what they like and forgives them automatically. Sex is NOT an objective or casual recreation, nor is it important to be skilled beforehand.

              Feminism (professional victims) is a cancer of the species, propagated by the parasites.
             </p>
             <p>
              My troublex (one of main ones) was that I was raised on the cartoon version of the Bible (trotted out by the professional victims). Where everyone is the same. There was NO mention of good figs, bad figs, wheat and tares, nor kenites (children of Cain). That is a HORRIBLE mistake to make with your offspring. You consort with miscreants they WILL corrupt you (Bible). Hey even God shortened (revelation the tribulation from 3 years to 5 months) because he KNEW
              <strong>
               EVERYONE
              </strong>
              would fall if he didn't.

              Thing one, THANKS for responding (lets converse). Thing two. No, but a little intoxicated, as usual, when I like to ANONYMOUSLY converse on the internet with others. Thing Three. I have NO problem with drug use, unless, you try to say it's the REASON you victimized someone. In the future, would you PLEASE refer to the POST I made that motivated you. I'm a sailor, which means I'm slow in ways that you are accustomed to and FAST in ways that you are NOT accustomed to. K?

               It seemed to me that your comment had nothing to do with the subject matter which is something I have done while high on weed (which is legal in my state). Maybe I didn't read your post correctly, but I couldn't make a connection between the topic and your comment.

                 Your comment: Immigrants right? You know, pop culture is the SOLE reason most people don't look at women as disgusting stink wagons (the truth) that are FAR more costly than beneficial (parasitic). And WOMEN propagate these fictions (there are many) as much or more than men! Sex IS NOT at the pinnacle of human experience as a matter of FACT.

                    Well there's the 10 northern tribes who supposedly (my preacher) crossed the Caucasus mountains and became the Caucasions (white people)? Not sure about that one yet. Anyway I go BLINDLY with my ancestors because they were NOT idiots, and they SURVIVED and propogated through times MUCH more egregious than present day (so far).

                    Liberals "think" they get to make it up as it comes along and their PERSONAL convenience is ALWAYS factored in.

                   <p>
                    I prefer PRINCIPLES. God is UNCHANGING. I
                    <strong>
                     LIKE
                    </strong>
                    that about him.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    ALL I "want" is to be segregated from the evil in all its forms that I've encountered in mortal life. I CERTAINLY do NOT want more evil. SO I cozy up to God (creator of all things) as described by MY ancestors.

                    Jew...What's wrong with that? Certainly better than nigger or women or veteran. AT LEAST there is a WELL thought out plan of PRINCIPLE, as opposed to just WANTING special treatment.

                      It's just rhetoric that I cannot "spew" publically, due to the FACT that I would be destroyed if I did. Who hurt me? Evil hurt me. Just like most everyone else. I'm looking for solutions, but I started thinking that salvation was IMPORTANT, and pop culture was evil, FAR too late (not as a child).

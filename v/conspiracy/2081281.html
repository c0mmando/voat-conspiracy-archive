             “The speech was a disappointment to many who had supported his calls during the campaign to end expensive foreign intervention and nation-building,” wrote Breitbart’s Pentagon correspondent Kristina Wong in the site’s lead article. “He acknowledged the frustration that Americans felt after 16 years of war without an end in sight.”

            Trump specifically mentioned he won't be "nation-building," and we have concern trolling claiming that's what he wants to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my own opinion: I was against these engagements from the beginning (specifically Iraq; Afghansistan would have been manageable had we not been under the guidance of
            <a href="http://archive.is/zmgxd">
             Rumsfeld's misguided strategy
            </a>
            that led to
            <a href="http://archive.is/4lnNF">
             the families of soldiers providing equipment that the military lacked.
            </a>
            )
My point is, it was a mistake to get involved in the first place. But I remember those days after September 11th, everyone wanted revenge. We let the politicians lie to us, and as soon as the going got tough, we wanted out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say the only way to end this is to fully commit. Re-instate the draft, overwhelm the enemy, and kill them all. The men are combatants, the women are their support network, and the children are the next generation of warriors who will kill your children if you see fit to spare them. If you kill their fathers and subjugate their mothers to occupation, what makes you think they will grow up to love you?
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course I know this will never happen. This is fucking Viet Nam all over again. Everyone wants to win but no one wants to get dirty. That's how you lose.

             <p>
              According to the
              <a href="http://archive.is/wXRTC">
               Fort Benning's Maneuver Self Study Program:
              </a>
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The American campaign in Afghanistan was launched in response to al-Qaeda's use of Afghan territory, granted by the Taliban government, to plan and launch the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. At the outset, the objectives of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan therefore included the defeat of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and affiliated groups in Afghanistan, as well as the development of a stable and legitimate Afghan government that would serve as a U.S. partner in denying the use of Afghan territory to terrorist networks. A principal strategic rationale underlying the efforts of the United States and its NATO partners in Afghanistan was the notion that fragile states with weak institutions, particularly those dangerous and volatile regions, have the potential to serve as safe havens for transnational terrorist groups.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              At the outset, people perceived these goals to be achievable because they made the assumption that these groups were organized in a fashion similar to traditional states. It only took three months to topple Saddam Hussein's Iraqi Government because it had this traditional state structure.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember seeing one of the Delta Force operatives involved in
              <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Battle_of_Tora_Bora">
               The Battle of Tora Bora
              </a>
              interviewed on PBS a long time ago. He claimed they had Bin Laden cornered but the native Afghan mercenaries they had to use wanted to negotiate with Bin Laden instead of taking him out. This ultimately led to his escape. Because we wouldn't commit enough resources, our reliance on native mercenaries backfired.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now that Bin Laden is presumed dead, and for all intents and purposes we can assume this to be correct, there has still been growth in the underlying terrorist structure.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               What exactly are we trying to win in Afghanistan?
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I understand the jist of this question to be that the ultimate goal of defeating the Taliban and the Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is vague simply because the groups themselves are not well defined states with an observable organizational structure.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would say you are correct and that this is the fundamental flaw we face with the war in Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe the only solution is to kill all the native inhabitants and replace them with United States Colonists. Anything short of this type of commitment is doomed to fail. This type of commitment will never be realized, and so any effort is doomed to fail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Knowing that any of these efforts are doomed to fail does not change the fact that we must recognize that something must be done involving the state of affairs in Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <p>
              At this point, inaction, similar to the inaction realized under President Obama's tenure, will result in the manifestation of new hostile state that will eventually struggle to control the region in a manor similar to the Islamic State.
             </p>
             <p>
              When this occurs, there will be another war, anyway. What the people in power are doing is postponing the need for an "all-in" commitment until their tenure is over, and they can pass the buck to the next poor sucker that inherits the responsibility. It's like the worst game of "hot potato" ever played, with real lives at stake and generational implications.
             </p>
             <p>
              My ultimate take away from everything I've seen in the past three decades is that we can't just close our eyes and assume the problem will go away. At some point, there will be an "all-in" commitment simply to ensure our own survival.
             </p>
             <p>
              To me, a win in Afghanistan would be the total removal of the native population, and their replacement by US citizen colonists. This is the only way to ensure a future of peace. But I know this will not happen, there is no political will for it to happen and there has been two centuries of anti-colonialist brainwashing that populations have had to endure.

               The operations that Islamic terrorists are conducting don't require state cooperation. They can and have trained in the U.S. itself, not to mention the fact that the U.S. has given them material support in Syria. I don't see any return on the investment we are making in Afghanistan, it would be better to allow it to become a failed state with thousands of tribal leaders who answer to no one.

                I agree that would be an ideal path. But I think the current leaders are worried that Russia will try and annex them again. And if not Russia, they're simply afraid of allowing any kind of consolidation of power in the  Middle East. If they descend into tribalism, it is only a matter of time before China, India, or Iran attempts to make Afghanistan a vassal state of their own. There is not going to be a pretty outcome, no matter how you shake this one out.

            My greatest fear is that after all the bluster and effort trump will end up being moderated by main stream political pressure.

             I have the same fear but I worry the pressure will come from the Deep State and Trump will make concessions to stay alive and in office. More wars, no wall, more spying on all of us, more swamp water days basically.

              well, so far we can check one off the list.  more wars.  the recent Afghanistan speech.  I dont think its as black and white as that but here we are anyway.

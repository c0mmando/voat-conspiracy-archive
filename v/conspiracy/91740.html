            I'm young, this happened not to long before I was born. What the actual fuck happened?
           </p>
           <p>
            "On August 8, 1978, a deadly end came to an almost year-long standoff with police over a court order requiring MOVE to vacate their Powelton Village house.[8] When police attempted entry, shooting erupted and PPD officer James J. Ramp was killed by a shot to the back of the head. MOVE representatives claimed that he was facing the house at the time and deny MOVE responsibility for his death. Seven other police officers, five firefighters, three MOVE members, and three bystanders were also injured. Nine MOVE members were each sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison for third degree murder for Ramp's killing. Seven of the nine first became eligible for parole in the spring of 2008, but were denied it. Parole hearings now occur yearly."
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1981, MOVE relocated to a row house at 6221 Osage Avenue in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia. After the move, neighbors complained for years that MOVE members were broadcasting political messages by bullhorn at all hours and also about the health hazards created from piles of compost. On May 13, 1985, after the complaints as well as indictments of numerous[quantify] MOVE members for crimes including parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terrorist threats,[11] the PPD attempted to clear the building and arrest the indicted MOVE members. This led to an armed standoff with police,[12] who lobbed tear gas canisters at the building. MOVE members fired at the police, who returned fire with automatic weapons.[13]PPD Commissioner Gregore Sambor then ordered that the compound be bombed.[14] From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, PPD Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs made of FBI-supplied water gel explosive, a dynamite substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house.[15]
           </p>
           <p>
            The resulting explosions ignited a massive blaze that eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses. The firefighters, who had earlier deluge-hosed the MOVE members in a failed attempt to evict them from the building, stood by and watched the inferno caused after the military grade C-4 bomb engulfed the first house,
            <strong>
             refusing to intervene because they had been given orders to let the fire burn.
            </strong>
            Officials feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters, as they had done before.[16][17][15][18] Eleven people (John Africa, five other adults and five children) died in the resulting fire.[19] Ramona Africa, one of the two survivors, stated that police fired at those trying to escape the burning house, while the police stated that MOVE members had been firing at police."

             There's a good documentary on netflix, "Let the Fire Burn."  Check it out.  It was pretty shocking when it was going on certainly, but it's gone on since.  Look at Waco...

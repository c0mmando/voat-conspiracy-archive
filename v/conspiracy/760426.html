            The UFO conspiracy environment is corrupted with a lot of disinformation and discrediting tactics.  There's a lot of BS to sift through.

             Very true. I read a bunch of stuff last night, now this morning I'm sitting here thinking: the whole thing about UFOs and aliens is just a part of this experience.  By far more important is the revelation that the lies and crime and suborning and viciousness and unimaginable cruelty all go so very much deeper than I've ever thought about.  That's the issue now.  I'll get back to UFOs, or rather take in what I can along the way, but I got to tell you, I'm baffled this morning about where you set out to understand, never mind correct, this incredibly ugly human condition where lies and more lies are, most likely, the object of a lot of glee and wild craziness among the group that creates it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Clearly I am an innocent lamb.  Led a pretty sheltered life, I admit it.  It's so disappointing.  I remember reading in a book by Scott Peck years ago, "People Of The Lie", that most of us are so conditioned away from believing the worst of others, that when we encounter something truly evil we have no mental framework with which to perceive it!  And so, end up not even comprehending what we're looking at.  I feel that way now. My thanks to these more experienced souls who have given me such a poor night's rest; I do thank you.  I still have no idea what I might do with this information, but at least I'm not as asleep as I was yesterday.  That has to count for something, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks again. I'm not looking forward to this course of study.

              Really this kind of disinformation awareness applies to almost any kind of study, whether history or occult or conspiracy.  You always have to be aware of those that are there to lead you in the wrong direction through diversionary tactics or outright lies.  I would strongly suggest the work of

            I have studied the UFO phenomenon for quite some time, speaking with witnesses, investigating sightings. I also investigated other stuff. Investigating it yourself is the only way you can get the truth about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            My hypothesis is that there are many outer-dimensional beings, outside our common 3D physical world. See Jacques Vallee. It fits with almost all serious witness accounts and evidence that I have met so far.
           </p>
           <p>
            The photographs will become blurry due to the dimensions overlapping.
            <br/>
            They appear at certain places because these places are more open to other dimensions.
            <br/>
            The witnesses often have more connection to other dimensions, and often have spiritual capabilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best UFO evidence often show light-balls that move in a weird way and can get close to physical objects. The foo-fightser, Hessdalen and most mexican sightings are in this category.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other sightings, including abductions have a more Oz-effect on them. That may indicate that reality is somehow broken.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also interesting research into abductions and cow-mutulations.
            <br/>
            Linda Molton Howle has good information about it. She has a lot of interesting information about this. The idea that she presents is very scary: both aliens and military are actively abducting and manipulating people for different agendas. From my hypothesis, this would only be possible on certain places and under certain circumstances (and possibly with certain people).
           </p>
           <p>
            There certainly is an involvement of the military in this matter. There are many ufo-sightings that were later followed by military actions in some way. They certainly have some information that the are not sharing. They seem to use the UFO phenomenon in many ways:
            <br/>
            1) Continuous declarations of that they are fake, as if they are not taken seriously in whatever way.
            <br/>
            2) Sightings are send to a central base, were they are kept secret.
            <br/>
            3) Planting of hoaxes.
            <br/>
            4) Planting of fake explanations (U2/Mongul anyone?).
            <br/>
            5) Hiding of extraordinary technology (Aurora/pulse-engine).
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who has seen the published documents, will have spotted the many black lines involved in these cases. There is 100% proof of that they are hiding something. Since some sightings are directly related to nukes, these sightings should be considered very important.
           </p>
           <p>
            The disclosure project goes a lot deeper. It tries to expose many of the military operations on the UFO subject. My own opinion is that many of these people were informed with false information, so that their interesting findings would be easy to dismiss.
            <br/>
            The first atomic bomb has been kept totally secret for a long time, by using small cells of specialized people that each know nothing about the subject. You can that a similar structure is used in the UFO phenomenon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides the military there is also a very active community that is attacking everything related to UFOs and aliens. Often they stage hoaxes too.
           </p>
           <p>
            That does not mean that there are no hoaxes. There are many youtube-channels out there that just claim every bird or rocket launch to be a UFO. Some other channels show that certain UFOs are CGI-hoaxes or caused by reflections in the sky. But they often generalize that this means that everything is a hoax.
           </p>
           <p>
            And not everything UFO is aliens either. And, as I witnessed myself, there is far more than our society accepts.

            Not to disagree, but at the moment I'm more into 'stuff' and why I can't get a good look at it... the whole topic of whether or not things exist is a background investigation to my current puzzlement that what's available is so fumblefooted.  But hey, what do I know?  Nothing.

            if your root question is whether we are/have been visited by our "off-world brothers" as i call them, then i don't think i could expand a hell of a lot more than what

           <p>
            however, the problem is that there is a lot of disinformation out there - for instance, if i saw a UFO today, my first ? would be; is it ours, or theirs?

            most importantly - and this is KEY to understanding why the matter has been so covered up - is the simple, logical fact that "they" are not using fossil-based fuels or rockets to get here - now imagine the consequences that 'big oil' would have to face if this technology were released to the public - this would - not 'could' - lead to a complete transformation of society

           <p>
            in the long run, i'm not exactly sure what to make of Greer, but there can be no doubt that a) we have been visited and b) they ain't burnin' gasoline - they must be "traveling" at "speeds" that are faster than light - you'll understand why i put those words in quotes if you study Greer's work ... or quantum physics

             Thanks for your considered reply.  I'll happily check the sources you quote.  You ask about my root question, whether we are/have been visited, and it's more that I've begun to think, "I should check this out", only to find the file of information rather smaller than I expected and kind of smudged.  And I'm thinking,  "There's been so much effort put into this...why aren't the results a little more coherent?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the 'big oil' reference, that's understandable- if we've learned anything at all lately, it's that money talks- but I'd have thought the offworlders themselves wouldn't mind clearing things up a bit.  Unless they're thinking of us in the way we think of seeing a few ants around the house, wondering if there's a nest somewhere we'll have to do something about.   Off to click blue lines...

              we're getting into theories here, not facts, but the presiding belief among the ET community is that they have a "non interference" policy which, when you consider the nuclear minute-man silo interventions where multiple military personal have testified (watch the National Press Club event i linked to) that UFO interfered with their ability to launch, does not seem entirely accurate - make of it what you will, but, to put it another way, don't expect them to land on the whitehouse lawn - we have to solve our own problems, especially if we want to be free - expecting someone else to intervene teaches us nothing, i think you might agree
             </p>
             <p>
              it is a VERY common question though - study the works others and myself linked to - you'll quickly get the picture

               I will, thank you.  Fascinating listening to Steven Greer; though I won't decide for some time yet, I must say his statements seem practical and likely. Especially where he suggests that he is still alive because of a standoff between power-groups. If I were he, I would be concerned for my family.  If roadside police can be vicious, how black is a black-op heart?
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit to add:  I see what you mean about a non-interference policy.  On the other hand, any student of humans would quickly learn that it's dumb to allow that bully room to swing his fist.  Scale that up to the energies we're thinking about, and if I were an ET, I'd be damn careful with how close I let a human mind approach me.  And if, as Greer suggests, humans have been working with these energies for sixty years now,  that approach may not be as unformed as I've been supposing....

                basically Greer posits that there are people deep on the inside that want this information to come out and that's why he is protected
               </p>
               <p>
                when you dig into this further, i think you'll find that it's the people that tried to expose secrets in an a limited, anonymous way that committed "suicide" by shooting themselves ... in the back of the head ... twice :)
               </p>
               <p>
                there are many examples, such as those that tried to patent resonant energy technology (study Tesla) - they get bought out, discredited, arrested, or killed when all else fails
               </p>
               <p>
                Greer, and many others, have taken an opposite approach by blasting it into the public record and this does indeed seem to offer them a degree of protection
               </p>
               <p>
                again though, be careful who you trust - at this point i personally have little reason to distrust Greer, yet i sense something is not exactly right - maybe he's just holding back information, maybe more, or maybe not - there are only a few people who i absolutely feel are 100% creditable and one of them is

                 Miriam Delicado
                </a>
                - BUT, even in these cases, although i
                <em>
                 know
                </em>
                for myself that these people are authentic and ethical, what i don't know is whether they were lied to
               </p>
               <p>
                keep researching - it's a fascinating road!

                - he is one more of the very few people i trust whose ethics are
                <em>
                 absolutely unquestionable
                </em>
                from my perspective - he "killed himself" by wrapping a rubber hose around his neck in an very unlikely "suicide" (read the autopsy reports) - it's people like this, who have been murdered, that you can bet know the truth, or at least significant parts thereof

            I used to be very interested in UFOs, crop circles, Martian artifacts and other paranormal subjects when I was in my mid-teens. I used to watch all of the shows and read books about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I grew up I started to realize that most fantastic things in our society match a theme of stories that are purely for entertainment and or influence. I found that most stories in human history are witnessed by uneducated, uninformed people who become useful idiots in perpetuating these tales for financial and political gain or to simply provide a distraction form real-world issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reality is far more interesting but it is also a lot more troublesome. It's troublesome for the common people because if they knew the reality of things they would see how bad things are and also troublesome to the elite ruling class who do no want their subjects to revolt and to change reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            I categorize aliens in with religion and entertainment. The fact is that the universe what with expansion and size almost completely negate the possibility of alien visitors. I won't say one way or another if they have been here because it's a pointless argument. I will say that we once believe a being came from another dimension or universe to create our universe and we called it God. We now know that god and religion were used to control populations by adjusting morality and feeding the masses promises and threats.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this I see aliens as the same construct for a new generation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have many things in this world that are false but deemed as possible for the sake of keeping people distracted and loyal. Terrorism, religion, cult followings. They all use fear of the unknown to keep people passive.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reality is not that we will be in contact with aliens. The reality is that we are being systematically abused and maneuvered in an attempt to reduce quality of life in this planet for the sake of the elite ruling class and that instead of wasting time with superstition, we should be trying to make the planet a utopia and create a promise of a future.

             Thank you.  I agree with a large part of what you've said, most particularly your final paragraph.  Certainly I'm not expecting somebody to come visit me any time soon;  and I get what you're saying about the 'useful idiots', of which I may be one.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's interesting to see that the idea of benevolent contact that was so much a part of my youth in the 50s and 60s seems to have given way to a much harsher, 'warriors from afar who know more than we do and haven't done us in just because we're insignificant' kind of rubric.  So we're cast now in the place of having to 'steal' technology, and being told to 'stay away, you won't be tolerated here'.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't suppose I really care one way or the other if they're there (here), I just don't understand what is gained by secrecy and obfuscation.  And, why some of the 'useful idiots' make some sense.

              The whole secrecy angle is just a way to perpetuate the mythos. There is nothing to hide but by pretending there is they can keep people paranoid. It also makes the government look more powerful than they really are.

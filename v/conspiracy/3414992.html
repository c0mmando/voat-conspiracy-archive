             in a country dominated by jews as was Germany during the 20's and the 30's, it would have been impossible for a hostile goy like Hitler to come to power.

            All ballots were on paper back then. Germany was 100% white. That was enough.

             The reaction of Hitler about Dunkirk is also incredible. He can capture the entire English army. But what does he do ? He let them flee. What !!?

           <p>
            Why wouldn’t he? Look at what the UK did for the world. They brought white civilization to damn near half of it on their own. The only thing they did wrong was leave anyone alive in the lands they conquered.

            You have no fucking argument and have exposed yourself.

           <p>
            Which was proven to be mounting an assault to be undertaken two weeks later. By attacking when they had no defensive plans, he utterly destroyed the soviet line and would have forced their surrender before spring 1943, even
            <em>
             with
            </em>

           <p>
            How could he have? The German Navy had a time of it just getting through the North Sea, never mind the English Channel. You can move all the troops you want down to the Italian ports, but without ships to carry them to the mouth, they’re stuck.

             Maybe he would have been obliged to invade Spain also.

           <p>
            So you’re fine with him invading a neutral country, but not the fucking bolshevik jewish nightmare.

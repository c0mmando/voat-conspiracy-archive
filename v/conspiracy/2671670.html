           So as many of you know, the Apollo Moon Landings were a hoax
          </p>
          <p>
           This particular hoax is one of the most important "conspiracy theories" out there to use as a red pill,
          </p>
          <p>
           because once its exposed, it undermines the credibility of the establishment government, media, education, science, etc
          </p>
          <p>
           The Apollo Moon Landing is so obviously fake, so ridiculously impossible, that only an idiot could still believe it after examining the evidence, and working out some basic math and physics.
          </p>
          <p>
           Belief in the moon landings truly is a litmus test for stupid
          </p>
          <p>
           And yet, time and again i encounter people online who claim to be engineers, scientists, etc but who believe in the moon landings.
          </p>
          <p>
           So i look more closely at the psychology of belief in the moon landings.
          </p>
          <p>
           what makes apparently intelligent, educated people believe absurdities that they could debunk themselves just by applying the simple math and science they allegedly learned in school?
          </p>
          <p>
           i often hear people say "we" went to the moon
          </p>
          <p>
           so i correct them and say "no, some other people might have gone to the moon, but
           <em>
            you
           </em>
           didn't go anywhere near the moon
          </p>
          <p>
           so there is this feeling of belonging, sort of like being a sports fan. "we won" the big game. no, "the team" won, and "the fans" merely observed

           so "why do you believe in the Apollo Moon Landings"

          <p>
           becomes
          </p>

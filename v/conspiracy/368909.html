            <p>
             Nothing happens without our consent. Truth be known, we’ve been conditioned and programmed to consent to our own enslavement; misled through the ~~indoctrination~~ educational system to believe we are helpless and impotent; hypnotized by the complexities of legalese and medical terms. We are happy to leave the details to the “experts” so we don’t worry our pretty little heads. But in doing so, we’ve given up our power. Truth is not complex. The devil is in the details. Truth is simple even if it’s not always pretty.

            Republic vs. Democracy
           </h2>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The untold story is that when we signed up for citizenship as U.S. citizens, we signed away our freedom. Without knowing the details, we became employees of a corporation. To find proof, look at line 15(A) in title 28 U.S. Code § 3002 and you will see this sentence, “United States” means— (A) a Federal corporation.”  The act that legally turned the USA into a corporation was the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871.
            </p>
            <p>
             The preamble to the Constitution establishes the United States of America, not The United States, the corporation. So
             <em>
              “Two National Governments exist, one to be maintained under the Constitution, with all its restrictions, the other to be maintained by Congress outside and independently of that instrument”
             </em>
             (Downes v. Bidwell 182 U.S. 244 1901, dissenting opinion of Justice Marshall Harlan).
            </p>
            <p>
             The United States of America is the true dejure Republic. A Republic is a sovereign State in which power resides in the people, when the citizens, at large, govern for the public good. The Republic reverted to a Democracy in 1913 when Woodrow Wilson declared “The American People are unable to make good decisions for themselves so the government needs to be able to make those decisions for them.”

“[M]arriage is a social relation SUBJECT to the State’s police power.” Living v. Virginia, 338 U.S. 1, 7 (1967)
“Marriage under OUR law is a contract – a civil contract. But it is sui generis… The State has a particular interest in such a contract.” Layer v. Banning, 131 N.W. 783, 784 (1911)

              One hundred twenty years ago, no one needed permission to marry. People recorded marriages in the bible, a sacred book, or any book. You were married when you jumped over a broomstick. Once the State created the marriage license, you became subject to their jurisdiction.

             <p>
              Now, everyone who marries with the State is subject to the corporate doctrine. No wonder same-sex marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court in all 50 States.

             How To Withdraw Consent

             <p>
              It is essential to understand the difference between a State citizen and a U.S. Citizen. A State Citizen used to be known as a Citizen of the United States, before the Civil War, but the meaning has been changed twice to intentionally deceive.

              Whether we realize it or not, through our consent (in ignorance), we are the cause of our own suffering to the system which enslaves us. Once we realize our error, the first step becomes
              <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/health/more-than-22000-brave-nurses-refusing-to-submit-to-mandatory-vaccinations/">
               choosing not to submit

              .
             </p>
             <p>
              DO NOT CONSENT. How does that look from a practical standpoint? You can say, “I do not accept this offer to contract. I do not consent.”

             <p>
              Most importantly, realize that our inherent rights do NOT come from the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, or any paper document. Documents are symbols. Inherent rights and freedoms are not dictated by regulations and statutes but by common sense and morals in relationships. They are inherent by birth. Freedom is really a state of mind and a way of life. True freedom is body, mind, spirit coming into alignment to realize our true power, and then acting on it.

              John Adams said, “You have rights antecedent to all earthly governments; rights that cannot be repealed or restrained by human laws; right derived from the Great Legislator of the Universe.”

              We have been led astray for too long and devolved as a species through allowing ongoing wars and deliberate poisonings to our own demise and the demise of the planet. Sudden and overt power grabs of individual liberties reflect acts of desperation by a

              that is on the verge of collapse. Fear is the tool used against us to create instability on a mass consciousness scale to keep us enslaved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Each of us can stop the infectious spread of fear at its source – in our minds. Now is the time to reclaim our power if we expect anything to change. We are the change.

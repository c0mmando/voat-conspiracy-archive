            Why we go so swiftly through this...

           <p>
            Because we regard it as basic knowledge for "truthers" and because WeatherWar101 videos have been around long enough to normally have reached the big crowd already. It makes no sense for us to spell everything out here in detail again when such work already exists and is already online, hence us linking to WeatherWar101 - which is not our channel by the way.

            lol. ok here are things that impact weather that people do. anybody can light a forest on fire so i am not counting that.

            you can drop powdered iron in the ocean, you need to spread it relatively thin and volcanoes do this naturally. you have to cover a very wide region to have an appreciable effect, this takes many boats, many hours, and hundreds of tons of powdered iron. this feeds plant life which utilizes sunlight and cools the local water temperature primarily at the surface, in turn that creates a cold front of air over the water and reduces humidity over the water, that cold front can be used to deflect an existing hurricane, or it can be used against an existing warm water current to help create the conditions for a hurricane (make a hurricane more probable, however it is a solar event that makes the hurricane form, you can't make a hurricane you can just make the right conditions for it and hope the sun makes it happen).
           </p>
           <p>
            you can cause earthquakes by shaking the ground or by using fracking or liquid injection to break up rock under the surface. you can also just vibrate the ground so that loose sedentary layers are shaken until they fall into deeper fissures in layers beneath them (potentially formed by volcanic activity or previous seismic activity). of course the earthquakes caused by this are weaker than if you just allowed one to build up and go off on its own, so in a way this prevents damage over the long term.
           </p>
           <p>
            you can seed rain by collecting ocean water into shallow pools with dark lining at the bottom so that the water evaporates faster, this will bring rain further inland if this is done at a cold front so that the humidity is carried inland by the colder heavier air. you can also cause the air to be more likely to drop water or cause clouds to drop water by seeding it with various materials (aluminum being the most common in use to cause rain to precipitate at a specific spot).
           </p>
           <p>
            you can utilize falling precipitation to create striations in cold fronts causing local shifts in wind, this is not super effective but can deflect a storm to limited degree. this requires a lot of finely powdered aluminum, many planes and is very expensive to do. it also isn't that effective. it is feasible that a cold front is deliberately pushed into a hot front, this would be a rare occasion but when such occasions do arise it theoretically is possible to push them into each other and form tornadoes or dust devils that otherwise would not have formed. the conditions would have to be right, you would have to get a little lucky, and it would be expensive. i doubt people are doing that.
           </p>
           <p>
            it is significantly more reliable and more efficient to just light shit on fire, or use bombs, guns, etc to kill people. hell its cheaper to give them free addictive drugs and let them kill themselves. i highly doubt anyone is using geoengineering to make deliberate attacks. the problem with geoengineering and war is that if you deflect a hurricane from hitting your shores, and it hits someone else's shore, it could be seen as an act of war.

             Actually governments do it all the time, as the constant freak weather proves. Although it is not necessarily to be perceived as "attack" all of the time. Often it are experiments and natural weather substitutes.

             They did in 2013, for instance, in the Philippines.

             Indeed, in the Philippines it was, although not publicly. People know it was an attack, act of war.

             What you forgot to mention in your post above is that microwave and radio pulse signals are also used to pump up weather systems or even create from scratch.

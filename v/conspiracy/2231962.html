            Kevin Spacey... Or another Hollywood Top shot is acussed of being an abuser

            But really, ugh. Wrapping my head around the idea that Bill Cosby is a serial rapist was surreal enough. Now
            <em>
             Kevin Spacey
            </em>
            is a child abuser? God damnit, that's just weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            And there's no way he's the last domino to fall, either. Between now and the Oscars I figure there's bound to be at least one more big name (so not Danny Masterson or the WME guy) to go down in disgrace
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollywood has a history with pedophiles. Corrupt managers have used the promise of stardom to sexually abuse for years, all the way back to the days of Judy Garland. It is, in the words of one movie executive, “a time-honored tradition in this town.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It took the state a long time to do anything about it. Up until 2012, convicted sexual offenders in California were free to work with child actors all they pleased. But even with that change, there are still a lot of dangerous people walking free.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the stories in this article are rumors. Some are facts that have been proven in a court of law. But every one of them makes it clear that there are a lot of men making their fortune in Hollywood who have done terrible things to children—some who have never suffered for their crimes...
The kids in some of the most successful movies of the past 15 years were hand-picked by Jason James Murphy—a convicted pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before he became a casting director, Murphy lived in Seattle, where, according to court papers, he became “obsessed” and “in love with” an elementary school boy. Murphy tried to lure the young boy away, promising they would live together in London. Then he took it even further.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1996, Murphy disguised himself as a woman and kidnapped the child. He put him on a plane, flew him off to New York City, and kept him in a shared hotel room. The boy was only rescued when a hotel clerk saw their faces on America’s Most Wanted and called the cops.
....
Bob Villard was one of the biggest child managers in the industry. He represented some of the most famous young names in Hollywood, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire—but if the system had worked correctly, he would not have been allowed anywhere near any of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even before DiCaprio started acting, in 1987, Villard was charged with possession of child pornography. The prosecution, though, failed to prove it in court—and so Villard went free and kept working with kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            It took until 2001 before they got him in jail. Villard was caught with a whole collection of sexually explicit pictures of young boys. He lost the case, went to jail, and the world became a safer place—for a while anyway, until Villard got out and immediately went right back to managing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            It did not take long before Villard hurt someone. By 2005, he was caught sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy he had courted as a client. Villard was sent back behind bars and his career finally ended—but there is no telling how many other clients he may have assaulted that never came forward.

ven if you have not heard Bryan Singer’s name, odds are you have seen one of his movies. He is the director responsible for the X-Men movies, The Usual Suspects, and the alleged sexual assaults of at least three underage boys

Marc Collins-Rector Definitely Raped 15-Year-Old Michael Egan
           </p>
           <p>
            Martin Weiss Was Released as Soon as He Was Convicted
           </p>
           <p>
            Martin Weiss was a Hollywood manager who specialized in finding kids. He had his share of successes. Nickelodeon and Disney both used him as a talent scout and took on the kids that he found. The whole time, though, he was using his position to abuse children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weiss used his position to take advantage of 11-year-old Evan Henzi more than 30 times over a period of years. It took until Henzi was 14 to work up the courage to press charges. Weiss pled no contest and was sentenced to one year in jail—but, since he had served the prison time while he was waiting for his trial date, he was released as soon as he was convicted.
           </p>

            A Nickelodeon Production Assistant Used His Job to Assault Children
           </p>
           <p>
            handy-mugS
           </p>
           <p>
            Jason Michael Handy describes himself as a “pedophile, full-blown.” That, though, did not stop him from taking a job at Nickelodeon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Handy used his position to lure children. In 2004, he contacted a 14-year-old girl over the internet, introduced himself as a Nickelodeon producer, and promised her a television career. The lure of stardom was enough to get the young girl to give up anything—and so she let him fly all the way to Michigan, where he met her at her school.
           </p>
           <p>
            When he was arrested for molestation, the police found a cache of child porn in his home. They also found out that he had been volunteering at the local church so he could prey on the children there, too.

            Woody Allen Allegedly Raped His Seven-Year-Old Daughter
           </p>
           <p>
            But these stories are not just limited to production assistants. Some of the biggest names in cinema have been accused of pedophilia. The worst of all has to be Woody Allen—who was accused of raping his own daughter.
           </p>
           <p>
            “When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house. He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother’s electric train set,” Allen’s daughter, Dylan Farrow, claims. “Then he sexually assaulted me.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Farrow took her father to court for it, but she was not able to prove it. The judges, though, ruled that “the best interests of these children would be served by remaining together in the custody of Ms. Farrow” instead of Allen. He even forbid Allen from visiting his children.
           </p>
           <p>
            It does not help Allen’s case that he married his adoptive stepdaughter. Nor does it help that his own son, Ronan Farrow, also thinks he did it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Singer was not the only person at these parties. They were held by Marc Collins-Rector, the owner of a media company called DEN. Collins-Rector hired Egan as an actor, and he was the one who invited him.
           </p>
           <p>
            At these parties, according to Egan, adult men floated drugs and alcohol to teenaged boys, and used them for sex. Not only were they underage, but it was not always consensual. Egan claims that Collins-Rector pinned him down and violently sexually abused him, in one case holding a gun to his head and threatening to shoot him if he did not stop resisting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Egan did not just file charges against Singer. He filed them against Marc Collins-Rector and two of his associates as well—as did several other boys. One of those boys, incidentally, was Alexander Burton, who was given the role of Pyro in Bryan Singer’s X-Men.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the charges came in, Collins-Rector fled the country. He ran as fast as he could so that he would never have to meet his accusers in court. The boys were awarded $4.5 million—and, when the police finally found Collins-Rector, he confessed to five charges of sexually assaulting minors.
Disney Hired Convicted Child Molester Brian Peck
           </p>
           <p>
            Marc Collins-Rector is not even the only convicted pedophile associated with Singer. There is also Brian Peck, who played a minor role in Singer’s X-Men. Singer cast Peck again in X-Men 2—which was a strange choice for a movie about gifted youngsters. After all, between the two movies, Peck went to jail for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peck also worked as a dialogue coach, often working with companies like Nickelodeon to coach child actors. He spent 6 months having a sexual affair with an unnamed child actor on Amanda Bynes’ The Amanda Show until the family charged him with sexual assault in 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peck, though, got out of jail and went right back to work. And it was not just Bryan Singer who hired him—Disney hired the convicted child molester, back on his old job, to work as a dialogue coach on The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Corey Haim Was Allegedly Raped on the Set of Lucas
           </p>
           <p>
            After Corey Haim died, his friend Corey Feldman became one of the most outspoken actors willing to talk about pedophilia in Hollywood. The two Coreys were famous for being abused. In the words of Little House on The Prairie star Alison Arngrim, “Everybody knew that the two Coreys were just being passed around.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Roman Polanski’s sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey is one of the best-known Hollywood scandals
           </p>
           <p>
            Polanski fed the 13-year-old Gailey Quaaludes and alcohol, and sexually assaulted her inside of Jack Nicholson’s home. Gailey, according to her testimony yelled, “No, keep away!” and “Stop it!” while Polanski forcibly sodomized her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Polanski was found guilty, but he fled the country to avoid jail time

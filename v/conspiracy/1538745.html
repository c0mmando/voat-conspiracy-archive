             I don't disagree, I just find it discouraging sometimes.  I thought for some reason that /pol/ had temporarily escaped that plague which claimed /b/ so long ago.  It makes me worry for the future when I see the same pattern happen yet again.

             Mods with an agenda of some type dominate a social media platform.  Enforce draconian rules to split the community up.  Community winds up leaving in droves to other sites, which remain fractured as much smaller groups until they in turn grow in size and the process repeats itself over again.  It happens with all the big platforms.  Sometimes I wonder if there's just an agenda somewhere to keep the common people from ever really uniting in large scale for much of anything.

            This is in line with the recent complete deletion of the 'Right Wing Safety Squad' threads that were subsequently moved onto 8chan.  The concept was fairly simple, after the Oakland fire that took the lives of 50 some odd leftists, other leftists called for help.  And by golly, /pol/ was there to do so for a few days before the mods/admin forced it completely offsite.  It was actually pretty funny.  Basically reprehensibly unsafe warehouses with bad electrical wiring and other unsafe conditions... essentially death traps waiting to happen again just like in Oakland, where leftists congregated to plot protests against Trump and all their antifa activities were reported to various fire departments and whatnot.  People talked about it, memes were done, it was something that really took off.  Lots of very unsafe places were shut down, and those leftists were forced to go back to their families and away from their cults, it was a lot of winning going on through and through.

            Now that background is out of the way, this thread that I'm posting about here is in response to what those 4 niggers did in Chicago to that white guy.  Same sort of principle, going after criminals this time though instead and actually cleaning up America's streets...?  Again, knocked down, pruned/deleted and I'm willing to bet money that the OP was banned from the site, much like what happened to the previous ones.

            Overall, shills are out in extreme force regularly there, but it's the moderation that I'm really starting to notice and trying to watch.  There have been some screen shots circulating about a 'modbro' around hatechan's leftypol that has managed to take over and has been working hard on subverting the board.  The sheer volume of obvious shills is a little disconcerting.  I want to advertise voat, but we have so many refugees here already I'm not sure I want to hint at a bastion for them for fear of even more shills being lured here.

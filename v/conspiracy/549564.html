<p>But for 5-year-old Sophie, <strong>the moment unfolded as perfectly as it was scripted by members of a coalition of Los Angeles-based immigration rights groups.</strong> They had been preparing for nearly a year for the young girl from suburban Los Angeles to make a dash for the popemobile to deliver a message about the plight of immigrant parents living in the country illegally.</p>
<p><strong>They had even pulled off a similar public-relations coup a year ago in Rome using a 10-year-old girl with the pope.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;We planned to do this from the moment we learned he was coming to the States,&quot; Juan Jose Gutierrez of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition told The Associated Press. &quot;We have been working for a while now trying to sensitize the American public that dealing with immigration</strong> is not just dealing with the people who came in without proper documents but that we also have ... countless children whose parents are undocumented.&quot;</p>
<p>Gutierrez said the group decided to use the children of immigrants to represent their push for immigration reforms to the pope, a staunch supporter of immigrants. &quot;We have been looking for children to make the case that we as adults have been making for years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sophie was selected for the Washington trip because she &quot;impressed us all so much that we felt she would be our best spokesman,&quot; Gutierrez said. If she had been unsuccessful in Washington attracting the pope\'s attention, he said, she would have traveled with the group to New York and then Philadelphia to try again.</p>
<p>Here\'s her statement the media ate up.  
</p>
<p>&quot;I believe I have the right to live with my parents,&quot; Sophie told the AP after her moment with the pope. &quot;I have the right to be happy. My dad works very hard in a factory galvanizing pieces of metal. All immigrants just like my dad feed this country. They deserve to live with dignity. They deserve to live with respect.&quot;</p>
<p>Not coached at all to say that as that\'s what a normal statement for 5 year old girls.  The immigrant activist believes so.  <strong>&quot;She didn\'t have anyone coaching her,&quot; Gutierrez said. &quot;She just spoke from her heart. It all came from her.&quot;</strong></p>',

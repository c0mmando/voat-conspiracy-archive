             You're right. I think the company entertainment insiders would like to cover for CNN, but if this rises to the board of directors level, guys like Stankey won't be able to do anything to prevent the overhaul.

              Inside of a major buy like this John would be in the middle of it.  He's probably watching reports and seeing how it goes.  I've been reading a couple of examples of how the guy operates as he's in charge of direct TV I'm guessing that he's either happy that viacom is taking a dip and will be easier to buy, or is discouraged because he would not be able to recover the damage to the brand.  Who knows.

            You can bet that there is a lot of discussion going on behind closed doors on this. I don't believe they will fire Zucker right away because that would just inflame an already bad situation. But if the race toward the bottom accelerates, they won't have any choice but to step in and make some adjustments.

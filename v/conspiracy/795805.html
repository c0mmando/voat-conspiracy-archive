            True. They are all extremely greedy and selfish, which is both their collective strength and their collective weakness, in that it creates an inability to cooperate unless it results in profit or power gains. Very transparent and one-dimensional. Also very predictable. They're always backstabing at the drop of a hat in the end, which makes the hierarchy like the pile of sand at the bottom of the hourglass, it's always changing and getting shuffled around as it grows, but it's still actually there despite the volatility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Changing the culture in exactly the right direction removes the hierarchy, just as scooping out the base of the sand pyramid will cause it to fall flat

            Your version sounds like a movie. I don't think there will be a "day" that comes, I think it'll be a gradual process that'll take a couple of decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the fed raised the interest rate to cause the crash. They know it's a bubble, and they can control when they pop it. They're choosing now, because they want to pass the TPP. I think it's that simple.

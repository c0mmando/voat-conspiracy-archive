<p>Introduced in House (04/05/2017)
Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act of 2017</p>
<p>This bill amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to provide that the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism shall have the rank of ambassador and be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p>The Special Envoy shall: (1) be a person of recognized distinction in the field of combating anti-Semitism or religious freedom; (2) serve as the primary advisor to, and coordinate efforts across, the U.S. government relating to monitoring and combating anti-Semitism and anti-Semitic incitement in foreign countries; and (3) report directly to the Secretary of State.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goats, this bill already passed the congressional vote with overwhelming support and is going to the Senate then TRUMP, then law.  While you all have your panties in a bunch from the wave of the Q believers, let\'s not let them sneak this past us.  
</p>
<p>If this law passes, nearly every American goat on this site, is going to be prosecuted under federal law from even half the shit we say.  <strong>Naming the Jew will be illegal.</strong>  This is the very definition of what the right to free speech brings, the right to name the jew, the black, the white, the whatever the fuck you want to name.  It clearly states, Trump will name the individual who will serve as the Judge/Jury/Executioner.  He has sent more money than any American President to Israel to continue their reign of terror.  He will take away our right to free speech, now is not the time to wait.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is your right as a human but in law, it\'s the right of EVERY AMERICAN to say what the fuck you want to say and to whom.  They will make it illegal for SPEAKING.  think about this, fuck all this media bullshit, this is the real fucking news.</p>

             violence is never the answer in my opinion.  In fact, that is exactly what it appears they want, for a war to break out so they can cry a foul that they are being persecuted again.

              Yeah I thought violence wasn't the answer for a long time, but it is part of life. The tiger rips apart the throat of its prey. They also fight to defend their territory. I think the pacifist view is intended to weaken and lower the West's defenses.
             </p>
             <p>
              They do seem very much to want another world war, but I'm alluding to 'rendering ineffective' the very people that are creating the climate for the next war. They have been murdering our key personnel for centuries, and now they've got us on the ropes. If many of these criminals were put out of action, their plans would be disrupted. Instead, we keep trying to tiptoe around, obeying the rules that the criminals have set! Peace through strength.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just an opinion, but it seems like we're playing a tennis match by the rules, but they ignore the rules and come out victorious. I mean, they've been kicked out hundreds of times, and still come back to control the world.

            2% of the US population needs severe protection because it will be very fucking obvious if you name all the Jews that they are stacked all over in key decision making positions. US better wake the fuck up and for fucks sakes stop cutting off  parts of your dicks. Like the Jews, USA is becoming a parasite to the world.

            this bill creates some kind of anti-semitism monitor. but i fail to see in it where it provides for the punishment and prosecution of said anti-semitism. dont get me wrong, im very oposed to this bill. but not quite sure how it alone is going to get me arrested for anti-semitism.

             I see that it is misleading.   I should mention that this is the prelude to that happening.  Step 1 was the state department defining 'Anti-Semitism' | Step 2 begin passing legislation making anti-semitism a hate crime = see south carolina | step 3 push this to federal level and create an 'Independent council' who gets to watch dog this = come on.... Step 4 | making it federal law that 'anti-semistism' is a hate crime = bad news for american voaters

            If you give a shit about free speech at all. You will do whatever you can to fight anything that even remotely resembles this. This is blatantly against the first amendment. We cannot allow outlawing of speech, it can and will be used to outlaw other speech.

             Yeah, it's probably more impactful than people are understanding here.  This is a gateway policy, created in order to make the jew untouchable even in thought.  This is not the first or only place and time they've done this. Look at Germany.  They placed the same policies in effect there, a little at a time, and now no one is able to even understand that their 'happy merchant friend' and the jew that's selling their neighbor's kid to the Muslims to be eaten are the same people.

              Just out of curiosity, what exactly would be the point of this bill if it wasn't headed in the direction of punishing those who express anti semitic views? Full disclosure I haven't read the full text of the bill but I did look at the summary and it seems like a push to limit speech to me.

               All the bill does is upgrade a position to ambassadorship. No investigatory powers in an ambassadorship. No executive/prosecutorial powers in an ambassadorship.

               If anything, it gives him the power to advise the president on who is a jew-hater. I'd love to have one of those on my team, so I could locate legitimate jew-haters and assist them in their activities. I'd like to have a similar position for Tranny-haters, if I could get away with it. As long as I was in power, it'd be used for keeping the frogs straight, to invert an AlexJones-ism.

                Why would they upgrade that kind of a position like that? It doesn't make a ton of sense if you ask me. It would only make sense if more is coming. See if you can get away with this and then try the next step. Perhaps I'm wrong and I sincerely hope that I am but it wouldn't seem to be a good thing.

             that is far from true - the internet hub is in france, so this gives this 'Committee' the ability to watchdog the american internet.  what do they say, chess not checkers.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "(1) Acts of anti-Semitism in countries throughout the world, including some of the world's strongest democracies, have increased significantly in frequency and scope over the last several years.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(2) During the last 3 months of 2003 and the first 3 months of 2004, there were numerous instances of anti-Semitic violence around the world, including the following incidents:
            </p>
            <p>
             "(A) In Putrajaya, Malaysia, on October 16, 2003, former Prime Minister Mahatir Mohammad told the 57 national leaders assembled for the Organization of the Islamic Conference that Jews 'rule the world by proxy', and called for a 'final victory' by the world's 1.3 billion Muslims, who, he said, 'cannot be defeated by a few million Jews.'.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(B) In Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, simultaneous car bombs exploded outside two synagogues filled with worshippers, killing 24 people and wounding more than 250 people.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(C) In Australia on January 5, 2004, poison was used to ignite, and burn anti-Semitic slogans into, the lawns of the Parliament House in the state of Tasmania.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(D) In St. Petersburg, Russia, on February 15, 2004, vandals desecrated approximately 50 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery, painting the stones with swastikas and anti-Semitic graffiti.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(E) In Toronto, Canada, over the weekend of March 19 through March 21, 2004, vandals attacked a Jewish school, a Jewish cemetery, and area synagogues, painting swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans on the walls of a synagogue and on residential property in a nearby, predominantly Jewish, neighborhood.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(F) In Toulon, France, on March 23, 2004, a Jewish synagogue and community center were set on fire.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(3) Anti-Semitism in old and new forms is also increasingly emanating from the Arab and Muslim world on a sustained basis, including through books published by government-owned publishing houses in Egypt and other Arab countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(4) In November 2002, state-run television in Egypt broadcast the anti-Semitic series entitled 'Horseman Without a Horse', which is based upon the fictitious conspiracy theory known as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols have been used throughout the last century by despots such as Adolf Hitler to justify violence against Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-Semitic series, entitled 'Ash-Shatat' (or 'The Diaspora'), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for Jewish control of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(7) The OSCE convened a conference again on April 28–29, 2004, in Berlin, to address the problem of anti-Semitism with the United States delegation led by former Mayor of New York City, Ed Koch.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(8) The United States Government has strongly supported efforts to address anti-Semitism through bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the United Nations.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on the Department of State to thoroughly document the phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
             "(10) Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel."

            hate crimes dont exist. no one gets special protected status. law should not recognize any group as less or more protected. if we are to be free as a people, justice must be blind. this law would be the final signal that those that aim to rule over us feel threatened.

             I'm remaining optimistic about this because I have to be, but there is no possible way Trump could tell Israel to go fuck itself right off the bat. The AIPAC, ACLU, SPLC, etc. has so much power, money and influence in our government right now. The list of government officials who are dual citizens in Israel is staggering. It's no mystery where their loyalties lie. Trump has to play ball with them for now, otherwise he'd get fucked six ways to Sunday. The coziness with Netanyahu and the massive amounts of funds for their military spending keeps the Neocon Jew off his ass while he deals with the Neolib Jew trying to take him down. This isn't going to be an easy war to win, and it's going to take years to undo the damage that's been done. We can't fight the war on both fronts.

              I want to know why so many in the congress have duel citizenship with Israel. They are not all Jewish. POTUS or Q or Qanon keeps referring to Israel being saved for last but that doesn't make since to me.Any idea what that's about. Keep in mind I don't know much about Jew conspiracy and I don't want to read a bunch of books.

             Given all the 5d chess that has been going on lately, you would have to be an idiot president to not win favor of the jews early on. perhaps the pro Israel / anti islam thing is actually a really well thought out long term plan...

            The last thing anyone should do, is take a break from naming the Jew, while the Jew is trying to ban naming the Jew. Horrible advice.

            The question is : why is Trump so protective of Israel. Is it because of the primacy of Israel  in the End Times, or is it strictly political ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Future Prophecies
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Tribulation — God will put the Jewish people through an unparalleled period of tribulation (Deuteronomy 4:30), during which two-thirds of the Jews will perish (Zechariah 13:8-9). The purpose will be to soften the hearts of a remnant so that they will accept Jesus as their Messiah.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Salvation — A remnant of the Jews will “look upon Him whom they have pierced” and will accept Him as Lord and Savior (Zechariah 12:10; Romans 11:1-6,25-29).
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Primacy — God will then regather all the believing Jews to Israel where they will be established as the prime nation in the world during the millennial reign of Jesus. (See Deuteronomy 28:1,13; 2 Samuel 7:9; Isaiah 60-62; Micah 4:1-7.)

            Unconstitutional. SC ruled that hate speech is protected speech. I may not agree with what you say, but I'll fight to the death your right to say it. Hate speech that incites violence is not protected speech.

             Define incites violence. At the moment anything that you say that is against the narrative is called violence by the AntiFA types and increasingly by the rest of the evil cabal.
            </p>
            <p>
             The right to free speech includes the right to call for violence. In fact that may be its most important function.

               bill is about upgrading the position to ambassadorship
              </a>
              , your "five eyes" narrative is hillariously wrong. Making a position into an ambassadorship should have ZERO bearing on our ability to share intelligence information with other countries. This ambassadorship
              <em>
               isn't even related to intelligence sharing
              </em>
              , so imagine me pointing and laughing at you for being this retarded and getting 10 upvoats by other retards that also didn't read the bill.

             No, it would not survive the supreme court. They know as well as every Constitution-loving American knows that the moment they step out of bounds to not enforce the Constitutional rights of every American, the moment they try to impede on the right to free speech, then the immediate response will likely be to see them hanged for treason in committing tyranny. They sure as Hell won't be safe, there would be sudden and immediate empty seats among the supreme court branches following their deaths.

Congress finds that since the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004 was enacted, in many foreign countries acts of anti-Semitism have been frequent and wide in scope, the perpetrators and variety of threats to Jewish communities and their institutions have proliferated, and in some countries anti-Semitic attacks have increased in frequency, scope, violence, and deadliness.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Where is their proof, their evidence for citation? Muslims? Mosques? Oh yes, the Goyim know well about these, they'll pass such a legislation no problem!
              </p>
              <p>
               As far as I've seen Muslims have only ever fucking attacked white people and have been covered up for by the Media, they have no evidence for citation to enact such a bill or even to support it. Let's put it this way, it will not survive the Supreme Court because the Constitution is against it. They have no proof or evidence for citation that Jews have faced any such acts of violence in America, the bill is unnecessary and pointless. It'll be slapped down regardless. America is not Germany or any other country in Europe where they don't have a bill of Constitutional rights to guarantee them the freedom of speech. America on the other hand, does. Americans don't have to worry about this, you're distracted by something this trivial? Get a grip.
              </p>
              <p>
               It will not survive the supreme court, that I can guarantee. What you should be more focused on is keeping tabs on all of the Congress &amp; Senate representatives that sign in support of the legislation and vote them the fuck out.

                Good lord, child. Most people would stop and think about what they were doing when they were shown that the bill didn't do what it said it did.

                You, however, doubled the fuck down on it. Is this your first time reading a bill? The preamble and justification is great when judges need to interpret a law, but here's the thing:

                 Also, the question shouldn't be about whether it would survive the supreme court, or how it gets twisted into meaning that someone would be arrested for wrong-think for naming the Jew or that it's  infringing on the Constitution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In the first place the question should be, "why should anyone be granted the title of ambassador for something as stupid as anti-Semitism?"
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sounds like that Team America World Police bullshit all over again if you ask me.

                   But if I'm not mistaken, they're given Diplomatic Immunity if I remember correctly. This more or less sounds to me like the operations targets will all always be in countries other than America's, the way it's worded I can't imagine it being granted for any matters concerning affairs in America. At least it doesn't sound that way unless I'm missing something in the way it's worded in the bill.

                    You're not missing anything. All diplomatic immunity means is that they won't be prosecuted if they gun-down a schoolyard of kids in a foreign country.

                 Well both questions I don't know. I was just answering how I think it's stupid to think that it means what OP was suggesting, and responded to how the other person asking a question in the thread if it would survive the supreme court, which that response was a "no".

             Interestingly, the SCOTUS voted 9-0 recently that “hate speech” does not exist, by law. However, this is about jews, so they’ll likely vote 9-0 that it does.

               a faggot. I guess I focused too much on the "movement in that direction." Another "jew protection scheme" should be a concern and receive push back, but fake info doesn't help, and probably hurts.

              Never heard of that one before. The Black race gets a bad rap because of all the niggers. Black people I respect like any other human on Earth. I've got no time for niggers.

                 The collapse of civilization is complete. The purchasing power of the US dollar is worth three cents, compared to the dollar of 1913. Taxes? Where do we start. ✡Income tax✡, which exists solely to pay for the existence of the Federal Reserve–taxes going to the pockets of private individuals for the ‘privilege’ of printing worthless currency. An unconstitutional marxist welfare state to steal more income from the working and give it to the lazy, the nonwhites, and the foreigners. Endless war solely for the sake of other nations with no annexations or financial benefits for the US, wasting trillions in taxes and tens of thousands of lives. All laws, everywhere, at every level, are completely ignored by the government. The governing class is universally guilty of multiple felonies, and at least half of whom are guilty of outright treason. Genocidal invasion from the third world. Rape, murder, theft, etc. running rampant throughout once-safe streets as niggers and dune coons reap the fruits of their invasion. Terrorist attacks against people who are imprisoned for fighting back against the terrorists. Faggots and trannies holding parades where they spew their juices riddled with incurable STDs all over the streets. You get fired from your job or arrested if you so much as disagree with this shit. And gun confiscations from actual citizens so they can’t even defend themselves against any of it or reverse it. NOT THAT THEY EVER WILL. And that’s the problem. One hundred fucking years of this. Never stopping, never slowing. And what have the people done? NOTHING.
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1913 when the US stopped using gold and silver as money and started using private paper currency.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1917 when the jew puppet Wilson said, “We’re going to war for the Europeans and getting nothing out of it in return.”
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1920 when jewish feminists brainwashed men into granting women the vote, setting a deadline on the collapse of our nation at no later than 2020 (every single civilization in human history that enfranchised women fell within 100 years).
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1933 when FDR unconstitutionally made “owning gold” illegal.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1934 when the National Firearms Act unconstitutionally banned the ownership of weapons.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1935 when the marxist Social Security Act was passed, nor during any of other FDR’s illegal acts.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1941 when the jew puppet FDR said, “We’re going to war for the Europeans, again, and getting nothing out of it in return, again.”
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1946 when Bretton Woods was signed.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up against any of the proxy wars in the Cold War (which gave our nation absolutely nothing–no annexed land, no reparations, and we paid to rebuild our enemies).
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1965 when the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act openly committed genocide on Americans. The politicians admitted it. No one did anything.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1968 when the Civil Rights Act unconstitutionally destroyed freedom of association.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1973 when Roe v. Wade legalized murder of the innocent.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up after all the contra deals in the 1980s showed the US was deposing democracies and installing dictators.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 1990 when the first Gulf War began the march for Greater Israel.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 2001 after 9/11 when jews false flagged the US yet again for Greater Israel.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 2003 when the Second Gulf War was declared. Nor when it was proven the war was carried out under false pretenses. Nor when any of the post-Cold War wars STILL failed to get us land or reparations, and we paid TRILLIONS MORE to rebuild our enemies.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 2008 when the economy collapsed and the banks were given trillions of dollars to give bonuses to their executives who caused it.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  They didn’t rise up in 2015 when faggot “marriage” became “legal.”

You're not doing anything about it other than reposting tired old textwall rants from the comfort and convenience of your home computer, yet you give other people shit for apparently doing no less.

                    I admitted no such thing, or anything, for that matter. Meanwhile, here you are doubling down on your hypocrisy, proving exactly my point, with exactly the hypocritical tactics that I called you out for.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    OK Mr. Copypasta Hypocrite, when and where did I suggest that people had never been arrested in the United States for speech? And where did you prove that anyone had been? Also, do you not understand the difference between being arrested for something, being prosecuted for something, and being convicted for something. People get arrested for stuff all the time that they are never prosecuted or convicted for.

            This will destroy America if it passes.  It won't be called a free speech issue but a hate crime one that will be expanded out to Muslims and niggers too and the second someone accepts their sentence it'll set precedence.

            Your post really needs to be pinned so everyone here can see it and then we need to avoid talking about the jews at first so as to not turn normies off.  We could for example talk about how once the jews claim special status every race and religion will want their cut so for instance when the blacks start looting stores we could be arrested for laughing about how they took all the air jordans but left the work shoes behind.  If it's ever thrown back on the kikes instead of going full red pill we could just say that they're really over represented in banking, wall street and finance in general and are probably just looking for a way to throw dissenters in prison while they fuck us all over, money controls politics after all and then change to saying we could also go to prison for saying that muslims worship a pedo or that they throw gays off roof tops.  We need to stress that it's not a hate crime to point out actual issues even if they have some kind of race or religion in common but those with a vested interest in keeping us blind from the reality around would make it so to crush us into submission.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's probably also a good time to save all the memes we can.  Bitcoin be damned, if this shit passes rare pepes are going to be the currency of the future.

              I know the kikes have earned being exiled nearly 360 times, that the holocaust is a lie, that they've weaponized the lesser races and our own media against us, etc. but if you start off carrying on like that normies are going to think you're a straight up nazi and think this law a good thing to pass.  You need to ease them into it by calling them bankers, wall street investors, etc. and say that they're using money like a weapon to get themselves richer at everyone else's expense and are trying to use that money to make it impossible to criticize them by buying off politicians that will make it against the law to do so.  Then you bring in the other races like I mentioned with niggers leaving work boots but shooting each other over the last pair of air jordans during natural disasters and say that it will be a criminal offense to point that out too as it would be considered a hate crime to point out how it's only shit skins that are looting and the fact they've no intention to earn an honest days pay.
             </p>
             <p>
              You make it a case of pointing out facts that would used to be known as stereotyping people which when based upon observation is merely factual and not a racial issue.  You ask them why someone would want to hide the truth like that, who is behind the bill, etc. and when it comes back to being about the jews eventually people are going to feel ok with stereotyping them again and that's when the memes will flow making it normal to shit on them in the open.  We'll see people sharing videos on themselves rubbing their hands together saying shut it down, people shitting on the holohoax numbers as being impossible, everyone finally seeing their influence in the media, etc. and that's when we go red suppository on the normies to the point no one wants to do business with jews, they're not allowed dual citizenship and eventually they're all forced on welfare and living next door to tyrone in section 8 housing or they fuck off to israel.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wish we could just shoot them all, women and children included because after all baby spiders still grow up to be spiders, but having them mocked, losing all their money, losing all their power and influence, etc. would be glorious all the same and if this law passes because the public only sees us as screeching nazi's that would be really shitty to say the least.  I don't want to see them or anyone else a protected class of people but if we go all holobunga on the normies from the get go that's exactly what's going to happen.

                I don't know about you but I've actually tried that in real life.  I sat there and forced people to search for shit themselves in front of me so they knew I wasn't bullshitting them and the more I went on the more it turned them off.  NPCs do not like going to any effort and when it goes against their condition they'll try to fight it.  I've seen plenty of people recoil like I just took a shit in their hands only to come back and say it doesn't matter what their religion is.  Only once did a guy actually manage to make it past that point and let me continue and I honestly think it was because I was the one shouting drinks that night as he was poor as fuck and hadn't been drunk in weeks.  To his credit though he actually saw the light but just like the forgetful jew who acknowledged your point the day prior he had seemingly completely forgotten the next day.  I could see it in his eyes that he remembered but his feelings of racism and white guilt stopped him from letting it bubble to the surface.  I tried with him again and again with everything from niggers to muslims to how we're all enslaved by modern society and money in particular and it all clicked and then rolled off like water off a duck's back.  Just like Shia le poof he couldn't admit it while sober but privately put a few drinks into him and he was all nods, agreement and even chipping in to help confirm the red pills.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think we need to take a lessen from the jews with their push for multiculturalism in that too fast and the public will put an end to it but a slow enough drip won't have them notice until it's already too late.  I know I didn't want to believe in the child sacrifices, literally worshiping satan, white genocide, etc. but once I took all the other red pills about the jews I was all too happy to look into those too as I was already past the point of no return.  But hey you go right ahead and go balls to the wall from the get go.  Just like the swastika you'll know exactly who shares your ideals and who's going to pussy out when the getting gets tough.  Just know that if societal conversion is your aim that most are so blue pilled that even when they know you have everyone's best interests at heart that they'll fight tooth and nail against you.  WWII was nothing compared to the fight that would go up against outright Nazi idealism today but given a slow creep we can get everyone on our side and maybe even eventually exterminate the jewish menace once and for all.

                 It's not our duty to enlighten the NPCs. Anyone who isn't redpilled on the JQ by 2018 is either very young or extremely oblivious, and trying to educate them is a waste of time. The only way to fight is for a few of us to accumulate power level to that of the jews, the first step being to form underground societies and institutions. From there, we will amass huge capital and challenge their authority.

               all jews are not a part of this evil man, it's just impossible. zionist and their sympathizers, that's the problem.  Q has pretty much hammered it home to us that the rothschilds rockerfellers , msm and the liberal parties are the core of the evil that has ruined the world. Q tells us to dig into these people and their connections. well that totally leads to zionst jews everytime evrywhere. never fails. it's painfully evident to me Q is trying to wake up the world to jewish trickery and the evil they have done. but a jew who is unaffiliated with zionism is most likely just as lost as the rest of the world is.

               Ah, when shown to be COMPLETELY WRONG, the kid with the fragile ego doubles-down on his fear, in the form of a slippery slope fallacy, in order to shake that pesky congnitive dissonance he's experiencing.

              <p>
               This Ambassadorship upgrade does nothing. He has no investigatory powers. he has no prosecutorial powers. He's a fucking
               <em>
                ambassador
               </em>
               now. That's it. Your goalpost move to "WHAT IF ANOTHER BILL HAPPUNS?" is an exercise in fantasy, unless it
               <em>
                explicitly grants this ambassadorship powers outside his normal scope

            There's nothing in this that adds new criminal offenses people can be prosecuted under.  It may allow for intrusive investigation of those who say anything bad about jews though.

              So, there's no evidence that this actually makes naming the jew illegal, but everyone's resorting to a "slippery slope" fallacy in order to cover up that there's nothing here to freak out about.

              More "official" reasons to meddle in other countries if you're correct. "Fighting anti-semitism abroad" was likely one of the catchphrases used to bring the US into WW2. Any legislature that helps the Jews/Israel adds legal precedent and puts us deeper in their pockets, thus harder to climb out.

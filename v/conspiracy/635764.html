           What Europe's leaders are doing to their citizens just goes against any common sense.

            You are right.  It doesn't make any sense at all.  It's like the leaders of Europe are intentionally trying to destroy their nation and culture.  Do they really need young workers from the Middle East?  Greece, Spain, Portugal, France, and the slavic nations all have unemployment greater than 10%--some are over 20%--and youth unemployment at 40% among the native populations.  They could've encourage migration within the EU.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe, the leaders know that an economic collapse is coming--they need to distract the public.  Bring in some immigrants that the native populations can hate on.

            The way I see it, sorta kinda.  There is a push from the U.N. (Agenda 21) to get all populations into dense urban centers.  They'll have to step up policing once that starts to happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other "reasons" for the mass immigration.  German leaders keep decrying a coming population crisis with lots of people retiring soon but not enough people will remain in the population poool to fill the gaps.  I believe it's a crock of shit because economies adapt to changes like this.  It's epsecially a bad argument when you consider European (and US) high unemployment.

            Could be a Hijrah (a holy calling to invade and convert foreign countries to Islam through migration).  Could be Russia/China pushing migrants into Europe to destroy their economies from within a la the classic war strategy by Sun Tzu; flood your enemy with migrants, watch their country collapse, go in with your army to clean up the mess.
           </p>
           <p>
            But my best guess, just watching MSM and things like the latest Dr. Who, which so unskillfully alluded to the Islam invasion, that the major powers in the West are encouraging this migration for two fold reasons.  First to justify the police state thats coming.  And second to peg a radical "conservative" group to prevent cultural back swing from the hard push to the left.  Historically when a culture gets pushed to far left or right, there is a back swing and the culture suddenly and rapidly snaps to the other extreme i.e. Liberal 1930's Germany leading to National Socialism.  Islam has been brought in this time to have the "conservative" movement already pegged.  That way when the "terrorists" arrive they can use the new police state to crack down on true patriotic conservatives who may interfere with the overall plans.
           </p>
           <p>
            I call it "The Big Squeeze."  The elites are essentially pushing hard left to create a backswing effect.  Then they place a "wall" in the way and the whole civilization comes crashing hard into the wall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Essentially civilization, you and me, have been deemed the biggest threat to the elites and that threat outweighs our usefulness in their eyes. Thus they have agreed to try to eliminate that threat.

             I don't think you can accuse Russia or China since the push for more immigration is coming from Europe's leaders.  Germany's Merkel practically told people in the Middle East and Africa to come to Germany regardless of a need for political asylum.  Did Europe invite Iraqi refugees during the decade we spent in Iraq destroying the country?   I just don't know where this sudden generosity and concern for Middle Eastern and African immigrants is coming from.  Germany has no homeless and social problems that they can address first?  Yet they are going to waste their government surpluses and then borrow money so they can put up homeless shelters for 25-30 year old single men throughout Germany?  Single men will want women to fuck.  Where are these women going to come from when 80% of the immigrants are single men?  Is this another conspiracy?  Is this Europe's way to combat the shrinking population growth?  By bringing in male Muslim and African breeders because European men have been so emasculated over the decades that they fear pussy?

            I don't know, but that sounds like a hell of an conspiracy. I hadn't thought of that.

             It worked so well in the U.S.  After the 9/11 attack, someone in government was shrewd enough to capitalize on the fear and released Anthrax from a U.S. bioweapons lab at Fort Detrick, a U.S. Army base.  Anthrax letters reading "Death to Israel...Death to USA".

              leaks to the media about bentonite in the Anthrax which could have only come from Iraq

             .  How could you not want to kill all Muslims?  Oh yeah, Patriot Act so we'll never be caught off guard again.  The terrorist attacks would never have happened via Facebook and Twitter (both est. in 2006), so I feel safe knowing the NSA looks at people's dog and cat pics.  ;)

             I'm sure European leaders noticed that.  It's not like the leaders and the one-percenters will suffer any consequences from the flood of immigrants.  In fact, it provides them with a cheap labor pool and significantly lowers labor costs.

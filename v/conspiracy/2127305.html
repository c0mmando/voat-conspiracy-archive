            If you think secret cloning technology that either a) quickly ages the clone to age 70, or b) existed decades ago, is more probable than padding and makeup on a person acting as a body-double then you have no idea how probability works.

            while I don't doubt that govt has tech they wont share for one reason or another, I have a real hard time absorbing the idea of a clone.  shes 70 years old. if her clones are too then that suggests perfect cloning was done in 1950.
           </p>
           <p>
            and no, i wont buy into the concept of faster aging or growing in a test tube or whatever.  shes still alive and yes, she is part of a major distraction.  but a clone?  no.

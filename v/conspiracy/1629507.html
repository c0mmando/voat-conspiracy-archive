            I'm fairly convinced that he, along with AL Queda and ISIS were fabricated to perpetuate the CIA and shadow governments war against all countries working against their global financial ambitions via the IMF and associated central banks. Oil is just one of their "products", but so are young humans apparently.

            I believe they have been brought down, stopped - based on many many hours of research - and a partial disclosure seems to be emerging.

            For hundreds of years, our ancestors were suppressed, technologically but more importantly spiritually!
           </p>
           <p>
            No matter what happens (because there are many potential outcomes and future events that will confuse most people), know that virtually anything is possible. Energy repression systems are being dismantled and we will soon find ourselves in a star trek like civilization.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can communicate telepathically, but what you may be feeling recently relates to that. Once our co-creative consciousness truly awakens, we will likely find it quite easy to communicate with thought and literally ask for (and get) whatever we want.

<p>One example I see coming to fruition in our generation or the next is displayed in the following passage:</p>
<p>Revelation 13: 16-17</p>

<p>And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Christians are warned <strong>not</strong> to receive the mark throughout the book).</p>
<p>Now whether or not this mark will be implanted in the form of a chip is unknown, <em>but,</em> I truly hope the hundred or so people reading this keep the passage in the back of their minds. For if and when it does come true, you will know it was coming and will hopefully question your beliefs (or lack of). </p>
<p>The latter portion of this post was not intended and pretty much just spilled out. I know a lot of it seems far out but the truth of the matter is everything we\'ve been led to believe is fictitious. We\'re all on the the \'Truman Show,\' with demonic, vile human beings playing God. They will ultimately pay in the end, but until then it\'s key we remain vigilant. </p>
<p>Another random thought that came to mind.. With the inevitable confiscation of guns, I highly recommend everyone check out Pneumatic Rifle alternatives. It\'s only a matter of time before the government comes for those too, but there are plenty of options that will easily put an intruder down. If you can manage to buy one anonymously via cash (while it still exists), I highly recommend you do so. There will come a time when the government will forcefully disarm citizens owner by owner. The longer you remain off any \'lists,\' the better.</p>',

             Whose fought it? The media? News? Politicians? They all work for the same people you fucking moron. Trump's literally painted the way he is in media so they can hook faggots like you who are so stupid you think the government is your friend. You're a fucking mindless cuck, spreading your ass for politicians to stick their dicks in

              Correct.  Orchestrated by the establishment that Trump is not a part of.  ANTIFA is an old, international political thug force, used to intimidate rivals for the benefit of their globalist, commie flavored NWO,  establishment masters.

             <p>
              The internal emails that exposed the details of the DNC, and MSM collusion to build him up as a "pied piper" candidate to help him win the republican nomination, and then smear him into oblivion in order to grant Clinton an easy win, paint a very dfferent story from your imagination.  Particularly the worried musings of Bill Ivey.  The MSM was all in to help the DNC destroy Trump.  Which is really easy to understand why, when you see how many Clinton cronies are in lead positions throughout the MSM.

              This proves you are simply ignorant of the ACTUAL conspiracy ('s) exposed throughout the thousands of leaked emails.  You seem Keen to want to find a conspiracy.  Get to work reading all the stuff your leftard media outlets will never show you that was revealed 3 years ago through wikileaks.  You will then gain a true understanding of what the establishment is, and how they work, and how much they

             Couldn't agree more. 90% of the people I talk to in Canada believes he is a stupid racist, the other 10% understand MSM is constantly lying, but then they tell me that Trump is just the other side of the same coin and that he is the puppet of billiionnaires, or they tell me he is the puppet of elite jews. No. Obama was the other side of that coin with his "change". No. Trump is change. Trump doesn't play the NWO game. That's why they hate him.

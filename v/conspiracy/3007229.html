             Why is there so little traction on voat about the stupid moon landings?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nobody seems to care that there's so little evidence the damn thing happened, nor that going to the moon is substantially further than any other human in space by a distance of about 280,000 miles. Through the van allen belts which scientists are still saying is the greatest challenge facing us if we want to go further than about 500 miles.
            </p>
            <p>
             To which NASA responds that they destroyed the technology and it needs to be redeveloped. Despite the fact that we have the lunar module on display in museums and could just take a look at it for this space age shielding.

              Gave you an upvoat for both your post and your comment. I've been harping on exactly the points you mention for over ten years to anyone who will listen, and the best I get is eye rolls and the counter argument that something that big would be impossible to fake and keep a secret. That ain't necessarily true. There are some government secrets so vast it would make a skeptic's jaw drop that have been kept from the public for decades and we many never know a thing about them other than they seem to have happened or are happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who believes we "lost" the designs for all of the Apollo space craft, which had a computer system less sophisticated than a dollar store calculator, are are irrecoverable, just isn't thinking clearly. If we did it once, surely we could do it again.
             </p>
             <p>
              Did you know if you watch video of the astronauts on "the moon" and speed it up just a bit, it looks they're walking in earth gravity and looks very natural. I was 10 when Apollo 11 "landed", and I watched each and every landing after that, but I never thought, even then, that it looks like they were walking on a planet with 1/6 the gravity of earth.

               There's also a lack of good videos talking about it. Most of the videos come across like insane conspiracy jibberish in at least one way or another. There must be smart effective communicators out there somewhere who have figured this out. I watched a video of one of the space walks where the astronaut helmet turned. That's the only footage of any space helmet turning ever. The helmets don't turn!
              </p>
              <p>
               And that's just a space walk, why even fake that? I'm certain people have been in low earth orbit so why not actually just film a space walk? Have they done so many fakes they figured "fuck it"?

                My favorite documentary on the subject is "What Really Happened On The Moon?", which examines NASA's own footage for anomalies and shows there are dozens, even hundreds, of errors NASA made that are irreconcilable with what is purported to be video evidence of moon missions.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you can find "Kubrick's Odyssey" by Jay Weidner, it discusses a possible deal Kubrick may have made with the government to provide special effects of a "moon walk". He describes Kubrick having multiple screens of a light diffusive material sewn together to be used for background in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a technical he (or someone) appears to have done for the moonwalk sound stage.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, if you can find it, there's "Tank on the Moon", a documentary of the Soviets' expedition to send two rovers to the moon, which conducted analyses of soil and rock and even returned small samples back to earth, the first ACTUAL specimens of lunar material.

                 If you wanna play where's waldo one of the landing sites is apparently in this large detailed image of the lunar surface somewhere. It's from Lunokhod 1 wandering around up there and I'll be damned if I can't see it.

            I am by no means an anti-vaxxer. I believe in the power of vaccinations, but this is quite scary. I think serious vaccinations like pertussis and measles should be mandatory. But having said that, you should be entitled to state your reasons for not wanting a vaccine. I know some people legitimately have bad reactions to various vaccines, so they should be entitled to have their case heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're refusing to vaccinate your child or yourself for religious reasons or because you read on the Internet that it causes disabilities or alzheimer's, then you're an idiot. If you're working with children or the elderly, don't be an idiot and refuse to vaccinate yourself. Your immune system might be strong, but it doesn't mean everyone else's immune system is, you could be carrying something seriously deadly to other people around you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not saying that all vaccines are essential and important (I don't agree with flu shots), but we have to acknowledge there are some things out there that our immune systems cannot fight. Look to a time before vaccines existed, people used to die from the common cold. Can you imagine dying from a cold? People died from the plague. And while many of those deaths might be partially attributed to hygiene standards at the time, medical discoveries such as antibiotics arguably made us stronger, not weaker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the reason we need vaccines is because the nutritional value of our foods is nil, we're all malnourished. We're eating bad fats and sugars, but not getting the right things our bodies need to naturally give us a chance at defending ourselves. Instead of drinking water, we drink a 1 litre of diet soda and justify it purely based on the fact it is diet. Kind of ironic that a lot of people who are against vaccinations, probably have poor diets thus making themselves even larger targets for serious diseases.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look to Steve Jobs as an example. He is a classic case of someone who let his beliefs get in the way of common sense. He had a common form of pancreatic cancer with a high survival rate, he chose for belief reasons to fight it naturally and it killed him. Towards the end of his life, he tried to get treatment and it was too late. He actually said he regretted not getting treatment initially.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know there is this consensus the government is trying to "kill" and or "control" us through vaccines, but doing so through vaccinations would be the hardest path to take. Don't you realise they already control us by controlling the media, by enslaving us to a broken monetary system operated by an elite group of families, putting things into our water supply, our food (corn syrup, Monsanto) and through the internet? They don't need to add vaccines into the mix, they already control us.

             That is a personal attack, and I don't like those, especially in a sub that was created for the sole purpose of discussing "who is lying, and who isn't." If your argument can't stand without ad hominem, you should reserve your opinion for twitter or tumbler.

              That's an exaggeration. Sure, there is a bit more push-back elsewhere. When this was posted in News the top comment was at least critical of the move, and it has almost a hundred upvotes when I saw it.

               Yeah you're right, people are typically more open minded here on voat. Must have had all those memories of pro-vaxx circle jerking that constantly crops up on reddit. Even still, the vaccine-related discussions I've participated in on voat since the Pao fiasco have been...let's just say pretty one-sided.

            While I have no problem with necessary vaccines, I think forcing them on people is a little totalitarian. I can see people being punished ( no public school entry, jobs, etc) for not having certain vaccines. But forcing is just wrong.

            I think there are many people that would fight to the death for the right to control what is directly injected into them. Even in California.

             After the California State Legislature

              passed SB277
             </a>
             , which forces all children attending school or daycare to be vaccinated, it was clear that this state was on the road to medical tyranny.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, it’s hard to say where that road ends. Like all freedom killing mandates, they never draw a clear line. Each one begets another until all freedoms are lost.
            </p>
            <p>
             That seems to be the case with SB277, which has spawned SB792. If kids can’t attend school without vaccines, why should adults be exempt?

            "SB792- The first US adult vaccine mandate with NO personal exemptions (only medical exemptions approved by a doctor and defined by the bill) and CRIMINAL penalties for failure to comply will be heard in the California Assembly Human Services Committee this Tuesday July 14th at 1:30 in Room 437.
           </p>
           <p>
            "SB 792 would eliminate an adult’s right to exempt themselves from one, some, or all vaccines, a risk-laden medical procedure. This bill would make California the first state to require mandated vaccinations for all childcare workers, including all private and public school early childhood education programs (Headstart, Private preK and preschools), family daycares, and daycare centers.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Commencing September 1, 2016, a person shall not be employed at a family day care home if he or she has not been immunized against influenza, pertussis, and measles. An employee shall receive an influenza vaccination between August 1 and December 1 of each year.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This bill eliminates medical autonomy, crushes religious freedom, undermines personal freedom, and burdens quality providers with a non-optional series of medical interventions in the form of mandated vaccines that are not even 100% effective."
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             You can see what this is leading to right? Like I said before, each tyrannical mandate begets another. Every bill sets a new precedent. In this case, SB792 is the first bill that would force adults to take a vaccine.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are already hospitals around the country that have tried to force their workers to take flu shots, but this is the first time (that I know of) where a state government has used the force of law to make grown adults take a vaccine. But for now, it’s limited to people who work with children.
            </p>
            <p>
             But does anyone really believe that it will end there?
            </p>
            <p>
             Laws like these are forging a burden of responsibility that is collectively shared by everyone. The fact that it’s possible for one person to spread a disease to anyone else, means that everyone is responsible for everyone’s health, or so their logic goes. But why apply this thinking to kids, or adults that work with kids, when it’s equally applicable to every form of human interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately, it’s only a matter of time before they start to apply that thinking for everyone. Schools and daycare centers aren’t the only places where adults interact with children. I cross paths with minors every time I go to the store or go for a walk. Should I be forced receive a flu shot every year, just because I have the gall to step out of my house?
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s the precedent that SB277 has set, and SB792 will reinforce. It won’t be long before they try to force vaccines on every adult and child in California. And if they pull it off there, legislators in other states will try to see if they can use the sheepish tyranny of majority rule to force vaccines on their citizens as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             The slippery slope never looked so slick.

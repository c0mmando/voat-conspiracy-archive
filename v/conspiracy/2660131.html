<p>From the article: </p>
<p><em>Parkland, Fla., shooting survivor turned anti-gun activist David Hogg avoided another potentially deadly incident Tuesday — after</em> <strong>police armed with assault rifles burst through the door of his family home.</strong> <em>Broward County sheriff’s officials were responding to a call that Hogg and his family had been taken hostage by an assailant armed with an AR-15.</em></p>
<p><em>That call turned out to be false.</em></p>
<p><em>Hogg, thankfully, was out of town when police arrived at his doorstep en masse — prepared for a shootout with an armed menace.</em></p>
<p><em>The teenager was gracious enough to write the incident off as “just a silly prank” — language that was echoed by local police and a number of prominent media outlets.</em></p>
<p>Now, for the correction at the bottom of the article: </p>
<p><em>CORRECTION: 6/14 4:15 p.m. — A previous version of this piece stated that police officers responding to a false emergency call at David Hogg’s home kicked down the front door.</em> <strong>They had a key.</strong> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-enter-the-fray-swatting-david-hogg-wasn-t-a-prank-1528224230-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-enter-the-fray-swatting-david-hogg-wasn-t-a-prank-1528224230-htmlstory.html</a></p>

            Everything having to do with this little Zionist Gun Grabbing Operative is theatre.  Written and broadcast with the intention of changing society so that they can change laws making it easier to turn us all into Palestinians.

             I agree. It's all theater. Curious as to why they made this correction to the article. What's the point? Were they worried that local researchers would wonder why the door wasn't knocked down or replaced, so they had to come up with a different narrative?

            The police have a key to everyone's home basically. It's called a bump key.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you haven't modified your locks to prevent bumping, you should. You merely have to remove the correct pins and use a hacksaw blade and a drill to shape them into security pins. It will provide you with more protection and some lock smiths won't even be able to open it without drilling the lock.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not every lock is made for you to easily access the pins, however.

             This would have been a dumb way to enter a house. You have to insert the key and hit it with a hammer and it isn't guaranteed to work the first time or maybe even the second or third, getting you shot....

             OK, I can appreciate that, but that still doesn't explain why the police would use this method to enter a home they believe has a man inside with a dangerous weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm reminded of all of the suicidal people who are inside homes threatening to shoot themselves and the police always remain outside attempting to talk them down and SWAT is in position waiting to break the door down, er, I mean, use a key to enter.

             I fully support the murder of David Hogg, it's a shame he didn't catch a bullet the first time.

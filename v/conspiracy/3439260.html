           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to Lt Richard Smiouskas FDNY in an interview November 27, 2001, "after the strike on the North Tower an engineer got me onto the roof of WTC 2 the South Tower, I saw people in the windows they weren't jumping they were being forced out."
            </p>
            <p>
             The NYPD refused to attempt helicopter rescues for those trapped in the burning towers, while the official death toll of some under three thousand has been tailored to fit the four hundred Jewish names on the 911 Memorial.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who were the ones who stayed and threw others from windows according to Smiouskas testimony, who were sold out when NYPD choppers never showed up .. Video Link, Where Did The Towers Go - 3 of 3 [redacted], the FDNY says "about 1500" jumpers were identified scroll to 2 min 15 seconds in the video.

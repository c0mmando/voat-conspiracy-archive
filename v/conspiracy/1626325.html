            I'm part jewish. But not all jewish so I don't get in the club officially. I'm a bit salty about that, not that I want to be part of taking over the world but because I feel like I'm missing out a bit on what all humans have when they are part of something. I don't like how jews are racist about who they let be a jew. What if a catholic person had a non catholic grandma. Would they not be allowed to live in Rome? Maybe a bad example. But the point is they're way to inclusive based on race and ancestors and it's too similar to what the Nazis were doing in thinking they needed a pure Aryan race.

            because many are lazy-minded people with short attentions spans that prefer to think in terms of meme's, just as those that put all blacks in the same basket, or all Muslims, etc.

            the problem is not "the Jews" - the problem is that there is an incredibly shady, corrupt, devious
            <em>
             element of Jewry
            </em>
            that is tremendously over represented in every major public institution including finance, education, entertainment, news media, publishing, government and law and this influence has a tremendous impact on your life, whether you realize it or not
           </p>
           <p>
            and frankly i'm not sure that many of these Jews -- the Ashkenazi Jews, which apparently make up the vast majority of those living in Zionist Israel -- are even Jews since there have been several books written and DNA tests conducted that would lead one to believe they are descendants of the Khazarians - a bunch or war-mongering people who
            <em>
             converted
            </em>
            to Judaism
           </p>
           <p>
            that aside, what you've heard -- "Jews control everything" -- isn't far off the mark if we define "Jews" as mostly those who are Zionists, which the Ashkenazi largely are
           </p>
           <p>
            if you study a little history about Hitler and Germany's role in WW2 (beyond the garbage we were spoon-fed in government schools), you will probably gain a much better understanding of what drives western culture and politics, particularly U.S. and U.K. foreign policy

            a few quotes...

            “To determine the true rulers of any society, all you must do is ask yourself this question: Who is it that I am not permitted to criticize?” — All America Must Know the Terror That is Upon Us by Kevin Alfred Strom, August 14, 1993
           </p>
           <p>
            “Politics in America has become a Jewish profession, just like arts and the law,” […] “We now are overrepresented in all these areas.” — Ira Forman, executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council, in the Forward article Dozens of Jewish Super-Delegates May Hold Key to Democratic Race by Jennifer Siegel, Mar. 20, 2008
           </p>
           <p>
            “What I oppose most is the international Jewish money power that is met in every war. That is what I oppose–a power that has no country and that can order the young men of all countries out to death.” — Henry Ford, The People’s Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century by Steven Watts, 2006, p 383
           </p>
           <p>
            “The wealthy Jews control the world, in their hands lies the fate of governments and nations. They set governments one against the other. When the wealthy Jews play, the nations and the rulers dance. One way or the other, they get rich.” — Theodore Herzl, founder of Zionism, in Deutsche Zeitung
           </p>
           <p>
            “I’ve never seen a President — I don’t care who he is — stand up to them. It just boggles the mind. They always get what they want. The Israelis know what is going on all the time. I got to the point where I wasn’t writing anything down. If the American people understood what a grip these people have got on our government, they would rise up in arms. Our citizens certainly don’t have any idea what goes on.” — Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral in the US Navy and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, from an interview with Mordecai Gur, 1973
           </p>
           <p>
            “Israel controls the United States Senate.” — Sen. William Fulbright, while a guest on the CBS television program Face The Nation, Apr. 15, 1973
           </p>
           <p>
            “Congress, the White House, Hollywood and Wall Street are owned by Zionists. They put their money where their mouth is.” — Helen Thomas, former UPI Senior White House correspondent, Dec., 2010
           </p>
           <p>
            “There’s a major lobby in the United States. They are hard workers. They stay on top of every comment, the most powerful lobby in Washington. Israel has f—ed up United States foreign policy for years.” — Oliver Stone, American film director, screenwriter and producer, during an interview with The Times newspaper, Jul. 25, 2010
           </p>
           <p>
            “But I believe that Israel has a powerful stranglehold on the American government. They control both members of the House, the House and the Senate. They have us involved in wars in which we have little or no interest. Our children are coming back in body bags. Our nation is bankrupt over these wars. And if you open your mouth, you get targeted. And if they don’t beat you at the poll, they’ll put you in prison. […] They’re controlling much of our foreign policy. They’re influencing much of our domestic policy. Wolfowitz as undersecretary of defense manipulated President Bush number two back into Iraq. They’ve pushed definitely, definitely to try to get Bush before he left to move into Iran. We’re conducting the expansionist policy of Israel and everybody’s afraid to say it. They control much of the media, they control much of the commerce of the country, and they control powerfully both bodies of the Congress. They own the Congress.” — James Traficant, former U.S. congressman, during an interview by Fox News, Sep. 10, 2009
           </p>
           <p>
            “I have never been so upset by a poll in my life. Only 22% of Americans now believe “the movie and television industries are pretty much run by Jews,” down from nearly 50% in 1964. The Anti-Defamation League, which released the poll results last month, sees in these numbers a victory against stereotyping. Actually, it just shows how dumb America has gotten. Jews totally run Hollywood.” — Joel Stein in Who runs Hollywood? C’mon, the Los Angeles Times, Dec. 19, 2008
           </p>
           <p>
            “Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel. Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. That is why gentiles were created.” — Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, head of Shas Council of Torah Sages during a sermon delivered Oct. 2010 in Jerusalem
           </p>
           <p>
            “Of one thing we can be reasonably certain: any society that attracts large numbers of Jews can expect within a few years to enter a spiral of decadence. Moral anarchy sets in. Sexual promiscuity throws open its Pandora’s box of evils. We saw it in Weimar Germany. We see it gathering pace in America today.” — Dr. Lasha Darkmoon in Sex and the Jews: Letter to a Jewish Correspondent by Dr. Lasha Darkmoon, 2010
           </p>
           <p>
            “We Jews, we, the destroyers, will remain the destroyers for ever. Nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands. We will for ever destroy because we need a world of our own, a God-world, which it is not in your nature to build.” — Maurice Samuels in You Gentiles by Maurice Samuels, 1942, p. 155
           </p>
           <p>
            “America and Americans are fully aware of the enormous power that is bestowed in the hands of just a few Jewish oligarchs within ubiquitous industries of media, finance, politics, and culture.” — Gilad Atzmon in Trump Whistles His Dogs, by Gilad Atzmon, Nov. 1, 2016

            I loathe him. And his daughter. But I also think that people should shore up their conspiracy skills. I sometimes wonder if much "anti-zionism" is not ADL sorts false-flagging. That happens all the time in France.

            The answer depends on who you're asking. You could start with "who's a jew?" I can tell you that being Sfardi with strong Yemeni or Tunisian ties counts for shit. Oh, the anti-semites may still loathe you, but the banking elites don't recognize you. Or the Falashas. Nope. "Jew" is a European game, reserved for the near-whitest of Red Sea Pedestrians.

            So, you're limiting yourself to Ashkenazi "controlling everything". Well, "everything" is ill-defined. You're also facing an existential question of what a conspiracy is. If 1,000 people have been conditioned to flee at the sound of an alarm, is it a conspiracy? Well, it is to the 1,000 people who have been conditioned to draw weapons at the sound of the same alarm. In fact, they may get the sense that the fleers are responsible for the alarm.
           </p>
           <p>
            The conditioning and "conspiracy" of "jews" really only extends to the formation of modern Europe. I'd say the conditioning is that "jews" have accepted a permanent minority status and always support other minorities to establish a defensive block. Collectively, there is a conditioning to try to establish an alternate marginalized population. The majority will never screw the jews, if they're busy sticking it to the blacks, or the Irish, or the illegal Mexican. This is not a conscious conspiracy as much as a defensive attitude with reprehensible results. It's not endemic to "jews", either: Israelis don't really do this shit. Where are their open borders? Nah, Israelis tend a bit thuggish and clannish -- much like their Eastern European forebears, but here they represent a majority and can take their own side with impunity. (I'd add that most Ashkenazi have a bit of racial anxiety because they suspect that they're ethnically and culturally more European than Semitic. Thus, the weird archaicizing behaviours of some sects. And the loathing most jews have for Israelis.)
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if you're a perpetual minority, you hope to succeed not with the "rising tide that lifts all boats" (remember -- you're boat will get lifted second to last), but with a strategy of technical superiority. This is where the big money and big bets ride: support staff to mainstream society of any culture -- bankers, not industrialists; judges, not politicians; etc. This strategy entails one set of conspiracies. This is where you get the big reveals of which major power player was a jew, and always in a secluded position, safe from public scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's another stream of extreme popularism, though. This has not paid of historically, but the 20th century flipped the script. Imagine you're have a low caste. You could be a whore. One step above that is dancing girl or singer. For most of European history, actors and entertainers have not paid off. It was a social dead end. You can name Shakespeare -- but can you name a single actor at the Globe? A lot of jews ran entertainments -- circuses, cabarets, magicians, dramatists -- and no one cared because it was a lot befitting their station.
           </p>
           <p>
            When DW Griffith used his power to end the sale of film stock to would be jewish film makers, he created a monster. They founded Hollywood. Hollywood has been playing the same role for the US that Riefenstahl did for Hitler. It's the same game, and a lot of conspiracies begin and end there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd add that jews are also absolutely miserable about lying about themselves as representative of all jews. I had to listen to some blowhard from New York wheedle on about how she was practically the first jew in Oregon. She moved there in the 90s. This promotes a sense of homogeneity. Oh, there were jews in Oregon since the 1880s, but she never met them. The "Jew from New York" has run roughshod over southern history with this one. Jewish defenders of the South? You bet your ass. Have they been silenced today? Well... did you hear about them before this post?
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Voat, I'd say that most users have intuited the stupidity of the post-WWII sacrosanct status of jews. (The same goes for blacks.) Because criticism is not permitted in some circles (most secondary education, when curtailing debate reaps nasty returns), there's a frisson for finally getting to blame the jew. To this type, the big bad jew has exempt from criticism for too long. Ironically, it serves to feed the conditioning never to criticize the jew. Most of the posts read more like Tourette's than a logical argument... they tend to be overly dramatic and presume too much cryptic assistance. It's not there -- for every jew, there's an equal and opposite jew. For every Sarah Silverman, there's an Milton Friedman, etc. Now, there are some opaque conspiracies that could be advanced about how that might frame debates, but ... I don't think that's what you're wondering about.

              Why? I am suspicious of your questioning, based on your interchange elsewhere in this thread. The question seems a bit disingenuous, honestly.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd be wary of anyone who feels contempt for someone who is resentful that someone outwitted them. That's idiocy cloaking itself in virtue. I'll tell you a hilarious tale from WWII: Jews stupidly tried to bribe Krauts to overlook them. The Krauts would keep the money and report the bribe. Most Ashkenazi act like greedy Germans or dishonest Russians -- just like their "host" populations. I don't like Germans and I'm not
              <em>
               really
              </em>
              fond of Russians.
             </p>
             <p>
              I always wonder this about the would-be third reichers around here: why would I ever side with Germany, which seems to waver between cultural suicide and losing poorly at genocide? They don't have the capacity to suffer (like Russia) and they blame everyone else for their problems. If it's not the muslim, it's the jew, or the slav, or the papist. Suppose you are "white" but slavic -- would this rhetoric ever inspire you to white pride?
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess there's your answer: most ashkenazi lived in Germany or Russia. These may be the two worst populations on earth with a possible exception of the pedophile British (and Dutch).

            I've got a question for you. On other topics posters generally wait, read comments and posts, or go outside of voat and research something like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Answers about memes or internet culture can be answered in the comments of another post.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this question...
           </p>
           <p>
            Every week there is a post like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hey guys, love voat. But what's with the jew hate??"
           </p>
           <p>
            "I'm on board with voat, but I don't get what's with all the stuff about Jews?"
           </p>
           <p>
            You know the answer to this question already. Even a brief glance at comments on reddit, YouTube, voat, or any social media will give you enough information to figure it out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not to mention the thread from last week, or the week before, or the week before...
           </p>
           <p>
            You learned in school about hitler and his claims about the Jews. In fact the oppression of the chosen is a fairly common topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            But here you are asking again.
           </p>
           <p>
            So op, why?

            My main gripe with Jews is simple: they are basically a cult that
            <em>
             only
            </em>
            looks out for their own. That in itself is understandable, as we all tend to veer towards our own. What is the
            <strong>
             real
            </strong>
            problem is that they don't admit it, and do it very sneakily and shady. Everything is an "angle" that leads to what they want. I've seen this from the banks, to Hollywood - all the way to Jewish friends I have IRL. It's the conniving, lying and shadiness that is the problem. The fact that they
            <strong>
             never
            </strong>
            get shit for how inclusive they are with EVERYTHING should tell you how much they control. They keep the circle (pun intended) tight, and outsiders out. Just my opinion.

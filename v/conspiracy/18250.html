            We should not be worried about whoaverse as a whole. We should be worried about our little section of it. And if our little section happens to be the biggest content maker on this site, then so be it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As long as we can get our shit together and have good content in
            <em>
             this
            </em>
            subverse, then nothing else should be considered at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, our subverse should lead by example and if other people migrate to this site and notice that we are happy, then that will encourage them to also create and foster their little corner of this site.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is really that simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if, worse case scenario, we are the only subverse that ever becomes popular and that ends up dominating this whole site, then that is also not a bad thing. Whoaverse sounds like a great name for a conspiracy site anyways.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it like this, if I open a cook-shop to sell greasy food to drunk people, and I happen to make an amazing sandwich with chicken and cabbage. And words spreads and the majority of people come for that sandwich, ignoring the rest of the menu completely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then guess what, with continued success, I would get rid of the neglected menu items and focus on that sandwich. I may even change the name of the shop to reflect and emphasize it "Sean's Famous Chicken".
           </p>
           <p>
            You go with what works. You don't start making shitty chicken sandwiches in order to push the other menu items to the forefront.

            Ok so lets say some asshat was able to reg my UN before I was able to reg it. It's my name, it's my ident, why should someone else be able to make me look however they wanted to make me look and damage it?

             But what if it wasn't "some jackoff" who made an account with the same username? What if somebody completely unrelated to Reddit or
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             made the account? Would you still insist that Atko relinquish his account because he had the misfortune to pick your username in particular?
            </p>
            <p>
             How about the opposite; what if someone that doesn't go on Reddit (god forbid there are other sites on the internet) claimed the username Zenof on another site before you made up the name. Then by your reasoning, Atko should give your account to them because you're impersonating them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your username isn't your identity, it isn't tied to any social security number or social insurance number. I cannot go to the bank and issue a loan under your username, nor can I file a tax return with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your username is just an alias, regardless of how powerful you think the internet is.

              The account in question was Flytape's, it was registered roughly 20 minutes after the reddit shitfest started.

             <p>
              It definately was registered by a member of conspiritard and they registered

             <p>
              So instead of getting a car loan with the name flytape, what was done was inflammatory. That's why action was taken, not only to right wrongs but to try to rid ourselves of that scourge

               That doesn't change the fact that it's an alias though. If I had the username SnoopLion, it would be ridiculous to assume that my real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. or that anything I say represents his stance regarding anything.

                 Don't get me wrong, I understand why Atko did the name swap. My issue is with the whole "I have the right to my previous username" deal; I think it poses a decent chance of pissing people off if the community grows.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think the assumption that Atko might be a bit of a pushover is a legitimate concern however. His stance regarding censorship and administrative power is indeed noble, I just think that at some point he has to put his foot down regarding what he wants to do with this site.

                  Yeah, I'm way too tired to go into all of that. I'm not sure where  Akto came from but his acknowledgement of how we aren't crazy leads me to believe he's a solid dude. Or is it cause we almost mass migrated here and he doesn't want to loose the flowing? hmm o.0

            I was a casualty of the " we must treat all pain with oxys" in the 90s. I had fractures in my spinal processes in my neck. First visit I walked out with a script for 120 40mg oxycontoin and 90 10mg oxycodone. 10years like clock work same thing every month. Then one appointment just cut off. DEA was up the Docs ass so he just cut everyone off. Started buyin pills, then sniffin heroin. I understand I made some poor choices but still feel like I was set up like a bowling pin to become an addict. Been clean almost 4years but went through alot of shit to get here. I think all drugs should be legal which may seem strange, but I believe I could've found something that would have helped besides hardcore narcotics if I could have made my own choices about what medication was best for me. Drug laws just make Cartels rich, fuel the prison industrial complex, and are a continual erosion of our rights and freedoms. Btw, make no mistake Pharma is a Cartel.

            Most retarded shit ever, my parents generation could walk into a pharmacy and buy Tylenol w/ Codeine without a prescription... My grandparents and great grandparents could buy way more, by the time I get back to my great grandparents or their parent's generation, nothing was "off limits" or had to have a prescription....
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm say is we used to have a free country, we used to have rights over our body and our ailments and determining the proper treatment. We don't anymore....
           </p>
           <p>
            Realizing some people think that actually having freedom and autonomy over what we consume is "problematic" or wtfe, I feel they're full of shit and too much blood has been spilled to gain and maintain such freedoms, just so fucking cry baby pansies can lament junkies and idiots, and beg Big Brother for more intrusive authoritarian garbage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drug abusers, low-lifes, all these types of people were always here, and will always be here. Unfortunately so will shit-fucked conditions and circumstances will be around causing humanity a lot of grief and agony.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess what I'm saying id this is a dead story, there are only about 2 solid perspectives on it the; "Little Billy OD'd on Oxy's and Xanax and died
            <strong>
             AND IT'S YOUR FAULT!!!
            </strong>
            ".... &amp; the; "Hey motherfucker I busted my ass and broke my back building the infrastructure that holds multiple communities together and now I should be subject to; random urinalysises, "pill counts", and all kinds of other shit because little Billy is fucking retarded....?".
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess I'm on the latter side of the argument. Sick and tired of being dictated to by shit fucking drug pushing doctors, and fundamentally retarded jack-offs who want to be little dictators... Half of those idiots all "1488", and big on bashing "degeneracy", with no appreciation for how many drugs kept Hitler going because he too broke down his body serving his country.... But those ignorant "Neo Nazi" wanna-be faggots, left &amp; right, want to imply people like me are "degenerate" for needing a fucking pill? Or should be dictated to by conformist cuck pussies who've never done an honest day of work in their lives.......
           </p>
           <p>
            So really, Purdue knew of OxyContin abuse way back when.... And the makers of Sudafed knew people were making meth out of it eons ago too.... And the makers of cough-syrup knew that shit was being abused..... And the makers of "Motion Sickness" pills knew dumb-ass teenagers were overdosing on the Diphenhydramine they put in that shit and hallucinating back in the 90's too......
           </p>
           <p>
            It's the nature of the beast, it's a similar "conspiracy" across the board, but at this point particularly with the pills, it's went far beyond "correcting" a problem and well into fucking over the disabled/permanently injured....

             Well said. I think another difference in the generations are the marketing tactics and profiteering off of the ignorant patients. These companies new they were sitting on a cash cow and all they had to do was claim since your doctor prescribes this it's ok. 10 years later and there are 10s of millions abusing them. Now they know there is a problem and regulate the shit out of it which inturn has created what has to be the largest drug fueled crisis in mankind. Like many other things a few got rich while the majority got fucked.

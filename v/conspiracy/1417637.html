            So aliens care about our gold, came and traded for it, but then gave it back to us because we have laser jet printers? They sound quite nice.

            When you keep making up fake paper gold to hide the fact that there is
            <strong>
             no

            gold in the vault, it's hard to not make up

             too much paper gold

            .

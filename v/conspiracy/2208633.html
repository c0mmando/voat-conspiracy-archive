<blockquote>
<p>The original picture, for which Shields was paid $450, was taken by fashion photographer Garry Gross in 1975 for a Playboy publication titled Sugar and Spice. It was one of a dozen images of Shields designed, according to Gross, to reveal the not-so-latent sexuality of the prepubescent child.</p>

<p>Those photos can be found uncensored with a quick google search. They are regarded as (((legal))) despite being blatant CP. Brooke Shields was later casted in Pretty Baby where she played the role of a child prostitute. She had nude scenes in the movie despite being 11 at the time. She was chosen for the role after the director saw her nude photos.</p>

<p>Now her photographer mother Irina has been ordered to pay 10,000 euros in damages to Eva for taking the explicit pictures of her in the 1970s, when she was between four and 12. She made her movie debut at the age of eleven in 1976, playing a child in Roman Polanski\'s movie The Tenant. In 1977 her mother lost custody of her children and Eva was brought up by the parents of footwear designer Christian Louboutin.</p>

<p>The Left was pushing child sexual liberation as part of the Sexual Revolution, pedophilia was common among the Left. That\'s why Hollywood excused Roman Polanski raping a 13 yr old girl, etc etc etc.</p>

              There's really no need for name calling. I'm a reasonable person. I see Lockheed Martin and Northrup on the list there, so I fail to see how those aren't pro-war contributions, but I suppose if you could convince me otherwise without insulting my intelligence, I would be open to listening.

               Probably because their employees tend to be ex-military.  And military people were for Ron Paul because he wanted to bring the troops home.  Maybe their family members have their sons and daughters in the military .

               It's not because Ron Paul votes for war.  That's ridiculous.  Go read his voting records and his speeches to congress.  A good place to start would be this book:

             While I agree that we should look at where contributions come from, I also think we should look into why they come from certain places.  We see in your link that in 2012 Ron Paul's biggest contributors were individuals who were/are apart of the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force, US Dept of Defense.

             This is interesting that those in the armed forces wanted to support the candidate that called for bringing troops home.  Who is notably quoted as saying:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "We just marched in so we can just march out."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr/>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "War is never economically beneficial except for those in position to profit from war expenditures."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <hr/>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "Terror is a tactic. We can not wage "war" against a tactic."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             and with his reputation as a non-interventionist, it leaves us with a few main possibilities as to why they may have contributed.
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Possible reason one:
              </strong>
              They agreed with his current voting record of voting against wars/intervention/aid to other countries and focus on having our budget to be allocated towards defense spending instead of on wars(they went to fight in those places, saw how bad the wars were and want our involvement to end).
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Possible reason two:
              </strong>
              They may have contributed to him because he is a veteran.
             </li>
             <li>
              <strong>
               Possible reason three:
              </strong>
              They are directly or indirectly benefited by contributing and think if they fund him he will change the way he votes as well as his rhetoric much like what we saw with Obama.(yes Obama didn't have that long of a record to begin with, but his positions did change after elections)
              <strong>
               How could this possibly benefit the troops?
              </strong>
              Perhaps some in the armed forces have buddies in arms manufacturing industry they want to garner more sway for...?

              <strong>
               Possible Other reasons:
              </strong>
              There are many other reasons they may have contributed that I'm not informed enough to think of or that are too random or improbable of scenarios for me to list.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             I optimistically believe it was most likely the first reason, though I'm sure many people probably disagree.

            I'm not surprised.  Citizens don't like the patriot act, so politician won't vote to renew it, but they will just come up with another similar bill. That way they get the benefit of saying they voted to against the patriot act, but still get all the perks of having a domestic surveillance bill.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Among the most elaborate schemes was to "create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba. The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday or any grouping of persons with a common interest to support chartering a non-scheduled flight."
            </p>
            <p>
             Lemnitzer and the Joint Chiefs worked out a complex deception:
            </p>
            <p>
             An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CJA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone [a remotely controlled unmanned aircraft]. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Elgin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a "May Day" message stating he is under attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the U.S. what has happened to the aircraft instead of the U.S. trying to "sell" the incident.

            The fucking thing is.. this was decades ago.  False Flag attacks are our special forte, sadly.  Amazing that they could fly planes remotely back in those days.. and people find it hard to believe that anything remotely like this plan has even been conceived, let alone enacted upon it's citizenry [see; 9/11].
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, and in case you wondered what happened to JFK after he rejected this (and a dozen other proposals)... wonder who he pissed off:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Following presentation of the Northwoods plan, Kennedy removed Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, although he became Supreme Allied Commander of NATO in January 1963. American armed forces leaders began to perceive Kennedy as going soft on Cuba, and the President became increasingly unpopular with the
             <strong>
              military
             </strong>
             , a rift that came to a head during Kennedy's disagreements with the service chiefs over the Cuban Missile Crisis.

<p>On February 4th, 2017, Wikileaks posted a very strange Tweet, and they have continued to release one (with the hashtag #Vault7) daily since then (through today, Feb. 8th, 2017).</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://postimg.org/gallery/1i1ykmdvc/">here</a> is a gallery containing all of the images.</p>
<p>Now on to each individual post:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65aebfe9f.jpg"><strong>Where is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 6th, 2017. A picture of the Merkers salt mine. Merkers-Kieselbach is a former municipality in the Wartburgkreis district of Thuringia, Germany. The Merkers area of the municipality is famous for its salt mine, which is now exploited as the Merkers Adventure Mines visitor attraction. Here large amounts of Nazi gold, and many stolen works of art were discovered by the United States Army in 1945. General Dwight D. Eisenhower himself went into the mine in April 1945 in order to examine the find.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/b65af1b823.jpg"><strong>Who is #Vault7? -</strong></a> Posted Feb. 7th, 2017. A picture of Chelsea/Bradley Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden. Three extremely famous whistle-blowers.</p>
<p>Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning, December 17, 1987) is a United States Army soldier who was convicted by court-martial in July 2013, of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses, after disclosing to WikiLeaks nearly three-quarters of a million classified, or unclassified but sensitive, military and diplomatic documents. Manning was sentenced in August 2013 to 35 years\' imprisonment, with the possibility of parole in the eighth year, and to be dishonorably discharged from the Army. On January 17, 2017, President Obama commuted all but four months of Manning\'s remaining sentence; she is scheduled to be released on May 17, 2017.</p>
<p>Julian Paul Assange (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer, publisher and journalist. He is editor-in-chief of the organisation WikiLeaks, which he founded in 2006. He has won numerous accolades for journalism, including the Sam Adams Award and Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006 but came to global prominence in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks, provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. In November 2010, a request was made for Assange\'s extradition to Sweden, where he had been questioned months earlier over allegations of sexual assault and rape. Assange continued to deny the allegations, and expressed concern that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States due to his perceived role in publishing secret American documents. Assange surrendered himself to UK police on 7 December 2010 and was held for ten days in solitary confinement before being released on bail. Assange sought and was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012. Assange has since remained in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, and is unable to leave without being arrested for breaching his bail conditions. In 2016, WikiLeaks published the DNC leaks and the Podesta emails during the United States presidential election, 2016.</p>
<p>Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the United States government, who copied and leaked classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without prior authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments. In 2013, Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, after previous employment with Dell and the CIA.[4] On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times. On June 21, 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property. On June 23, he flew to Moscow, Russia, where he remained for over one month. Russian authorities granted him asylum for one year, which was later extended to three years. As of 2016, he was still living in an undisclosed location in Russia while seeking asylum elsewhere.</p>

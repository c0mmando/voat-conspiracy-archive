<p>For a year or so, I came to Voat, but then I felt like it had gotten overtaken. What I mean is Reddit seemed like the &quot;left extremists&quot; and Voat seemed like the &quot;right extremists.&quot;</p>
<p>I decided to take a break from Voat and go back to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Over the years, I have had some popular submissions there. Then, it happened. I was linked to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>. That was like a year ago. Now, I\'m not saying Reddit was ever not compromised, but the last year has been insane. Death and doxxing threats are just some of the crap I deal with daily. Since then, I have been attacked like crazy on that sub, especially by shills that follow me around. There is even a private subreddit called <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/polkadotgirl">/r/polkadotgirl</a> - wonder what they do there? ; )</p>
<p>One may ask why I have not just deleted my name and established a new one, but I did not think about that before making a new sub. Now, looking back, I would have used a different user name, but it has nearly 3,000 subscribers, and I do not want to give up just yet! (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a> - feel free to join if you are still on Reddit!)</p>
<p>In that time, I have been exposed to just how corrupt Reddit really is. My perspective as a mod on a conspiracy sub...well, let\'s just say I am shocked.</p>
<p>I can say for certain that most if not all subs are compromised, even the ones you would not expect. Now, do not get me wrong, there may still be some good some subs and some good mods, but...lord.</p>
<p>I think it is a mixture of things:</p>
<p>1) There are absolutely mods that are directly hired to take over subs
2) There are mods that are easily corruptible (a little power gets to their heads) - I am starting to see how a little power gets to people, and I can see how people can become evil with power (on a larger scale). If just a little modding power gets to people, think about exponential powers that some leaders hold!
3) People\'s inability to recognize their own biases and reflect on how that may affect how they control different subreddits. This is something I am learning a lot. Even if people are not paid shills, they are so wrapped in their paradigms that they really are not different from real shills - they are just working for free!</p>
<p>I have done everything I can to be a transparent mod, and now I see, it is NOT that hard to be transparent as a mod!! Who would have thought that being clear and transparent to a community really is not that hard?! The conspiracy is that modding and transparency is easy. So is modding and corruption (At least on Reddit).</p>
<p>The point of this post is that I feel we are now in a very different era. It is going to be harder and harder to find communities to explore the truth. I think one thing they are for sure doing is attempting to correlate conspiracy theorists with bigotry/hate speech. Topmindsofreddit tries to label me as a Neo-Nazi, but I can tell that this is just the beginning. I mean, I know this is already happening, but I can see it getting way worse in the next few years. </p>
<p>I am here to make sure I continue to explore all avenues of speech as I feel they have all been mostly compromised. Though I have not been on Voat for a while, I am going come back and participate here more. I am, of course, still growing my sub, but I want to make sure I do not dismiss places where good things are happening!</p>
<p>The saddest part of my journey is that I have realized that many people really are so corrupt. I know all may not be spiritual or religious here, but if this is not the end times, I do not know what it is (or it is hard to imagine how it could be worse than this!)</p>
<p>It is almost as if I feel like I cannot trust anyone, and that is sad. Something has been lost.</p>
<p>Still, the harder we shine the light of truth, the harder the darker forces will push back!</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for reading, and I hope this was at least some what insightful. I would love to hear your thoughts!!</p>',

            There has been a 'conspiracy forum' known as Above Top Secret (ATS) for years, and it is compromised from top to bottom.  It was probably built by the CIA from the ground-up!

            this has been heart warming i have a theoretical view that there are two 'uncorrupted' forums presently on the 'internets' :
           </p>
           <p>
            one of course is 'V/contact' the other may be 'PClinux'
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't fully know how this happened? 
any of it.
i'm just hitting keys.
           </p>
           <p>
            the other predominant theory is that they {the aforementioned} are the two most corrupt {while appearing not} and all other forums on the INTERNET have been tainted by their dark insidious friendly {generally amicable and helpful} tendrils.
           </p>
           <p>
            in the end you can't fully know because you are here with us 'in the game' so to speak, but you seem to be making some inroads here so i being ever amicable and helpful would say - "don't give up" {i'd sing that} and "keep learning things."

              i've gone onto the 'crowd-funded' theory,  it's an old classic but i really like it.

            Online gangstalking, sounds scarry. Can you link me to some or your posts? Excuze my laziness, i am on a phone.

            Reddit's modfaggotry is not unknown on voat, probably the biggest reason most of us migrated. I have a theory that most, if not all, subreddits are controlled by a handful of people who are paid to keep the "peace". Wouldnt be suprised if Shareblue had a department for reddit shilling and censoring.

              I admire you, i used to be a big reddit fag, browsed for about 4-5 years daily but when the elections started, the culture changed. Everything was political. Didnt even notice the mass censoring until PG got booted and i started following
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undeleted">
               r/undeleted
              </a>
              and similiar subreddits and after countless t_d threads where they call out powermods, i saw the truth. After that, i only posted on
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               r/conspiracy
              </a>
              but the amount of negative shilling (namecalling and stalking on other threads) i got sick of it. Constant negativity like that isnt healthy for a person. I cant go back anymore, it is a whole different dimension for me, i envy their ignorance but i am still glad i know whats going on.

               Yes, I cannot say I really enjoy the environment anymore. The only thing that keeps me around is that I have my own sub and have some control over the shills.

                  Very much possible. I am not a big fan of cryptic posting, actually i dont like it at all. I think Q is our disinfo agent, half truths mixed with half threats. He himself said that "disinfo is necessary". Idk why so mcuh cryptic stuff though, why doesnt he predict something simple and innocent to convince us he is ourfag?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Didnt he also say he wont post anymore? Now i see him quoted in PG posts, what the fuck...

            They say I am a neo-nazi. A libertarian... Wrap your head around that one. What you are seeing is Marxism in action. If you are not versed in what this is I recommend you learn about the Frankfurt School in a hurry.

              Back in the CT days, a couple of my accts made their CSS list. They would harass in other subs to try and drive you off the site completely. This has been organized and going on a long time.

              I have always maintained that the way we as a society function is by cracking racial jokes. If we can't joke anymore we have serious problems.

               What is hilarious though is my subreddit is SO tame. It is not a racist sub in any way! So, if they are trying to curb my sub, I can only imagine it will get worse.

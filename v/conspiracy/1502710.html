            (brother nathanael)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd certainly prefer the scenario where Trump is our guy and saves the day for a greater good. I voted for him to oust Hillary and the satanists.  But isn't he just the other side of the coin?  A Luciferian Zionist?
           </p>
           <p>
            To accept that he's totally independent one would have to discount lots of things in his past to truly believe that.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are the company you keep. Early career, he got up and started with ties to Roy Cohn (Jewish mafia), money laundering fronts in Atlantic City (CIA links). He essentially was in the same circle of people as the Clintons (at his wedding). He was friends with Jeffery Eppstein, and might have had staff members at Mar-A-Lago (several hundred yards away from Eppstein's place) groomed and recruited by Epsteing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Testimony of the 14 yo girl who accused Trump of raping her while at Eppsteing's compound has corroborating witnesses....but suddenly was dismissed days before election due to trivial reasons. Girl did not list her address, as she was fearing for her life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does Trump show 666 (A OK) hand signs all the time when he speaks? Why does he make illuminati pyramids with his hands in photo shoots? Why Masonic handshakes with Sean Hannity?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is his NYC condo essentially a shrine to Apollo (the Sun God)? Why is the inverted illuminati triangle architectually built into the trees in the facade of the NYC trump tower? Why is the exact same red marble used in his lobby that the ancient Egyptians transported and used in their temples (travertine. one of the pharaohs transported like 7 tons of the stuff for one of their temples)? Why is the Chicago trump tower shaped like the Egyptian heiroglyph for ISIS?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Jared Kushner (Ivanka's husband) buy a property on 5th avenue and have the address CHANGED to 666. Why did Ivanka marry an Orthodox Jew and convert to the religion (Orthodox Judaism practices the preachings of the Talmud (bad stuff) and is said to be Luceferian. Why did Trump's father donate large sums of money to Talmudic/Orthodox jewish temples back in Israel?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Trump appoint COO of Goldman Sachs and essentially a substantially Zionist staff to his cabinet? Why is Trump meeting frequently with Henry Kissinger (argued by many to be a key player in the Illuminati leadership), who has been out of office for ages?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is Trump alluding to 911 conspiracy and unearthing it, but only pointing to the Saudi connections? He has totally disregarded the connections that point back to Mossad, and is essentially putting disinformation out there regarding cheering Arabs in Jersey.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know what reality is any more than you do. But, there sure is a whole hell of a lot of stuff that points to Trump not being who people believe him to be!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll be happy if we aren't in direct conflict with Iran by the time 8 years roll by....and Hillary/Obama/Bush/Cheney/Bill/Bush senior/the entire shadow government are all executed for treason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, don't forget the Jesuit upbringing and education Trump had.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything short of that....makes me suspicious.  I'm certainly open to alternative timelines/interpretations...so have at it and tell me where I'm wrong!

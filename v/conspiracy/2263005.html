            They would need many data point because society is a spectrum of ways of thinking and perceiving the world.  A decent sample size of random people would approximately guarantee info leakage and dissemination.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the periodic production of symbolic boogeymen and the reaction the public has to them is the primary utility explanation.

             So you think they performed experiments on people without an expectation that they would get any results?

             I find that.....difficult.

            Did you even bother to read the man's
            <a href="http://editions-hache.com/essais/pdf/kaczynski2.pdf">
             manifesto
            </a>
            before presuming why he did the things he did?  Because he told you exactly why at great length.
           </p>
           <p>
            I strongly recommend everyone read it, he is by no means 100% correct but he was an articulate and brilliant man.

             Another option is that Chris Cornell had told his wife over the telephone he was going to commit suicide, that she rang the bodyguard who knocked on his door where after in the absence of a reply he indeed had to smash his way in.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

              </a>
              .. the first shows Cornell had made himself comfortable on the hotel room bed, the next has the noose on the bathroom floor and blood.
             </p>
             <p>
              The last which must have been posed, shows where the carabena on the rubber cord that supported his weight damaged the door.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Postulate the head trauma took place when the noose was released and the singer's body crashed to the floor, that the rib injuries occurred when the bodyguard applied CPR.
            </p>

            <strong>
             Edit:
            </strong>
            So how did the bathroom door come to be locked from the inside, while the cord and carabena were
            <a href="http://i.imgs.fyi/img/100l.jpg">
             jammed
            </a>
            between the top of the door and the door frame ??

<p><strong>The Patriarchy</strong></p>
<p>In 412 AD, Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria died unexpectedly, this left his nephew in training Cyril as the likely successor. However, there was another named Timothy who was favored by Christian sect known as the Novationist. There was a bloody and violent battle over who would assume power in Alexandria. It was Cyril that won and he quickly confiscated and closed all the churches that belonged to the Novationists and banished them from the city.</p>
<p>Two years later, now Patriarch Cyril of Alexandria also confiscated all the property of the Jews in Alexandria and then banished them from the city. Pope Celestine I also took similar action in Rome, banishing the Novationist, who supported Patricharch Nestorius\' heretical ideas of the nature of Christ. </p>
<p>In 431 AD, Cyril laid out the ground work for a rebuttal against the ideas put forward by Nestorius. In doing so Cyril was able to convince Celestine I as well as 250 other bishops attending the Council of Ephesus that Nestorius was committing heresy in argument for a division in being of Christ. Nestorious\' deposition and excommunication set in motion events that would lead to splitting of the Catholic Church and see the birth of Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>
<p><strong>The Split</strong></p>
<p>In the year 451 AD at the Council of Chalcedon some in attendance rejected the Arian notion that Christ was a created being rather than part of the Holy Trinity. This group viewed Christ as one with God, which aligned with their ideas that Christ was of a mixed human and Divine nature (miaphysite) and not of separated Divine and human nature (Nestorianism). The bishops who viewed Nestorianism as heretical refused to accept Pope Leo\'s Tome and thus forged the first schism in the church. This was the beginnings of Eastern Orthodoxy. It was at this council that Jeruselem was given to Bishop Juvenal, which had, at this point, been a Roman city for nearly 300 years.</p>
<p><strong>Jeresalem</strong></p>
<p>The Jews have always viewed Jerusalem as their land, promised by Yahweh. In 70 AD the Romans saw to it that this region belong to them. In a 7 month siege the Romans killed over 15,000 jews. Eventually they sacked the city and left it destroyed. Hadrian returned in mid second century to claim it for Rome. This series of events upset the jew and it was at this point they began plotting their revenge. It wasn\'t until the above mentioned Council did the Bishops realize that things were taking place behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Through a series of planted conversions using the Novationist movement and another sect known as Quartodecimanism, the Jews were able to sew discord among the clergy of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p><strong>The Fall</strong></p>
<p>(((They))) attempted to supplant Christianity shortly after the last great emperor of Rome, Emperor Theodosius I, died in 395. His sons age 18 and 10 each took half of the empire, Arcadius (18) in the east and Honorius (10) in the west. Neither ruler was particularly strong, but Honorius was so young and easily influenced he fell for the (((tricks))). Pope Innocent I tried to exert his influence over Honorius and manipulate him into writing a letter to his brother, Aracdius, to denounce the author of Adversus Judaeos. That author being John Chrysostom, a man who was vociferously anti-jewish. Honorius died with no heir and left Western Rome in shambles. Arcadius, however, had a son Theodosius II who ruled the east after the death of his father in 408 AD. </p>
<p>Theodosius II\'s rule presided over much of the schism in the church and he even tried to restore order to the west by appointing a cousin of his, Valentinian III.</p>
<p>Fast forward to present day I have recently found a <a href="https://archive.is/XHJcw#selection-107.0-107.14">post</a>, from 2010, vilifying a tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church. I could only think of one group of people that 1. Hold grudges for millennia, 2. Sells and markets many rings, 3. Hates Eastern Orthodoxy. It\'s the jews of course.</p>',

            Where is there any continuity in the Jews? What Jews are you talking about? Weren't the Judeans virtually wiped out in 70 AD? Hellenic Jews were still around, but most modern Jews share very little DNA with Hellenic Jews.

              DNA obviously has something to do with it, it's why the Jews interbreed so closely.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the second part of the Talmud wasn't written until the 500s. As I've already mentioned, I doubt those Jews have the same DNA as current Jews, since the Jews you are talking about were presumably Hellenic Jews.

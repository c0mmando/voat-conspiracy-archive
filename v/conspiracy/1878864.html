            Jared Kushner--the one White House aide who cannot be fired
           </p>
           <p>
            If we know that Trump has this egotistic need to be perceived as top dog/king, then perhaps it is actually advantageous for his supporters to continue to support such exposure of the power that Kushner is having over the White House.  If an eventual MSM article about this dynamic reaches Trump, perhaps his ego will kick in as it dawns on him that Kushner is trying to be "top dog."
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know if he could ever accept or fathom the concept that TPTB could manifest a complex/ far-reaching plan to have this agent implanted within his actual family, but if his basic ego is offended, he might become more aware of Kushner's (and Ivanka's) subtle maneuvers. However, I'm sure Kushner is adept at making Donald feel inflated and that he is indeed "the man."   ...The realization that he was being targeted from within his own family, that the enemy was so all-encompassing and powerful to have pulled this off, I fear might undo this somewhat simple man, however.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is an illustrative account, of how Trump got offended by media, late-night talk shows, and SNL suggesting that Bannon was the actual power behind the throne:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=71047">
             http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=71047
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Times also reported that “Bannon’s Svengali-style reputation has chafed on a president who sees himself as the West Wing’s only leading man,” and that “several associates said the president had quietly expressed annoyance over the credit Mr. Bannon had received for setting the agenda—and Mr. Trump was not pleased by the ‘President Bannon’ puppet-master theme promoted by magazines, late-night talk shows and Twitter.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "A Republican source close to Trump told The Daily Beast confirmed this level of insecurity over Bannon’s reputation coming from the president, and mentioned that the president was “irked” after catching a glimpse of a recent cold-open on Saturday Night Live.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Bannon was depicted as a Grim Reaper character who manipulates Alec Baldwin’s President Trump into sowing global chaos and diplomatic breakdown. At the end of the scene, “Bannon” tells Trump to give him his Oval Office desk back. Baldwin’s Trump calls the Reaper “Mr. President,” and then proceeds to go sit at his own much smaller, shorter desk, where the president plays with a kid’s toy instead of governing
           </p>
           <p>
            "'Did you see this crap?' Trump asked the confidante, referring to the SNL sketch."

            (From a WSJ article...)
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Journal notes that Kushner’s Cadre stake “means the senior White House official is currently a business partner of Goldman Sachs Group and billionaires including George Soros and Peter Thiel.” The Journal also reports that Kushner didn’t disclose a number of loans “totaling at least $1 billion, from more than 20 lenders,” on properties and companies he co-owns; and Kushner “has also provided personal guarantees on more than $300 million of the debt.” An analysis of the debt on these assets “found ties to a broad swath of U.S. and foreign banks, private-equity firms, real-estate companies and government-owned lenders.”

            The Prodigal Son-in-Law: Jared Kushner And The Rise Of The Neo-Cons In The Trump Admin
           </p>
           <p>
            April 15, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=71370">
             http://stateofthenation2012.com/?p=71370
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Despite Trump’s campaign promises to not get involved in Syria or in regime change, it seems Kushner really is the “neo-cons’ back door” into the Trump administration."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Interestingly, in the days and weeks preceding the U.S. attack on Syria, there are plenty of indications that Kushner was involved in positioning the Trump administration for a drastic change in Middle Eastern policy. Most notable among these was Kushner’s trip to Iraq in early April where he had been invited by Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, Jr. “to meet with Iraqi leaders, senior U.S. advisors, and visit with U.S. forces in the field to receive an update on the status of the counter-ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria.” At the time, many pointed out that Kushner had traveled to Iraq before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leading some to label Kushner a 'shadow diplomat.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, of interest was the ouster of controversial Trump strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council (NSC), taking place only days before the administration’s dramatic reversal on Syria. Incidentally, Bannon’s fall from grace – which has only accelerated in the week since his removal from the NSC – was due to his in-fighting with Kushner, proving that Kushner’s influence in his father-in-law’s administration is much more powerful than previously thought."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Kushner’s influence on Trump’s Syria reversal is telling, especially given that Israel stands to gain much more from Assad’s ouster than the U.S. By Trump’s own admission, U.S. involvement in Syria would only lead to more debt for the U.S. and yet another string of foreign policy blunders. Israel, however, stands to gain access to the massive oil reserves under the Golan Heights, the area of Syria that Israel has occupied since the 1980s."

            Zionist Neocons Completely Take Over Trump Administration
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "A very stealthy and slow-motion coup has been executed in Washington, D.C. The coup plotters staked out the West Wing long before Donald Trump ever set foot in the Oval Office.
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is still ongoing coup has been a fairly quiet affair because it took place within Trump’s own family first.  The prime mover of this overthrow is arch-Zionist Neocon Jared Kushner.  His wife — Ivanka Trump – is also playing a crucial role, specifically as her father’s “most trusted advisor”.  As always, there are numerous agents of Deep State who are assisting with the clockwork implementation of every aspect of the takeover."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "Kushner was primed for the advocacy of Jewish Zionism during his college years. His involvement with the college-based Chabad was a particularly important part of his resumé-building.  Chabad House is well known to be an outreach arm of Zionist extremism.  It’s common knowledge within intelligence circles that Chabad Houses worldwide provide safe haven to Israeli agents (especially the notorious Sayanim) during times of urgent need."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "In the ‘advisor’ of Jared Kushner, everything points to an individual who was strategically positioned within the Trump family to achieve the eventual and total control of White House.  It appears that he has almost accomplished that lofty goal as of April 13th, 2017. But who is he really working for?  His carefully constructed political network tells the story."
           </p>

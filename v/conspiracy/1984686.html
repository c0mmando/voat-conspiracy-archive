<h2><strong>IN THE NAME OF TRUTH AND LIGHT</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>AND AS ALWAYS --- FOR THE GREATEST GOOD OF ALL</strong></h2>
<p><strong>MARK THESE WORDS</strong></p>
<p>My Dear Fellow Starseeds,</p>
<p>While we were sleeping, our satanic elite have been very busy, setting the stage for what is going to be an epic battle. It is going to look like we are losing, but that is the point.</p>
<p>This final act, is not so much for us, as it is for those stubborn Old Fools, like myself, who have kept their head in the sand for far too long and refused to stand up for that which is pure, right and just. This final act, is our wake up call to choose compassion, faith and love over selfishness, fear and evil.</p>
<p>We are playing a game right now, called Ascension. Most of us, except for the luciferian team were born with amnesia. If you haven\'t already, you are soon going to need to wake up and find out what your true purpose is...basically we\'re here to help humanity when the sh*t really hits the fan.</p>
<p>We are in a simulation, but it\'s not cold, hard and mechanical as Elon Musk would have us believe.</p>
<p>This holographic reality that we are in, is created not only through our actions, but through our thoughts, feelings and intent. And yes magic is very real. This magnificent illusion was created by God, not to harm us, but to test us.</p>
<p>We are all here by choice.</p>
<p>In a very real way, Earth is like a Master Class at school.</p>
<p>We  choose to come here to help our brothers and sisters, who have been stuck in this vibration, in this game, for 1000s of years too long. They just keep reliving the same sorts of lives over and over again, much like the movie &quot;Ground Hog Day&quot; turned horrifying. It is very sad. </p>
<p>Shockingly, the luciferians are here to help us WAKE UP. Behind the scenes, we are all working together. Hard to believe, I know. </p>
<p>Note: the luciferian muppets are very dedicated, so please don\'t give them an inch, until we have won. They are playing to lose, so never lose hope.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever we need to stay positive and laugh at those cheeky little devils. And get ready to forgive them, once this battle is over.</p>
<p>It is not so much about what we do --- though all of us, have special gifts, such creativity, healing, teaching, empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>It is more about how we feel. Our vibration. So try to stay as happy and joyful as above so below as you can. </p>
<p>The secret to winning, truly, because we are in a holographic universe where one person really can make a difference is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have Integrity.</li>
<li>Be true to yourself.</li>
<li>Be honest and stand up against injustice.</li>
<li>Be the change you wish to see in the greater reality. (This ripple effect will cause tsunamis.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This will all be over within 2 years, at which point, all of us will wake up in our true reality --- which is pure bliss. A lot like Alice in Wonderland.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ive received a dream like this and in case anyone is interested and you did not receive my earlier message, here is Part 1:</p>
<p>Hi! ü§ì</p>

            So, you don't even know what a Luciferian is.  I guarantee the people you're talking about don't call themselves that, nor do they fit the description.  This is called a manic episode, please either seek help, or sip some tea and light some incense.  You need to relax.

            This is the second time I have encountered the term "Starseed" in the last couple of days.  Both times referencing someone with extraordinary experiences.  Does anyone have a source from where this term originated?

             I literally just watch a hilarious ufo "documentary" on Netflix where this term was used. I'm not sure if it's the origin of the term, but it's a possibility that OP saw it there. 
The movie was Extraordinary: The Stan Romanek Story.
            </p>
            <p>
             Its actually a hilarious movie, and I'd recommend giving it a watch just for laughs.

            Thank for sharing.  I too feel like we are trapped in perpetual decline.  Eventually if we decline far enough there comes a line that is crossed.  Im ready, awake and hopefully for the best outcome for humanity.  I am doubtful that it is going to be easy for any of us. 2 years too long.  Wish this shit would hurry the hell up.  As one of gods top cards, may he provide me with strength and guidance necessary to get through this with my family and loved ones together.

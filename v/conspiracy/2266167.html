<p>-<strong>#1</strong> - The Broadcastify archived audio, as sourced by NPR:</p>

<p>It is VERY important that it is this specific version, as it is the only source audio without any editing, unintentional, or otherwise. The official copy on YT duplicates sections at the cusp of each capture, repeating sections and destroying any linear timing.  This is a crucial fact for anyone researching the <em>ACTUAL</em> timeline for themselves.  However, the audio in the link above is segmented, but a complete conjoined version of the segments can be downloaded here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OisB4kggdPI&amp;t=">FF Street Footage with Police Scanner</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The reason both pieces are needed, is because the Friendly Flipper audio continues where the Broadcastify audio leaves off.  Giving us one continuous piece of audio to listen to with no gap or down time.</p>
<p>--The Friendly Flipper audio begins with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[341DC male voice] &quot;Control, 341DC. Im going to be in charge of all strike teams at Mandaly Bay.......&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--For the sake of reference, this can be heard @ 1:09:47 in the NPR Broadcastify audio, demonstrating the two sources have overlap, and thus creating the one continuous timeline. </p>
<p>--It is also relevant to know that I have established, based on others\' painstaking research, that the Friendly Flipper video starts @ 11:11:29 PDT (local Las Vegas time)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING IS <strong>NOT</strong> A COMPLETE TRANSCRIPT, AND ONLY CONTAINS DATA POINTS DEEMED RELEVANT TO THREAD TITLE</strong></p>
<p>1:26:45 NPR Broadcastify [control female voice] &quot;please be advised, now we\'re getting shots fired at Ceasar\'s and The Bellagio.&quot;</p>
<p>1:29:46 NPR Broadcastify [control female voice] &quot;Bellagio is saying NEGATIVE shots fired, at Bellagio, NEGATIVE shots fired Bellagio...&quot;</p>
<p>1:29:54 NPR Broadcastify [control female voice] &quot;...and no one is going in or out, and they\'re locking it down&quot;</p>
<p>30:02 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;Please be advised, there\'s a male walking into the Bellagio...&quot;</p>
<p>30:14 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;Please be advised, at the Bellagio employee entrance, there\'s a male walking in with a rifle, Bellagio employee entrance&quot;</p>
<p>30:47 FF Street Footage audio [unidentified male voice] &quot;we\'re gonna be, uhh above the Bellagio here, just confirming, the valet?, or where was the entrance they went in?&quot;</p>
<p>30:53 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;it\'s gonna be the employee entrance&quot;</p>
<p>31:17 FF Street Footage audio [unidentified male voice] &quot;...about the Bellagio, just confirm, thats the rear part of the uhh, uh, casino here off of uh, Dean Marti-, Frank Sinatra?&quot;</p>
<p>31:31 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;i\'m not sure where the employee entrance is.&quot;</p>
<p>32:21 FF Street Footage audio [P91 male voice] &quot;control Petey91 the Bellagio employee entrance looks code 4&quot;</p>
<p><strong>47:09 FF Street Footage audio [Sergeant Jessie Wiggins 744] &quot;Sergeant Jessie Wiggins 74-&quot;</strong> </p>
<p><strong>47:12 FF Street Footage audio [unknown source] (((automatic shots fired can be heard)))</strong></p>
<p><strong>47:17 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;getting a 415A now, Bellagio, the PER(?) is hearing a lot of shots being fired&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>47:26 FF Street Footage audio [unknown source] (((more automatic shots fired can be heard over an open mic)))</strong></p>
<p><strong>47:52 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;please be advised, the 415A at Bellagio, PER(?) is hearing a lot of shots being fired, not seeing anyone.  Theyre on the first floor, and she\'s whispering.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>48:09 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;and now she\'s saying suspects are inside with her, and she\'s whispering, can not talk&quot;</strong></p>
<p>48:15 FF Street Footage audio [unidentified male voice] &quot;time lapse on that report please?&quot;</p>
<p>48:16 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;that came in at 23:55, 4 ago...&quot; </p>
<p>48:21 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;...and we\'re calling Bellagio now&quot;</p>
<p>48:52 FF Street Footage audio [control female voice] &quot;units reference the Bellagio, its going to be NEGATIVE 415A, and thats per security.&quot;</p>
<p>53:14 FF Street Footage audio [unidentified male voice] &quot;strike team at Bellagio ??? strike team in Bellagio, that we need ???&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>So, the question is:</p>
<p><em>Did the gun shots come through Sergeant Jessie Wiggin\'s communication?</em></p>
<p>or </p>
<p><em>Did the gun fire cut off Jessie\'s transmission, coming from another unknown, unidentified source?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Maybe we should be asking the sergeant directly:
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessie-wiggins-33bbb84a">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessie-wiggins-33bbb84a</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So, with all of the relevant police scanner traffic demonstrating: </p>
<p>--reports of shots being fired at Bellagio.</p>
<p>--report of male walking into Bellagio employee entrance with a rifle.</p>
<p>--control speaking with a female whispering inside Bellagio reporting &quot;suspects are inside with her&quot;</p>
<p>--Sergeant Jessie Wiggins or someone capturing automatic firing over a open mic, well over an hour after the shots at Mandalay Bay ceased.</p>
<p>--3 seconds later ANOTHER report of shots fired at Bellagio</p>
<p>This begins to paint a larger picture with many data point correlating at the Bellagio, which also corroborates Rene Downs\' eye witness testimony of yet ANOTHER independent report of shots fired inside the Bellagio <strong><em>AROUND THE SAME TIME</em></strong>:</p>

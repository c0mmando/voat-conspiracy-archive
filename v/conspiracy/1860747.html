            He or they seems to have a lot of corroborating evidence that backs up whistleblowers and researchers alike, from Dr. Steven Greer to Dr. Michael Sala, William Thompkins, David Wilcok, Max Spier, Corey Goode, the list goes on and no on.
           </p>
           <p>
            As with all of them, assuming they are telling the truth is one of their messages so that people willing can open their minds.

            You will notice the cabal also runs on symbology, from movies to TV shows, to event backdrops, so they can release some of their bad karma by looking back and saying, "see we were telling them what we were doing". Apparently this won't absolve their wrong doings by a long shot, but they will need all the help they can get when cornered by good forces.

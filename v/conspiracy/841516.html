<p>Well this shouldn\'t surprise anyone really but in the papers the horror stories about paedophilia and child molestation matched the same \'type\' as porn stories and erotic fiction. Well this troubled him and he decided to investigate further, he created sets of all the stuff about sexulized children or sex crimes involving children which he then studied for internal sets - basically he was trying to see what themes there are in the way the media talk about this sort of thing - six weeks later after an exhaustive study he incinerated his papers, wiped his computer, threw away most his DVDs [holywood blockbusters] and stopped watching television.</p>
<p>why? well he confided to me it\'s because it came close to sucking him in, because he said he could almost see how reading this stuff was building a machine inside his head which works like a language translator but which takes normal things and coats them with a thick layer of filth, he said when he started to learn how perverse the mindsets of those that are afflicted with this machine are, he started to hear the voice of the machine, started to see the things it was showing him...
and this is an entirely normal seeming, sane chap with a Phd in a serious science telling me that - i met him a few years after his discovery, he\'d detached from the populist media\'s archetype and was a bit of a beatnik, one of the many that flowed out the top of the system and came to settle with the drifters and wonderers...</p>
<p>everyone has a story if you listen for it, everyone knows something the rest of the world hasn\'t seen.
So we chatted a lot, this was when i was studying the secrets of the occult and especially demonology, i told him this is talked of in the dark arts manuals as a scourge. That using clever words [the \'spell\'] and mysterious motions [often symbolized with a wand or hand-passes today] it\'s possible to summon a demon into someone\'s mine, a demon with the power of possession and torment...</p>
<p>this is a thing that most secret sects have discovered, kept secret and holy - of course the group we\'re calling the cia would know of these sorts of things. however my friend didn\'t portion these events to the CIA, my friend believed the demon itself was responsible, in our talks he came to feel comfortable calling his machine a demonic force, said the analogy better suited the creature.</p>
<p>He told me there was a certain construction of thoughts that would start the machine turning, the demon growing - a slow fascination would develop in which first one found themselves following avidly news which disgusted them, the justification that one just wants to understand it, wants to stand against it.</p>
<p>The slow progression of knowledge soon reaches a point where one knows too much, stories are no longer shocking they simply fit into an established understanding - now it\'s not simply a case of adding data but of expanding and testing the established patten - now the demon is looking for certain kinds of sustenance. Mt friends study of linguistics gave him a rare extra option to investigate from a detached and scientific way, he confided he doubted he could have escaped without such forearming.</p>
<p>Each new story was interesting only if it extended the frame, if it added some new gory detail or idea - soon it was seeking out new extremes, was imagining what might come after, was inventing whole new possibilities. He became aware of the real power of it when he found himself describing luridly the potential future developments which might be possible, he became convinced he was being compelled to guide the media further into depravity. This is what convinced him to end the work and destroy his writings, he became convinced he was becoming the problem.</p>
<p>In understanding the processes which might compel someone to act in such a vile way and the reasons and thrills they might get from doing it a person locks into the wavelength of that perception - suddenly that is an option, suddenly that is one of the many things we \'should\' explore - if they can build the machine inside your head they\'ll use it to compel you to create machines in others heads, this is how self-propagating machines work, it\'s like a cancer of perception.</p>
<p>We chatted for a long time about such things and i put his mind at rest by showing him that as too there are indeed demons of massive power and mighty wrath who torment and abuse the week so too there are angelic powers of much greater magnitude and more forceful furver that shield us and protect us and fight for us and with us and beside us eternal.
Just as constructs of evil exist on certain planes so too do constructs of awesome glory, magnificent joy - with rightfulness as your sword and self-decency as your steed there\'s nothing which can\'t be faced and overcome.</p>
<p>The secret is to learn how to tilt your head, not literally but figuratively change perception of things - look at a thought and realize it\'s not your thought it\'s a product of the machine, it\'s simply one possible plane of existence and there are many others - simply look at things from a different angle and find one which is angelic. Personally i don\'t think it\'s an accident the word angel and angle are so similar, they mean almost the same thing when you really get down to it.
find the planes you want to exist on and let the others pass through you, pay them no attention and give them no power...</p>',

            Sounds to me like your friend rediscovered ideas, which today are more popularly called "memes".

            Yeah, because people are really keen to re-read something or hear it again.  That's why Voat filters duplicate posts.

            Thanks OP for this post. I work alot on metaphysical things, and I also have noticed the frequent use of certain words in different news stories, and know the dangers of our created language norms, but your theory adds to the logistics which I hadn't figured out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did an astral projection session last summer and saw a thick smoky cloud around earth, which seemed to be maliciously devouring our energies, and I understood it would feed here until it couldn't anymore, and would just float on and destroy another planet. Such giant and dark forces do exist, but you're completely right that the good ones do too!

            this is the demonic ai "machine" at work. and he is right, they do attach to your head and control your thoughts. it doesn't matter what side you are on, Republican, democrat,christian, muslim, black, white, red, blue, pro this, contra that. as long as you are playing their game, it controls you. it all ends at the same deprived disgusting place with all kinds of violence against humanity. it is looking to take over, especially with the ones who are unaware.

            This all ties in with what anon calls "meme magic", which is also incredibly similar to Sigil magic from the Chaos tradition.

            Hey, this is a great little story. It might seem long and involved to some, but I really dug it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's fascinating that your friend discovered this through his linguistic means. I've been coming to a similar perspective myself - partially through observation and maybe a little occult concepts thrown in.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do like to think of these structures as "machines" as well, so that's a neat similarity between theories. Psychic and mental structures are set up in individuals and communities, whole societies, and the structures operate as machines generate thoughts and emotions of certain types.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now whether or not these structures are directed or invented by people, they also have life of their own and will self-perpetuate with the energy given to them. Ultimately, I do think that there is an overarching gestalt of all the negative structures that we might call "evil" or even the force of "the Devil" (not to be religious). I think that the instinct/nature of this "thing" is to propagate discord, destruction, hate, disharmony, etc. That's what it is, and it benefits from the spread of negative stuff like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            And just as you said, there are also harmonious forces as well. I suspect that these forces can be summed up as "Love". But not hallmark, Valentine's Day love. Rather love in the sense of harmony, construction, creation, and order. For example, when a car's engine is running well, all it's parts are working together harmoniously. I'd say that the car's engine is in a state of "love" - just like when a romantic couple have happiness together, they are also expressing "love".
           </p>
           <p>
            The negative constructs are much weaker than the harmonious ones, but unfortunately, they're also much trickier. I do wonder why this world we live in seems to have ended up dominated by the negative forces...or perhaps that's just what the negative forces want us to think?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a bit of a shame your friend destroyed his research. It would have been fascinating to look at, but I can understand why he did.

            I felt something akin to this when I 'quit' being a republican. They really (and I mean both parties) indoctrinate you so thoroughly. I think I voted for every libertarian dog catcher and school board member I could find, but when it came to the positions that mattered, I flinched and voted republican. That was when McCain was running.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Netflix was new and they only had documentaries I watched a lot of them. At one point I could actually feel my mind flip into democrat mode. It was odd.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not voted in 3 years, I will this year - but not with any actual hope that said candidate will make a difference. The machine is set in place and running.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that they are pushing the country right again, and then we will be pushed left after that.

             I think the pendulum swings of its own accord, back and forth, back and forth, and they just help it with the tiniest pushes, not because they
             <em>
              need
             </em>
             it to go that way but because they expected it to go that way, and they've planned 30 years out with that in mind, that it would go that way at that time. Like right now they need a Republican in office to prosecute war and have the Right take the fall... letting ISIS flourish is both immunizing the Left against blame for waging war and forcing people to react by moving Right. When they need to expand the military-industrial complex they swing Right, when they need to expand the welfare and police state they swing Left; either way globalist divide-and-rule wins.

That\'ll trigger automated trading algorithms to suspend trading for the day, and the next market to open will he the London exchange which will also drop before trading is suspended. The NYSE will open next and they will experience another cataclysmic drop before the computers tell everyone to go home. I am willing to bet that that week will see a 5% drop worldwide in total trading volume. </p>
<p>Its just a spark though but its one with international consequences. You look and you\'ll see a ton of other groups seem to be intentionally using that date as a baseline for the kindling they\'re throwing on the same fire. For instance, at that time we are also going to be reminded that food stamps only run until the beginning of March and no deposits will be made for the month of April. Not a spark, but kindling. Those hungry people are going to be mad. </p>
<p>But thats not the only source of kindling. A bunch of school unikns are taking the opportunity to strike. Denver and LA will be shut down. Gotta qualify what I mean by kindling here. Its when margenalized people are put in a position to riot.  Unions have always had opaque leadership. From now to March I expect to see even mlre teachers unions vote to strike. A ton of children will be in school without any supervision.</p>
<p>April will be a shitshow. Like a bursting dam.</p>',

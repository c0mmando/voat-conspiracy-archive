<p>Energy is the single greatest commodity: if you\'re of the opinion that TPTB are running a giant energy factory, then our attention is what generates it.</p>
<p>If you take a more practical approach that TPTB makes us all debt wage slaves, then they do so by keeping our attention captive in the pursuit of their self-made money. In this state, we act like zombies with little time left to pursue self-actualization. We remain unaware of our true strength. Our energy is given away for what\'s karmically pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is the process of focusing our attention inwards and paying ourselves instead. We receive energy--currency--in the form of wisdom. It gives us the ability to create our own roadmap rather than wandering down a generated path in a sleepless state. It is the path to our sovereignty.</p>
<p>Indeed, attention is precious because it\'s our time. Something we can never get back. Think of the phrase itself, &quot;pay attention.&quot; The word pay is used precisely because attention itself is of value.</p>
<p>Now, what have we been paying attention to these days? Personally, my attention has been focused on things that have made me feel a sense of anxiety and hopelessness. Yet these are the emotions prized by those in charge because they can be exploited quite easily. If you\'re into the esoteric, it\'s this negative energy that serves as the fuel for the archons, reptilians, whatever.</p>
<p>While these negative emotions are an unfortunate byproduct of being informed of the man behind the curtain, they are only useful if they act as a springboard to choosing a more positive path and ultimately, future. This negativity is best used to actualize, &quot;this is not how I want the world to be. I want a peaceful, compassionate world.&quot;</p>
<p>The second part of this statement is one of the most important parts, and unless it\'s integrated, we all lose. The energy vampires win. If we remain in the negative, we will always be ceding our control by expecting those at the top to change their behavior for the sole reason we are mad at them. Hint: they eat that anger for breakfast and embolden themselves. They only become scared when that anger gets channeled into creation of ideas that cause their demise.</p>
<p>For example:
1. Get mad about Seth Rich... but use that anger to reform the political system.
2. Get mad about the usurpation of our privacy... but use that anger to switch to platforms that give a shit about it.
3. Get mad about GMOs... and use that anger to buy organic or grow your own food.
4. Get mad about debt slavery... and use that anger to get out of debt and start your own business. And buy local.</p>
<p>The powers that be only run scared when the second part of action follows.</p>
<p>One of my absolute favorite quotes is from Buckminster Fuller:
&quot;You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.&quot;</p>
<p>The good thing about positive energy is its well-studied ripple effect. There doesn\'t need to be many of us to make a sizable impact, and the Maharishi effect point to as much. When you activate your light and act with positivity, it\'s a game changer.</p>
<p>We\'re all just nodes of energy connected to the other. You have the power to grab it from source and use yourself as a conduit to pass it around to others. You are your own printing press. When you tap into source, it can light up the world and elevate humanity outside the reach of those who feed on negative energy. It renders them obsolete on a spiritual and practical level.</p>
<p>And never, ever let anyone convince you that being cheerful, happy, or compassionate are synonyms for gullible, ignorant, weak, or stupid. It is no accident that our society has been conditioned to think that snide cynicism is what\'s needed to feel accepted by our peers.</p>
<p>I can imagine countless books that I\'ve had to read about the Art of War, Saul Ailinsky\'s guides, and 48 Laws of Power. Far fewer books (probably none) were on my curriculum that related to compassion or collective empathy. We are primed to be negative energy machines... and that has to stop.</p>
<p>I love you guys.&quot;</p>',

            The Schumann Resonance has been in a state of powerful union for a while now. It's showing signs of collective consciousness being more unified, more powerful than ever before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I've spent the last year coping with the crumbling away of my dated perception of reality. Alan Watts opened my eyes, my intuition started questioning the nature of things, weed and LSD helped open my mind, and after several months, I concluded that there is no self. Now that the schumann resonance frequency has raised, I can feel these intellectual realizations (about our external world and about our inner world) becoming experientially fundamental to my state of being. My ego is dying away, and I'm being born into a newer, fresher, more beautiful, less demanding, more free, more unified state of being than ever before. Yet, it feels like a process of remembering who I really am. And I believe that, based on the rising of the Schumann frequency, we're at a point in 'the game' where things are really starting to pick up. The world is really changing. Our perception of reality is going to change, fundamentally.
           </p>

            After coming to the realization that, for the most part, we all believe we are our own thoughts, rather than the consciousness in which the thoughts have arisen since day 1, I looked back into the world to try to understand it. Knowing, factually, that there is no self, I couldn't fathom why we have such a negative, struggling, suffering, hateful, cruel world. But it's because we're trying too hard. In truth, love comes when you stop trying to feel it or give it.

            True love comes when you stop trying, completely. TPTB gave us the psychological paradox through which we've based our lives on in America, known as, "The pursuit of happiness." Yet, happiness is only truly experienced when the pursuit of it no longer exists. So, screw them. Let go of the journey, the pursuit. Let go of needing to be anything other than what you are. That's true freedom, and that's where real change lies.

            If we all remember the simple things in life, the really, authentically beautiful things, and stop trying to figure out life, it'll come to us. We all, as a species, need to let go of the ego, let go of desire, of attachment, of demand, of judging anything and anyone, of feeling that our lives need to be other-than-what-they-are. Then, we will begin to live through the heart, rather than through the mind. We will come together in a more unified, compassionate banding of brothers and sisters than this universe has ever seen humanity do ever before. The world is changing, and we're going to be here to see it and do it.

            All we have to do is let go of the ego and remember simple beauty. Laugh at the negativity, because now we understand where it's coming from, and the most powerful thing we can do is love the cruel ones back. They cannot defeat love. As corny as it sounds, love trumps all else.
Awesome post, OP! Thank you. Love, love, love, man. It's always the answer."

            I submitted an article detailing pizzagate titled, "why is public so complacent about torture, rape &amp; murder of children by the WH?" It was suggested I should have submitted it as a discussion, which I agree with and would be just like this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have found it difficult to understand the almost across the board refusal to even acknowledge this issue on social media. Few passionate ppl are beating head against wall while everybody else is unfazed. I really can't imagine what it would be like to have it be reported.

             Have you seen the recent video done by Anonymous? It was a very compelling vid about how the "man behind the curtain" keeps us complacent. It's here

             . I shared it but who knows if anyone will care enough to watch it. I personally have stated several times before I even knew about pizzagate that it felt like the world was spinning so fast and things were happening so rapidly that I couldn't keep up with anything much less decern the flakey unimportant things from the things that really mattered.

              I am sure that's a big part of it, busy, low paying jobs just to survive have shown to make ppl less interested in their communities. And it was a stated, intentional goal of tptb in the Wikileaks emails, along with poor education. "Keep them ignorant and compliant."  The thread I posted did get some responses which brought up the following: 
 bec the MSM blackout/fake news,many just don't believe it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many find hard it to believe at all. Which is understandable.
             </p>
             <p>
              There a ppl who seem to just not care. (Child prostitution recently legalized in CA, posted ppl were apathetic about.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Churches are not teaching about role of satanic forces in end times. Your dad may be able to comment on that.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's all I can remember right now.

              The more we know about it, the more pervasive it seems. Maybe everyone will just be like, "oh yeah, it's bad," yawn. 😵

            Pizzagate is ancient news relative to the news cycle most follow. I followed it closely for a while but it seems nothing is going to be done about it. As sad as it is, unless a miracle happens and pizzagate somehow comes into the spotlight outside of the internet, it may be forgotten about, and those who remember shunned from polite conversation

             Have you checked in to see the new information that has been uncovered? It's kind of frightening how many ties have been made to so many seemingly unrelated events. If enough people care about all those events and they see the bigger picture, those numbers combined coule be enough to perpetuate the interest globally.

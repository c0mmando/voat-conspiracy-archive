            That war is supposed to be massive indeed. This prophecy merely marks the starting point of it. Looking at this prophecy we can safely conclude that the big war is not decades aways but only a few years away

            I haven't read much about this yet, but what I took from Gog and Magog, is that they are two versions of man, i.e. two races. What ones? I don't know. White and black? West and East? But TPTB have spent an awful lot of time crafting dichotomies for us to follow.

             For whatever reason, your link was blocked at my work. LOL
            </p>
            <p>
             But i did find this one:
             <a href="https://plainenglishquran.com/Prophecy.html">
              https://plainenglishquran.com/Prophecy.html
             </a>
             interesting indeed.
            </p>
            <p>
             1- There will be many false prophets in the time leading up to the Anti-Christ. (20). In addition, the years before his appearance are tricky. The honest person will be called a liar and distrusted, and the dishonest person will be believed and entrusted. Ignorant small minded people will speak and be listened to about matters pertaining to the general public. (21)
            </p>
            <p>
             2- The Sea of Galilee will dry up and the date trees in the area of Beit She’an in modern Israel will not produce fruit. (22) Recently, the Sea of Galilee has been under significant pressure from water use and drought, and global warming is expected to decrease rainfall in the region further harming agriculture. (23)
            </p>
            <p>
             3- Rain will stop and plants will die. (25). In the third year prior to the Anti-Christ, a third of the rain will not fall. Then the next year two third will not fall. Then in year the Anti-Christ appears no rain will fall. (26) Like the previous prediction, these predictions appear to be coming to pass now as climate change alters rainfall patterns in the Middle East.
            </p>
            <p>
             4- The people of Iraq, and the people of Syria, and the people of Egypt will suffer from economic sanctions imposed by the Europeans*. Then the time of the Mahdi will come. He will establish a justice, strong Caliphate, and money will be plentiful. (27)
            </p>
            <p>
             5- Prior to the appearance of the Mahdi, an army carrying black flags from the land of Khurasan will appear and lay the foundations for his rule. (28) The land of Khurasan generally refers to the land made up of the North Eastern Iran, Western Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.  There are many narrations that predict the coming of the army with “black flags.” These narrations often have different details in them, and they all suffer from weakness in the chain of narration. It can be argued that collectively they represent evidence of the validity of the general idea, and it can also be argued that the entire issue of the “black flags” is unreliable.
            </p>
            <p>
             6- Four events will happen before the battle of the end time, “Armageddon”, and the appearance of the Anti-Christ: 1-Muslims will conquer the land of Al-Aqsa Mosque, present day Israel. 2- A severe plague will kill people in mass. The plague will be like a disease which causes nasal discharge in sheep before they suffer a quick death. 3- Money will be plentiful, at the time of the Mahdi, and 4- A severe trial that will enter the house of every Muslim. (29) Jerusalem was captured by the Muslims in the year 637, and a second time in the year 1187. About two years after Jerusalem was captured the first time, a major plague hit the region that killed many famous companions.  In the year 1348-1351, or about 161 years after Jerusalem was captured the second time, the Black Death swept through the Middle East killing many people. This prophecy suggests that after Muslims retake Jerusalem for the final time, a major pandemic with flu like symptoms will cause massive death in the world. Less people will ultimately usher in a period of economic prosperity.
            </p>
            <p>
             7- After the severe plague will be years of earthquakes and catastrophes. In another narration, if you see the Caliphate headquartered in the sacred land, present day Israel, then the time for earthquakes and catastrophes is near. (30)
            </p>
            <p>
             8- Three trials will hit the Muslim world before the Anti-Christ: 1- The trial of retreat and war.  2- The trial of false happiness. It will come from a man, a descendant of Prophet Muhammad, but he will not be a good person. Then people will resolve their differences with a weak and unstable leader. 3- Then there will be a catastrophe which will hit every person in the Muslim World. When people start thinking it is over, it will hit them again. At the end, they will be divided into two groups. In one, pure belief and in the other pure hypocrisy. When this happens, look for the Anti-Christ to appear at any minute. (32). Other narrations appear to add more detail to either the first or last trial: It will be dark days. People will not be able to trust those who they are sitting with. A person will wake up a believer and go to bed at the end of the day a disbeliever, and a person would go to sleep a believer and wake up a disbeliever. People will sell out their faith cheaply. In those days, a holding onto your belief will be like holding onto a hot coal. (33)
            </p>
            <p>
             9- There will be battles with the Europeans* in which many of them will be taken prisoner. Many prisoners will convert to Islam and join the Muslim army. Then during the time of the Mahdi, there will be a peace treaty between the Muslims and the Europeans. Then they will send an army under 80 flags, under every flag will be 12,000. (34). They will be near the city of Aleppo in Syria while the Muslim army will come from Madina and establish their base near Damascus. Such a huge number of people will die in the battle of “Armageddon” that a bird trying to fly around the battlefield will drop dead. In the end, the Muslims will be victorious. Then they will move on to capture modern day Istanbul without bloodshed. This suggests that the people of the city will remain Muslim, as they are today, but will be under a government that will be allied with the Europeans. Then a rumor will spread that the Anti-Christ has appeared and the army will fall back to the area of Damascus. Horses will be used for this fall back which suggests that by this time gas for vehicles will be scarce. Then as they are readying for battle, and they line up for prayer, Jesus will return to earth. (35)
            </p>
            <p>
             10- Between the battle of Armageddon and the appearance of the Anti-Christ is seven months. (36)
            </p>
            <p>
             11- It is perhaps in the fighting that leads up to, and includes the battle of Armageddon that the prophetic prophesy will come true predicting a time when there would be one man for every fifty women.(37).
            </p>
            <p>
             12- The development of the area of modern day Israel (this could refer to the time when the Caliphate is headquartered there) means the city of Medina is about to fall apart. The falling apart of Medina means the great battle of Armageddon is about to happen. The battle of Armageddon means the city of modern day Istanbul is about to fall to Muslim rule. When it falls, that means the Anti-Christ is about to appear. (38).
            </p>
            <p>
             13- Muslims will invade and defeat the Europeans*, and then they will fight and defeat the Anti-Christ. (39)
            </p>
            <p>
             14- The city of modern day Istanbul will fall before the city of Rome. (40)
            </p>
            <p>
             15- The Anti-Christ will make his appearance with an army from Khurasan. (41) As stated, the land of Khurasan generally refers to the land made up of the North Eastern Iran, Western Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.

There are many narrations that predict the coming of the army with “black flags.” These narrations often have different details in them, and they all suffer from weakness in the chain of narration. It can be argued that collectively they represent evidence of the validity of the general idea, and it can also be argued that the entire issue of the “black flags” is unreliable.

              I don't understand why this narrative is unreliable when we see it happening with ISIS? Like, to a joking degree they shove their flag in our faces.

<p>I quoted it and added in the links below so you don\'t have to go to Reddit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can prove either one of 2 things, that archive.org (&quot;The WaybackMachine&quot;) </p>
<ol>
<li>has a deep state backdoor (and they do / don\'t know it)</li>
<li>is an information gatekeeper for the establishment.</li>
</ol>
<p>I\'ve noticed this several times. You find a \'sensitive article\' that you just know the establishment doesn\'t want you to read (eg: &quot;how to build a proxyham&quot; article another one of our awesome friends here on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> found and posted just yesterday) because of the implications, and it\'s gone. You think, &quot;oh, that\'s fine, just go to waybackmachine&quot; -- archive.org and you get one of three results:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Hmm...we don\'t have that link archived --OR--</li>
<li>Page cannot be crawled due to robots.txt --OR--</li>
<li>Archived links that go to 404 / blank / not found pages</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Seems like this is a legit failure of archive.org to archive those pages. Yet you have bookmarked them for a reason--you have seen content there before. These \'failures\' of prominent pages (it was worthy enough for you to bookmark, and you learned about it from the thousands of upvotes of the link on reddit) are a form of <strong>plausible deniability for absent content</strong> that Archive.org has literally scrubbed from the Internet.</p>
<p>You may think that archive.org is some kind of politically agnostic site that works dutifully like a software machine \'spider\' that goes out and copies the internet. That would be half wrong. So long as information keeps \'disappearing\' then they are hypocrites or they are failing at their mission to keep a copy of the internet. Which is it?</p>
<p>Ok so finally my proof. It\'s actually bad proof in that it requires your help. I need your memory to be evidence. </p>
<p>I wrote this article on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3shst6/hillarys_mspaint_logo_is_by_nycs_pentagram_design/">Hillary Clinton\'s stupid logo being designed by a company PENTAGRAM in NYC</a> one month ago. In it, I included links to Pentagram\'s work and staff. Did any of you take a look? <strong>I know what I saw. I saw many pictures of their logos and a working website only one month ago.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now that website seems to be gone. It loads a white page now for the first two links (&quot;Pentagrams work&quot; and &quot;Pentagrams art genii&quot;)</li>
<li>Ok, so I go to the wayback machine and try those links, and they load white pages, well beyond one month ago.</li>
<li>Well before that and on snapshots going back to mid 2000\'s there are 404s on all those pages I referenced, even though those pages have been archived as far back as 1999 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/our_works">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/our_works</a>) and (<a href="http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio">http://pentagram.com/en/portfolio)</a>) and (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/list">https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.pentagram.com/#/partners/list</a>).</li>
<li>And <a href="https://archive.is/s73mN">here\'s an archive.is backup of the last one</a>...note how there\'s a LOT of activity in december of this year, maybe because of the hillary article I wrote in November of this year??</li>
<li>Notice how several archive.org \'snapshots\' go totally blank: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151206024555/">https://web.archive.org/web/20151206024555/</a> and <a href="http://www.pentagram.com/#/home">http://www.pentagram.com/#/home</a></li>
<li>Notice how Pentagram has been scrubbed from Archive.org almost entirely. You couldn\'t get a list of which designers were there if you tried.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Archive.org touts itself as an independent non-profit but look who they get their funding from: Alexa, an Amazon.com company. Amazon is as establishment as you can get: in fact, at this moment, they are running the CIA\'s software on their amazon elastic compute cloud, an arrangement that makes many people very uncomfortable (the integration of big business with big spying / intelligence). They are also aligned with Library of Congress (gov) and Smithsonian and are members of the American Library association-- this is about as establishment a gatekeeper as you can get.</p>
<p>I believe that Archive.org is an establishment tool to give the appearance of vanguarding information while actually doing no such thing. By selective scrubbing and giving the appearance of software failures or caching 404s, they are able to control the spectrum of \'free information\'. This one example of PENTAGRAM is not the only example by far. I\'ve noticed this trend and at first I thought it was simply a mistake (see plausible deniability above), but in this case, <strong>I got you dead to rights mfkas.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://archive.org/about/">on their about page</a>, they attempt to aggrandize themselves as a modern day, digital Library of Alexandria, which--from an occult symbolic read--is really telling of who is actually running this enterprise at the topmost levels. Library of Alexandria was a gnostic library burned by christians (see film Agora or a documentary on library of alexandria). This is more evidence of global gnostic cabal underpinnings. And I would respond to that by saying this: the original gnostics may have been onto something with universal magic and beauty in nature, something they believed would elevate all of humanity--they hosted the recipe for soma and that\'s why it was destroyed (multiple times actually). If you guys actually believed in original gnostic goals, you would be true to your Alexandrian aspirations and not destroy information--that\'s something Christians uniquely do (edit: well, and ISIS who are probably being paid by christians to destroy zoroastrian and manichean shrines in syria). Making your use of the Alexandrian library trope a complete hypocrisy--you need to clean that up.</p>
<p>If you don\'t understand that last bit it\'s ok. To most of you, the alexandria bit will be a weaksauce argument. I understand why you don\'t understand. As a person with a background in science and software engineering, I used to not have the eyes with which to see these things until I saw the pattern and started taking them seriously as \'things the elite believe whether you do or not\'.</p>
<p>And clearly I struck a nerve with pointing these things out with Pentagram in my Hillary mspaint logo diatribe. Sorry if this appears I\'m patting myself on the back with this, but you would\'t be wrong. &lt;pat pat&gt;</p>

            I've run into quite a few of these scrubbed pages as well.   First that comes to mind which I'm confident some others here will remember is zyrtecwithdrawal.blogspot.com, which until about 2011 had literally thousands if not tens of thousands of people posting horror stories of the  heroin level withdrawal symptoms from trying to stop taking zyrtec every day.  The site was taken down in 2011, and since at least 2013 there hasn't been a non-domain squatting version on archive.org.

            AFAIK, archive.org will remove content on request. I don't believe they have a choice to not oblige if the deletion request is backed by law enforcement or any of the alphabet agencies.
The way I see it, they are busy struggling to maintain their server infrastructure to provide basic functionality. Fighting legal battles against the government under the current legal framework is not remotely in their budget.
           </p>
           <p>
            I currently trust them because I have never seen them falsify/change any info on their archived content.
           </p>
           <p>
            These guys can't do the heavy lifting of going up against the powers that be, so it is the responsibility of us users to help to retain the data. Before going public with a factoid found on archive.org, make a backup of it, so you can later show what was there before the deletion squad moved in. Make screen shots, save the page as HTML, print it as PDF, have a second pair of eyes look at it. Find ways to conserve that info any way you can.

             I agree completely. At the same time, I think we need to enter an age opposite of the SJWs. Because, think about this, if all our information and actions get recorded, there are always people out there wanting dirt on you. Why does it have to be dirt? Why do we have to be ashamed of having made mistakes? Rather, we need to enter an age of true freedom...yeah, we need laws, I'm not talking about anarchy, but people need to chill the fuck out and leave each other alone.

              I agree that if there is indeed dirt that your enemies will try to use on you, all you need to do is admit your mistakes and say that you are a changed person. Everyone goes through their share of shit as if they are trials in your life.

             archive.org does not archive all pages everywhere up to the second. Its spider crawls the web slolwy (much more slowly than, say, Google's) and archives relatively notable pages once every few weeks or months, but obscure pages may never be archived. You can, however, manually archive any page at any time.

             They will also remove pages if they receive a DMCA request. They simply don't have the resources to fight legal challenges, even if they're without merit.

            i absolutely loved reading this whole thing! ive actually been looking for some solid information on symbology being used in modern times. all of this is very informative and you are correct. they are trying to erase the gnostic teachings from this existance.
           </p>
           <p>
            i was also trying ro figure out why siria, what else is in syria that they are trying to get rid of? well aparently syria is where the "womb" of the earth (gia of you prefer). it is located at the centermost point on earth, the belly button, and it has some sort of ultimate healing energies for the human race. i think the kind of healing that can restore the 12 strands and realign the energy frequencies in the body, but also helps realign you to a higher spiritual frequency and connects you back to the spirit of the earth.
also forgot to add that there was "ancient" tech there that would help propel this energy forward and out to reach a larger mass of people, which is currently being destroyed.
           </p>
           <p>
            you and i both know that they cant have that, but it wont stop anything. i mean, look at it this way. yes they tried to destroy everything that would provide us with information in alexandria, but that did not stop the flow of information to the present day.
           </p>
           <p>
            its really crazy how all of this has spiralled completely out of control. i think thats because they are running out of tricks to pull out of their hat. people are becoming more and more aware and they cant control stop it.
           </p>
           <p>
            i saw that you get a lot of info from micheal tsarion, any other good places or people that provide good info on symbolism?

            archive.org obeys robots.txt - there is nothing nefarious about that and they are transparent about it
           </p>
           <p>
            what does that mean? it means that if i archive, for example, my own web page and then someone else takes over my domain because i no longer wanted it, or i failed to renew it, or it was taken over by the gubberment, and the new owner disallows the archive.org crawler in the robots.txt file, then that page will no longer be available
           </p>
           <p>
            archive.is does not obey robots.txt, which is why i prefer it
           </p>
           <p>
            also, archive.org does not get all of it's funding from Alexa - they get it from the public as well, which anyone
            <a href="https://archive.org/about/">
             can easily see
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            on a side note, if you are running Firefox and want a really simple way to archive web pages, see
            <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-url-to-wayback-machine/">
             Save URL to Wayback Machine
            </a>
            - it works with both archive.org and archive.is

<p>Here is what I think. After learning who Hitler was and how dangerous he was, the jews made him meet one of their ashkenazi agents disguised as the perfect Arian woman.

Since jews are well known to use their ashkenazi agents to marry important white people and hypnotize them during sleep to obey, this looks like a rational theory. At least this explains why Hitler went cuckoo and become basically suicidal by declaring war to the most powerful countries world-wide all together.</p>',

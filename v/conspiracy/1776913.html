   [OC] Some Goats in another sub were asking me to post some pics of the CIA Chinese Embassy bombing in Belgrade (1999) so I thought that I would put them here. I hope that that is ok with you all.

The cover story that this was strike against a known Serbian Militia leader. Said leader was staying at a hotel on the same street and that one missile had accidentally been poorly targeted and struck the nearby Chinese Embassy killing a grave shift janitor. That was their story. Oops, we\'re sorry guys but it was an honest mistake, the normal bullshit. </p>
<p>Fast forward to around November of 1999 and me and the Mrs decided to take a trip back to visit her parents in Belgrade and on the first day there she asked me where I would like to go; I immediately replied that I wanted to see the Chinese Embassy, that story stank to high heaven and since I was there I wanted to see it for myself. Now, according to what I had heard on CNN I was expecting something that looked like a hotel (since that was what they had been supposedly targeting) but to my surprise the taxi driver drove us to this giant field with a huge, multi-building compound on it. My first thought was how could you possibly mistake this for a hotel in a row of buildings? Then I started looking at the damage to the structure as I walked around it. Not only was the compound not a single structure in a row of buildings, as heard on CNN, it was free standing with nothing in the vicinity for at least 300m, if you look at the bottom left of this picture you can see where the closest non-embassy buildings are:</p>

<p>The buildings were a total write-off both inside and out and I counted 3 points of impact, not just one. At the time CNN was blasting on full volume what an honest mistake it was to &quot;accidentally&quot; destroy the Chinese Embassy and the new post-Milosevic Government was more than happy to go along with the story. And yes, they posted Police around the site to make sure that nobody took pictures to shed any light on what had actually happened. </p>
<p>This is how they work, they perform an action (in this case it was to punish the Chinese who were screaming loudly about the US breaking International law by bombing Belgrade), they tell a story that will placate Americans and everybody else in the world laughs their asses off. The Serbians knew the whole story was a scam, the Chinese damn well knew the story was bullshit and in the end got a fair amount of money in reparations. They never did get the lives of their 3 Journalists (not a grave shift janitor) back though. </p>
<p>At the end of the day I turned out to be wrong about the number of missiles that hit the compound, CNN (those presstitutes) claimed one, I counted 3 but the Wiki page that I just checked claims 5 JDAM strikes.</p>
<p>When this shit happened it was before the internet so the only information we ever got came from the press and since this all happened so long ago most of you Goats won\'t remember any of this, but this is the clear M.O. of the CIA. </p>

            It's all very messy, I can only say what I saw with my own eyes, and show you with the pictures that I took. You can draw your own conclusions from there.

           <p>
            That being said, I have talked to many of the actors involved over the years that I have lived over here. Many interesting stories.

            Thanks for posting. Bombing Yugoslavia was a crime. Same thing could happen to Macedonia now if they don't do what ((they)) say.

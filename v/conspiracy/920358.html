            Banks and corporations pay good money for the election. It can be expected that they get what they pay for. They paid to have that corporate slut in a position to carry out favors for all of them.

            The best they can hope for is to let Trump have the Presidency and stonewall his policies for 4 years until they can dredge up a more palatable candidate.

             Really?  I don't think making a racist television personality with no experience at all to be our Commander-in-Chief is a good choice for our country.  He's just a loud mouth sociopath that spits out lies and racist comments and for some reason certain people are incapable of seeing through his bullshit.  The alternative is not much better.  It's always been about choosing the worse of 2 evils.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can talk shit about who we support or don't support but that won't matter when you have forces that bypass our democracy.  Keep in mind this is all a big fucking game to the ruling class.  They try to set the people against each other while they continue untouched with their personal agendas.  That's exactly what we are seeing right now.

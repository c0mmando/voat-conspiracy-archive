            This is the way to discover them! Just like catching millionaire tax avoiders through their spoiled brats’ instagrams. I have nothing to offer since I’m not part of the elite but someone I know once mentioned their parents were in the same circle as bush sr., and his wife apparently never stopped drinking through the 50s, and didn’t slow down for pregnancies either. This explains jr’s face having all of the symptoms of FASD simultaneously.

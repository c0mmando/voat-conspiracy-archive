            What a cunt.  Her family isn't even Australian so she shouldn't be here at all let alone have any kind of political power.  Also fuck that slant eye'd slags feels before reals bullshit.  We should discuss ideas instead of drawing lines based on feelings in the sand.  Besides who gets to draw that line? The most offended person in the room? This is exactly why the freedom of speech needs to be absolute.  It's an all or nothing type deal so we absolutely should have the right to be hateful bigots otherwise we're all gonna end up in a fuckin gulag for hate crimes while what remains of society turns into a chink wonderland where everyone is too afraid to have an opinion let alone voice it over the most basic of shit like preferring white bread over wholemeal less they get arrested for a hate crime.

            If that cunt happens to have a staffer read this please tell her I said Wong's in the wong country and she's an uneducated and ugly cunt both inside and out.

            I'm not a big fan of the Jews, but I am a fan of the truth. So far as I know, the assertion that Jews were warned to stay away from the Twin Towers before the 9-11 attack is complete fantasy. Look, guys, we don't need to make up ridiculous lies -- the Jews are doing enough shitty things in real life that need to be spoken about.

             "so far as I know"
If you put all that is known in a bucket, then proceeded to pick out the bit that you know, you'd be holding a grain of sand and insisting you're adept to qualify what is and is not "fantasy" for the rest of us.

             Jews at the WTC who who wished their co workers a fine farewell Monday afternoon September 10, 2001, stayed away from work the next day aware the attacks were to occur and watched their immolation live on television .. that is a good enough reason to hate Jews.

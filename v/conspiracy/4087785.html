            Read The Controversy of Zion by Douglas Reed. He traces roughly 2700 years of revolutions and social upheavals. If he's correct, the involvement of jews seems to have taken a hiatus around the time of the French revolution, to be resumed later. Reed devotes an entire chapter to Weishaupt and the Illuminati, showing how Masonic lodges were infiltrated and later used as a network with the goal of social revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Involvement of jews can be clearly traced after that. A mind blowing revelation from that book is that both communism and zionism were twin movements launched at the same time from the same source. They appear to be contradictory in nature - that is, one seeks to establish a nation-state while the other was about abolishing all nation-states - yet they both had the same end goal, which was world government. Zionism was simply about setting up the capital and ruling power center for that government.

             Did they take a break? Or were the jews involved in the French revolution? I haven't explored this yet so this is just speculation. Hereditary, absolute monarchy has to be the most exclusive form of government. Only the royal family rules and if you're not in it you're out of luck. Replace monarchy with a system that can be infiltrated and subverted - gain power. There's also the opportunity to profit off the revolution - capitalize on low prices and desperation, secure new assets, properties, etc. I'm starting to wonder about monarchy. We are encouraged to believe that monarchy is a primitive form of government and it encourages extreme class divide (dirt-poor peasants). But at least in a monarchy your own kind are ruling you, with the goal of a prosperous kingdom. Theoretically.

             Interesting observation. What will they do when these two movements eventually collide? And what about the Chinese communists? They're genociding the Uyghurs and Tibetans, who are closer-related ethnically and culturally than the jews. Will they be subservient to the jews, or content to rule alongside them? Doubtful.

              I suspect that they actually didn't. IIRC the Protocols also take credit for the French revolution. Being that every other revolution is seemingly connected to their influence, it wouldn't surprise me if they were working alongside Weishaupt or influencing him in some way. I agree that monarchy has gotten a bad rap.

              Good question. I'm not very knowledgeable on this, but have heard that when communism was set up in China, there were a number of jews around Mao who supposedly got him into power. As for today, I suspect that there's worry that China is going to break free or become a power to contend with, which is why we've seen big moves against China the past few years. I doubt China would be subservient. They are very expansionist and a whole other problem on their own.

            I think you have to distinguish between jews and the synagogue of satan people.  Most jews are cannon fodder for the synagogue of satan people.

             Having known many jews, I would agree that many of the average jews are just pawns. Unaware of the larger schema but loyal to liberalism and the (((message))). Then there's the Sabbatean Frankist offshoot of judaism, which is likely responsible for the manipulation we have so far identified.

            A good question. My guess is that "jewishness" has been dissimulated and disquised in so many different ways over the past millennium that it's nearly impossible to say whether certain people are Jews or gentiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some Jews had forced conversions to Christianity in Spain and other places. The king decreed it, so outwardly they were Christian but continued to practice Judaism in secret. Also a lot of Jewish families changed their surnames in order not to be identified as Hebrew. To undermine the Catholic church, Jews had infiltrated it. Then there are people who adopted Jewish practices who are gentiles, and politicians who are controlled by Jews. But according to the Protocols, Freemasonry was established by Jews to control the goy. Freemasonry is a bastard form of Judaism and likewise the Illuminati.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who engage in it are not aware they are under a form of Jewish control.

             You're right. We're not taking into consideration the crypto-jews. Nancy Pelosi is a great example, Donald Trump too. And people have adopted jewish practices without realizing it. I was raised Catholic and many years ago went to a shabbat at someone's house. I was surprised at the similarities between shabbat and mass. Then there's the corruption of Vatican 2, and probably more that I'm not even aware of.

             you mean sir francis bacon walter raleigh etc?
            </p>
            <p>
             the story goes east india company found various things that made their way back to england which then got studied in various places, bacon and raleigh supposedly were the ones that ultimately worked out other occult stuff going on and learned about and harnessed it themselves for the british empire.
            </p>
            <p>
             whether i believe that story or not... eh. entirely possible. the catholics have been hiding stuff since their founding, the bible itself is a mix of oral history and tradition, a handful of rules for life to not be a sister fucking thieving rapist with 50 mongoloid sproglets, and the rest alternates between jewish and catholic propaganda.

            <a href="https://youtu.be/qr_ByQH2QY0">
             Here is a video
            </a>
            of someone talking not only about this week's attack. But also the supposed gas attacks that started the Americans funding the civil war in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this week's attack is being called a false flag because it was a sarin gas attack. The supposed rescuers were only wearing gas masks and no gloves or any type of protection from sarin other than gas masks.
            <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp">
             From the CDC
            </a>
            - "Following release of sarin into the air, people can be exposed through skin contact or eye contact." Also, "A person’s clothing can release sarin after it has come in contact with sarin vapor, which can lead to exposure of other people." Same thing with hospitals that were supposedly treating the victims. No one was wearing protection other than gas masks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there were other things. Certain people were shipped gas masks days before the "attack" (possibly to make good photo props). There were a couple tweets that happened before the attack that point to it being a false flag. After the attacks a doctor at the hospital was tweeting and doing interviews instead of treating patients. And there are questions about whether or not he's actually in Syria or still working as a doctor. (There's a lot of sketchy stuff when it comes to him.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the fact that this small attack would obviously lead to huge problems for the Syrian government. There's no reason why they would do an attack like this to lose so much. Trump said days before the attack that the US would give up on ousting Assad, that he could stay in power and the US would only be going after ISIS. But then for some reason Assad does a sarin attack on a small neighborhood to kill a hundred or so people, which would also guarantee his removal from power. Days after it was decided he could stay in power. So this looks like someone trying to change Trump's mind about Assad staying in power.

                For the false flag:
               </p>
               <p>
                250 people went missing a month before the attack in an Islamic State-controlled hot zone. (1) Around 50 people were apparently affected by the attack. The White Helmet group (2) received full hazmat chem gear a month before the attack. (3) 3 days before the attack, they received gas masks from British groups. The White Helmets, an al-Qaeda-affliated group funded by none other then George Soros are the “first” to respond to the attack.
               </p>
               <p>
                24 hours before the attack, Feras Karam (4), a TV announcer, said, “Tomorrow starts a media campaign to cover the density of air raids on rural Hama and the use of chlorine poison against children.” A Pakistani British doctor, Shajul Islam, the lead doctor in treating these patients, gave interviews with the press rather then helping the victims. (5) Dr. Shajul Islam is facing terrorist charges for kidnapping and torturing two British journalists in Syria and has had his medical license pulled (6). The organization responsible for sending him the equipment to continue practicing medicine in Syria is under investigation for using donation meant for refugees in Europe. (7)
               </p>
               <p>
                OPCW inspected Syria in 2013 and found that Assad had removed all chemical weapons from his stock pile. OPCW also reported that Islamic State (8) and FSA groups had obtained chemical WMDs somehow. (9) Sarin is a highly deadly chemical nerve agent that is easily absorbed via the skin upon contact. (10) None of the White Helmet responders have gloves or protective gear. All have been exposed to skin-to-skin contact with the victims. People are seen a mere 10 feet away without any protective gear. Oh, and of course the previously mentioned 2013 false flag that the United Nations proved had nothing to do with the Syrian government.

                Finally, there’s no conceivable reason why anyone in Assad’s position (being that only days earlier, the US, on multiple fronts, acknowledged a deescalation of position towards Assad’s leadership of Syria) would then go ahead and jeopardize that internationally legitimizing action by hours later committing atrocities that would very obviously bring enormous international backlash. For the US to say, “Okay, Assad, as far as we’re concerned, you’re president of Syria because we want to focus more on defeating real terrorism,” is literally the best thing that Assad could’ve hoped for at any point in the last six years. There’s just no conceivable way they would forfeit that recognition on the world stage.
               </p>
               <p>
                This was a false flag done BECAUSE of the US’ shifted position. Someone got fucking shitter-shattered about the US not doing what they demanded we do. That’s all there is to it.

            Don't know, but I'll chime in with what I can think of at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a
            <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/061669c53ab647708ac6cba656decb2d/timeline-chemical-weapons-use-syria">
             timeline
            </a>
            of the Syrian Civil War from the AP.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the timeline, the civil war started in Mar 2011 with security forces opening fire
on protesters.  I remember reporting that claimed parents were protesting the arrest and torture
of kids in their town.  The kids were said to be mocking something, Assad or something.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assad is said to be of some mystical Shia sect, which aligns him with Iran.  Reporting was 
that the minority Christians didn't have a problem with him, but that the majority of the country being Sunni, did/does.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever Assad's crimes, it sounds like if he's taken out, the head-choppers take over.
           </p>
           <p>
            Increasingly Islamist Turkey is anti Assad and could be a source of false Syria stories.

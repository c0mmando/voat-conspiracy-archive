I have a writing background, and moderate social media following, and I believe they\'re trying to recruit me to write about a number of conspiracies they\'ve discovered concerning a Silicon Valley &quot;cartel&quot; that is essentially controlling the economy, and stock market.</p>
<p>The amount of data they\'ve given me access to is substantial, its probably going to take me a few weeks or more to go through everything. Most of it is news clippings, and circumstantial evidence, but other documents are legit and possibly obtained through freedom of information requests, or hacking. This includes court documents, invoices, company documents, etc. Included in this conspiracy are lists of dozens of whistle blowers who have been either murdered or defamed in relation to these conspiracies which is why I\'m posting this anonymously. I\'ve confirmed many of the people on the lists all died of unusual and suspect circumstances.</p>
<p>The conspiracies themselves range from Silicon Valley using TARP money to inflate the startup market, misappropriating green tech investments from the government towards Tesla and other crony-capitalism deals, considerable Obama White House collusion with Google including putting tech execs in charge of the department of energy, to lobbying millions of dollars to keep the US in Afghanistan to mine for lithium for electronic devices and electronic car batteries. They also touch on election manipulation, fraud, stock market manipulation, brainwashing, propaganda, tax evasion, etc.</p>
<p>The big picture of the conspiracy is Google, Tesla, Facebook, Twitter, and the major VC firms are all colluding together to control the economy, and to control emerging markets such as battery technology, while actively manipulating the public with fake news and propaganda. They were given money from the White House, Federal Reserve, and Department of Energy after the recession to create a new economy for America, but instead kept the money mostly for themselves and their personal agendas.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Apple and Peter Thiel are both absent from this cartel and conspiracy.</p>
<p>They did this by manipulating the public with tech startups and fake news to inflate and over validate tech companies artificially to prop up the US dollar, stock market, and World economy by shaping public perception to give perceived value to the tech industry. They\'re now doing the same thing with electric cars, and trying to hold a monopoly on lithium ion battery technology, and prevent other battery technologies from reaching the market. This cartel was also desperately trying to elect Hillary Clinton so they could remain in power, but failed. These are now all the companies now pushing to defund alt-news websites, and censor the Internet in the name of &quot;fake news&quot; and pi$$agate.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I don\'t really know what to think about all of this. This group who contacted me and gave me these documents claims the FBI is investigating this cartel made up of Silicon Valley billionaires, but that the DOJ and White House are blocking investigations and pressing charges and are waiting for Trump to take power in hopes that they\'ll be able to move forward with their investigations. </p>
<p>They claim more information will continue to leak soon. I wanted to post here to see if anyone else is following these developments and if they have any other information? My only intention currently is to simply to seek the truth, whatever it may be. I\'m posting this on Voat because I tried to post this on Reddit but was censored almost immediately. I\'ve taken precautions to protect myself using Tor and a VPN so hopefully this cannot be traced back to me. I\'m still unsure if I want to write about this any further or not as it could destroy my career and reputation.</p>',

            apple controls the largest 'hedge fund' in the nation.  rewrite and remove your silly bias to try to protect them and you might have some believable rp content.

             I'm just reporting what was in the docs I was sent, there was nothing on Apple. It was mostly focused around Google, Tesla, and VC firms. If anything, this Google "cartel" is a competing entity to Apple. It may even be Apple's dominance that forced this opposition group to form.

            It was ideologically adopted from theosophy and what has coalesced as gnosticism and alchemy, which are intertwined things.  Theosophy was Helena Blavatsky, who was a rich russian aristocrat who was able to travel the world back then and do occult journalism and collect various ideas.  She basically founded modern occultism by marrying esoteric christianity and judaism with chaldean numerology and sacred geometry (ie; freemasonry) with esoteric buddhism, sufism, manicheanism/zoroastrianism, taoism etc into a cohesive eclectic tradition.  Oh and celtic / greek / roman mythology and roman / babylonian paganism as well.  SOrry forgot all that.  It's really, gnositicism is a very big knowledge domain encompassing many things but primarily the idea.  Everything the new agers say is based in some part on theosophy
           </p>
           <p>
            Aliester Crowley is the other.  He took a lot from theosophy but then created this kind of reboot of pagan baal/lilith worship as a modern magic tradition of doing drugs having bisexual sex while applying theosophy.  He called this thelema and 'do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law' was his one rule of that 'tradition.  He was a big influence in the black sun group of the thule society.  He was alleged to be a MI6 spy, one of those occult gladios that implants weird ideas to cause society disruption.  So there's that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vril the coming race by Edward Lytton was a big influence too, it was considered the first sci fi novel.  It's significance is it instilled in German people this idea of classism and racism..this idea that there were people that were better than everyone else in a kind of ultimate way...thus started that whole aryan thing.  If you look at what aryan means it means persian...it's from the indian subcontinent...it's literally where modern pakistan is
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I'd look Blavatsky and her backers.  People try to say she was a Russian Jew.  There's no evidence for that.  I'd also look at Crowley and the British
           </p>
           <p>
            But whenever you say "Jews" keep in mind, that Israel was founded by Great Britain and that a lot of what Mossad does is on behalf of MI6, it's almost like they are an annex or outsource service industry for MI6 so that Great Britain doesn't get blamed for assassinations or stuff
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, I've already said too much. Good luck

             Blavatsky is a russian jewish surname. Aliester Crowley was a faggot satanist. Satanism was created by jews. The whole aryan supremacy thing was a copy pasta of the zionist ideology of the jews being the chosen by god above else. Vril is the copy pasta of Nietzsche ideology of Ubermensch above all and good and evil. Nietzsche was a faggot satanist too. As I said, it was all orchestrated by jews and assholes under jewish control. They usually use all the possible unintelligible bullshit to make people confused.

<p>Hi! </p>
<p>Reddit completely shadowbanned me over 2 very friendly and not at all insane flat earth posts. Odd that they won\'t allow any reasonable debate on Flat Earth. If this is such a ridiculous theory, I can\'t help but wonder, why not let the absurdity of our claims speak for themselves?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SantaStoleMyCookies/">https://www.reddit.com/user/SantaStoleMyCookies/</a></p>
<p>So in case you are interested, here are my 2 posts that Reddit determined were worthy of a ban. I was just trying to have a little bit of fun to be honest and to point out that our conventional Big Bang theory on creation, despite everything that scientists may claim, does indeed take a giant leap of faith on behalf of anyone who has never been to space, whose teachers have never to space and also those critical thinkers who might just be suspicious of a Space Program that was actually founded (and lead) but NAZI war criminals like Werner Von Braun and acclaimed pedo-Satanists like Jim Parsons.</p>
<p>Werner Von Braun --- NAZI Rocket Scientist  --- Head of NASA --- Isn\'t he handsome?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun</a></p>
<p>Satanist Jim Parsons --- NASA Rocket Scientist - Pedo-cannibal-extraordinaire! 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Parsons_(rocket_engineer)</a></p>
<p>Interesting side note: Did you know that the demon satanist Aleister Crowley channelled looks just like a Gray Alien? Neat right?</p>
<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Aleister+Crowley+Gray+Alien+wiki&amp;atb=v39-1aq&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.occultphysics.com%2Fimages%2FCrowley-Lam-grey-alien.gif">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Aleister+Crowley+Gray+Alien+wiki&amp;atb=v39-1aq&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.occultphysics.com%2Fimages%2FCrowley-Lam-grey-alien.gif</a></p>
<p>Also do you remember, by chance, that NASA space crew that we watced literally explode into pieces on live TV during the 80s? This devastated a nation and long story short --- their space shuttle &quot;blew up&quot; --- as rockets and missles so tragically often do. :(</p>
<p>Anyways, great news! Did you know that every single one of these astronauts/actors are still alive and kicking today? Some of them subtlety changed their names, some of them didn\'t even bother. Some even took on the identity of their &quot;identical twin.&quot; And they all look exactly like you\'d expect them to look after 25 years. Curious. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/q4t4fjYkWc8">https://youtu.be/q4t4fjYkWc8</a></p>
<p>Also, have you ever wondered why, maybe, so many archaeologists, military pilots, consumer pilots, naval officers, land surveyors, mathematicians and life long flat earth researchers would literally be screaming from their rooftops for so many years that NASA has lied to us about the shape of the earth?</p>
<p>But I guess this massively growing movement is just stupid people being stupid right? Or crazy people who just can\'t seem to understand why the shape of our earth\'s continents and oceans have dramatically changed so much in size over the last 75 years. </p>
<p>Idiots, like myself, who simply can\'t wrap their head around when the shape of the earth shifted from a round ball to a pear?</p>
<p>I know what you\'re thinking...silly flat earther, he thinks that a subtle pear like bulge in the earth is something to get all hot and bothered about right?</p>
<p>Nope. Here\'s, NASA\'s spokesman\'s Neil deGrasse Tyson --- telling us that our earth has in fact quite the noticeable pot belly. </p>
<p>Check  it out at approximately minute 8:40. (Seems like Neil deGrasse is a super knowledgeable and honest guy right?)</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PBD7A-OMWyE">https://youtu.be/PBD7A-OMWyE</a></p>
<p>So um, after watching this muppet, my question is --- why has every single image of the earth, that has ever been shown to us from space --- has shown the earth to be a perfectly round ball?</p>
<p>But forgive me, I don\'t want to start to rant, that\'s not my style. Without further adieu: here are the 2 posts that got me banned from Reddit. Please enjoy. This is all I wrote and you will soon clearly see  that all I truly intended to do was bring a little fun, joy and laugher to an obviously painful and difficult post by the OP. Thank-you so much for reading. :)</p>

<p>TL:DR --- The Earth is Flat --- You are under a spell --- Time to Wake the F*** Up please. (Thanks!)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Here we go --- buckle up friend:</h2>
<h2>Friendly Post 1 --- in response to the OP --- Sent to you this morning --- because f*** corporate greed and censorship! </h2>
<p>I agree, Flat Earthers are without a doubt the pinnacle of hillbilly ignorance!</p>
<p>That is why I\'m so happy that reddit is an anonymous forum, where I may wonder without shame, why the NASA/SATAN space deception has never shown us any real time videos of people, places or things, walking around, upside down? (One would think, with all the trillions upon trillions dollars that we have poured into our space program, that they\'d have given us at least one &quot;money shot&quot; by now right?)</p>
<p>Just imagine, what an incredible sight it would be, to see a giant ship, on the bottom of the earth, gracefully gliding through the ocean? (Upside down) And not to be too picky, but at this point, would it be too much to ask for some kind of Pirate theme? </p>
<p>Oh I know! How about a live dolphin show from Sea World? That would just be too cool! </p>
<p>The possibilities are simply endless!!! :)</p>
<p>And please, please don\'t misunderstand me! I am well aware that our slightly wobbly and tilted &quot;Space Ship Earth&quot; does, without question, spin a whopping 1000 mph around a highly combustible burning ball of fire in the sky (our sun) --- which according to NASA, is also hurtling 600 000 miles per hour around a &quot;black hole&quot; in the centre of our galaxy. This totally seems legit.</p>
<p>Btw, did you know that the earth has moved? And that we are no longer in the outer edges of our milky way galaxy? TIL we are now halfway to the centre! Yee haw!!! Not to slut shame or anything, but it appears our solar system really gets around! By the time I hit 50, I\'d bet the farm that our earth will have slid &quot;sliders style&quot; right through a Black Hole! </p>

<p>And believe me when I say, that no one in their right mind, would ever dispute that of all that shakin\' and a bakin\' the earth does around in space, is why all the people on the bottom of the earth, who are walking around, upside down (from my perspective anyways --- which in case you can\'t tell --- is always from the top of the world) and is also why all the oceans, tigers, monkeys and hot dog stands have never once fallen off.  
</p>
<p>But, if you have an open mind, would you not agree that the NEVER ONCE PROVEN equation for Gravity has to be some kind of incredible, Grand Deception type magic spell or something, when we appreciate how it keeps the water in our oceans and the dust on my front porch stuck so securely to the ground, while still allowing a gravity defying fleet of fruit flies to follow my clementines around every day on the way to work?</p>
<p>Listen, I\'m not trying to be nuisance or anything here and I worry that I may have already rambled on for too long. And for that I am truly, very sorry. </p>
<p>All I\'m trying to say, is just that wouldn\'t it be really, really neat? And it wouldn\'t it also shut up all those Flat Earth morons once and for all, if NASA/SATAN would be so kind as to show the world a real time live video stream of me, sitting on a bench in Central Park, upside down while eating a replica of Donald Trumps hat.  
</p>
<h2>Thanks and have a great night! </h2>
<p>Friendly Post 2: In reference to a poster who thinks it\'s totally normal for our planes to leave such thick, chemical laden exhaust fumes in our beautiful blue sky --- to the point where these fumes begin block out the Sun. And was upset that people might get a little touchy about this subject.</p>
<hr />
<p>You make an excellent point. This world should never be taken too seriously, not with planes spraying chemicals in our sky or they FDA and Monsanto allowing poisons into our food and water supply. Anyone foolish enough to research these topics too seriously will surely go insane! </p>
<p>One moment, I just need to wipe some spittle and foam off my chins. Okay, I\'m good! :) </p>
<p>Anyhoo, wanna see something really neat? This is what our weather patterns would look like on flat earth:</p>

           And please, please don't misunderstand me! I am well aware that our slightly wobbly and tilted "Space Ship Earth" does, without question, spin a whopping 1000 mph around a highly combustible burning ball of fire in the sky (our sun) --- which according to NASA, is also hurtling 600 000 miles per hour around a "black hole" in the centre of our galaxy. This totally seems legit.
          </p>
          <p>
           Btw, did you know that the earth has moved? And that we are no longer in the outer edges of our milky way galaxy? TIL we are now halfway to the centre! Yee haw!!! Not to slut shame or anything, but it appears our solar system really gets around! By the time I hit 50, I'd bet the farm that our earth will have slid "sliders style" right through a Black Hole!

           And believe me when I say, that no one in their right mind, would ever dispute that of all that shakin' and a bakin' the earth does around in space, is why all the people on the bottom of the earth, who are walking around, upside down (from my perspective anyways --- which in case you can't tell --- is always from the top of the world) and is also why all the oceans, tigers, monkeys and hot dog stands have never once fallen off.
          </p>
          <p>
           But, if you have an open mind, would you not agree that the NEVER ONCE PROVEN equation for Gravity has to be some kind of incredible, Grand Deception type magic spell or something, when we appreciate how it keeps the water in our oceans and the dust on my front porch stuck so securely to the ground, while still allowing a gravity defying fleet of fruit flies to follow my clementines around every day on the way to work?

           Listen, I'm not trying to be nuisance or anything here and I worry that I may have already rambled on for too long. And for that I am truly, very sorry.
          </p>
          <p>
           All I'm trying to say, is just that wouldn't it be really, really neat? And it wouldn't it also shut up all those Flat Earth morons once and for all, if NASA/SATAN would be so kind as to show the world a real time live video stream of me, sitting on a bench in Central Park, upside down while eating a replica of Donald Trumps hat.

           Friendly Post 2: In reference to a poster who thinks it's totally normal for our planes to leave such thick, chemical laden exhaust fumes in our beautiful blue sky --- to the point where these fumes begin block out the Sun. And was upset that people might get a little touchy about this subject.

           You make an excellent point. This world should never be taken too seriously, not with planes spraying chemicals in our sky or they FDA and Monsanto allowing poisons into our food and water supply. Anyone foolish enough to research these topics too seriously will surely go insane!

            Flat earthers are like retarded religious nuts but, but worse. When you don't believe in things like gravity and try and point out how fruit flies...
            <em>
             fly
            </em>
            and think it's magic you're laughable at best. When you can't even fathom how math works and that the earth while still curving could also curve the other way (mountains, hills what have you) you lose any and all scientific credibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now i know I KNOW that pointing out your flaws won't change your mind that is grasping at straws so badly. But let's take one more idea, not even scientific, just to see how your brain "works". If I'm sailing transatlantically whats keeping me from slipping off the edge when I get to it? Maybe that magic your fruit flies have been huffing on.

            Hi Crensch,
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for bearing with me. :) For what it's worth, I apologize for coming across as an asshole/condescending.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             TL:DR --- Some more evidence compiled for your viewing pleasure below. Just skip to the end if you are not interested in my "origin story." Some of my beliefs will seem crazy, so again, just skip to the end for the flat earth proof please if you're not ready for the full truth.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            My rather eccentric beliefs can't really be proven and don't negate the NASA/SATAN Space Deception which you can actually see for yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please note: I have no anger towards you. You are asking all the normal questions a skeptic should ask, I just wish you'd save me the trouble and look it up for yourself lol. Or maybe just maybe, look at some of the videos or images I posted in my OP. But you're right, I guess the burden of proof is on me.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I am angry on behalf of All of Us:  :(
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://goo.gl/images/7kRH4p">
             https://goo.gl/images/7kRH4p
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And please note, I would never have considered the theory of flat earth either and am ashamed to admit that ignorantly, I had always assumed that Flat Earthers were all bunch of uneducated nitwits, but then found out just how sick and twisted our pedo satanic elite are during the pedogate scandal. And of course, already had a healthy hatred towards them due to 9/11 and all the other false flags over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            And of course, truly who doesn't despise the Catholic Church and the Islamic Elite? These sick freaks are literally soaked in the blood of the innocent. Pieces of fucking filth these elite assholes are. Btw, for what it's worth, I have a strong hunch that the Pope is the Antichrist --- but that's another rant.  (Don't worry I fucking hate the Jewish Elite too.)
           </p>
           <p>
            To be clear -- these fuckers aren't actually Jewish, Islamic or Christian --- they are Satanic/Luciferian hermaphrodite worshipping fucks.
           </p>
           <p>
            But even more then that --- they are actually being manipulated themselves by very low vibrational interdimensional entities. (What we now call Gray aliens/reptilians and our ancestors called Jinn and Demons) They are broken, hollowed out, fucked right up people who are actually tortured inside, most of the time. (Well of course, when they're not out fucking and cannibalizing little kids :(
           </p>
           <p>
            And the reason why I write the way I do is because, well obviously I'm a little crazy, but more then that, I am very pissed off about being lied to and what these "people" are up to and quite frankly, know that all of this is ridiculous. (But sadly true)
           </p>
           <p>
            I would much rather be waking and baking in my backyard blissed out with my dogs. But instead I'm just really fucking angry and can't sleep anymore because of this shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've always found the theory of relativity to be a little suspect. Just like the unproven theory of gravity, the theory of relativity, only passably fits into the mainstream narrative by making up an invisible type of matter (dark energy and dark matter) to explain 95% of the observable universe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was always taught that the evidence needed to match the theory? But I guess now know, that we can just make up 95% of the data and call it invisible.
           </p>
           <p>
            As well, I've always been very interested in forbidden archaeology and studied mainstream anthropology in school and was disgusted to find out about all of the interesting artifacts that have been censored over the years because they didn't fit the mainstream narrative. I always thought regular archaeology, sociology and psychology was a bit ridiculous, but studying Michael Tellinger, Graham Hancock and Michael Cremo's work, I realised that ancient archaeology is fascinating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evidence of Giants, advanced technology, advanced ancient civilizations now submerged underwater ect. (If you're interested I will link to that shit tomorrow.) What I liked about that stuff is that these researchers actually presented their evidence --- unlike the barely decipherable hypothetical thought experiments like the "theory of gravity" or "relativity." (Equations that no one has ever even come close to solving --- but hey, thank God Steven Hawking is on the case right? lol)
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, here is Neil deGrasse Tyson laughing at us when he admits their fuckery about the earth now being "pear shaped" with a noticeable pot belly:

           </p>
           <p>
            All I ask is that you try to shake off all of that disinformation we were taught in school, just for a moment at least and use your common sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now before you go looking at just one video and pulling it all apart --- look at them all --- and then explain to me why they are all wrong???

            Listen something really weird happened. I just posted a magnificent and inspiring rant in response to your incomprehensible argument against relativity or some bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I can't even find your original insult? Did you delete it 😔 you didn't have to do that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not trying to make you feel stupid, because all of us have been deliberately lied to and manipulated by evil people.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, just like so many people out there, I whole heartedly believed in the theory of Star Trek too.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's got to be so particularly frustrating to people like you who had to memorize all of that convoluted bullshit math and theorems in school.
           </p>
           <p>
            So yeah, in regards to the "the theory of relativity" --- as i said I'm not denying that this mathematical thought experiment almost passably fits into NASA/SATAN'S bullshit narrative of space.
           </p>
           <p>
            It certainly is a better attempt then Newton's theory of gravity which has never been proven and fills 3 large volumes of books with all of its mathematical musings. (Oh and did I mention that this remains unproven after what 400+ years?)
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess if I had to criticize "The theory of relativity" my only minor concern would be that in order for it to be true...it would mean that roughly 95% of all of the observable matter in the universe would have to be an invisible form of "exotic" energy called: "Dark Matter or Dark Energy."
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was in school, I was taught that the observable evidence has to match the theory, but I guess simple logic and common fucking sense doesn't apply to our elite NA/SATAN overlords.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also please answer me, if it's not too much trouble, when did the earth become pear shaped? Because all of these images given to us by SATAN over the years look pretty fucking round and CGI like to me.

            Thanks MrPong, I knew they manipulated our education, but had not read that. Really pisses me off and they do seem to have this need to be as evil as they can.
           </p>
           <p>
            I sometimes suspect I might come off a wee bit intense, but I don't know how to casual abou this, however as bitchy as I get, I don't want to force this on people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because it's not just as simple as flat earth. I strongly suspect that all of our reality is an illusion in that there is so much going on that we can't see.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I'm positive that our elite have found a way to fuck around with that. I think that is where the Mandela effect is coming from. And you know there has to be a reason why these secret societies are sacrificing and torturing kids. I really think this is demons.

            my only question to you, because I truly appreciate anyone kind enough to scan through my rants is this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you believe in secret societies? And if so, can you explain to me why they would only manipulate our religion, mass media and political systems?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would our education or scientific development not be affected? Are you so sure that everything you were taught in school is true?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it truly crazy to consider that a cult of satanic paedophilia might not put a high value on telling us the truth about say, the nature of our reality? Wouldn't we be a lot easier to control if we didn't think there was land beyond Antarctica or that space was a terrifying void of darkness?

            I truly don't believe that. You might not be able to tell from across the computer, but I am a very suspicious person and have researched flat earth, with the thought of proving a crazy theory wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it, just for a moment with an open mind, what can it hurt right?
           </p>
           <p>
            These ancient aliens that our ancestors called Demons or Jinn. When did they leave? And why do the cave paintings and satanic channellings show that they look so similar to Grey Aliens?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you must be well aware of 9-11 and Pedogate conspiracies and the suppression and ridicule we all face.
           </p>
           <p>
            So why would they suppress all of that, while encouraging UFO conspiracies??? People are constantly coming forward and leaking information without any reprisals that I have seen. And the CIA actually works hand in hand sometimes with film directors like Steven Spielberg to produce UFO/Alien themed movies and TV series.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is a reasonable suspicion to wonder if this is "Controlled opposition."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, if you believe in the illuminati and understand that they are evil, satanic, child molesting, tiny dicked freaks --- ask yourself --- just who do you think these fuckers are worshipping and sacrificing children to? Demons, Lucifier...
           </p>
           <p>
            This is my opinion, but I do support it with logic and facts. Unless you think I've lost a wheel, in which case, if you feel like it, tell me where I've gone wrong please. :)
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            You see, NASA doesn't give a shit if people argue about fake moon landings or "fossils on mars" --- they're just so fucking happy that people think it's possible that they could get into space.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Our ancestors were not wrong to call them Demons, we are the ones misguided into calling them Aliens. They are interdimentional beings and have been feeding off of humanity for a very very long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do you think our ancestors used to sacrifice people to their Gods? And just when did they stop?

             I agree, Flat Earthers are without a doubt the pinnacle of hillbilly ignorance!

            <p>
             That is why I'm so happy that reddit is an anonymous forum, where I may wonder without shame, why the NASA/SATAN space deception has never shown us any real time videos of people, places or things, walking around, upside down? (One would think, with all the trillions upon trillions of dollars that we have poured into our space program, that they'd have given us at least one "money shot" by now right?)
            </p>
            <p>
             Just imagine, what an incredible sight it would be, to see a giant ship, on the bottom of the earth, gracefully gliding through the ocean? (Upside down) And not to be too picky, but at this point, would it be too much to ask for some kind of Pirate theme?
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh I know! How about a live dolphin show from Sea World? That would just be too cool!
            </p>
            <p>
             The possibilities are simply endless!!! :)
            </p>
            <p>
             And please, please don't misunderstand me! I am well aware that our slightly wobbly and tilted "Space Ship Earth" does, without question, spin a whopping 1000 mph around a highly combustible burning ball of fire in the sky (our sun) --- which according to NASA, is also hurtling 600 000 miles per hour around a "black hole" in the centre of our galaxy. This totally seems legit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Btw, did you know that the earth has moved? And that we are no longer in the outer edges of our milky way galaxy? TIL we are now halfway to the centre! Yee haw!!! Not to slut shame or anything, but it appears our solar system really gets around! By the time I hit 50, I'd bet the farm that our earth will have slid "sliders style" right through a Black Hole!

             And believe me when I say, that no one in their right mind, would ever dispute that of all that shakin' and a bakin' the earth does around in space, is why all the people on the bottom of the earth, who are walking around, upside down (from my perspective anyways --- which in case you can't tell --- is always from the top of the world) and is also why all the oceans, tigers, monkeys and hot dog stands have never once fallen off.

            <p>
             But, if you have an open mind, would you not agree that the NEVER ONCE PROVEN equation for Gravity has to be some kind of incredible, Grand Deception type magic spell or something, when we appreciate how it keeps the water in our oceans and the dust on my front porch stuck so securely to the ground, while still allowing a gravity defying fleet of fruit flies to follow my clementines around every day on the way to work?

             Listen, I'm not trying to be nuisance or anything here and I worry that I may have already rambled on for too long. And for that I am truly, very sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
             All I'm trying to say, is just that wouldn't it be really, really neat? And it wouldn't it also shut up all those Flat Earth morons once and for all, if NASA/SATAN would be so kind as to show the world a real time live video stream of me, sitting on a bench in Central Park, upside down while eating a replica of Donald Trumps hat.

             Friendly Post 2: In reference to a poster who thinks it's totally normal for our planes to leave such thick, chemical laden exhaust fumes in our beautiful blue sky --- to the point where these fumes begin block out the Sun. And was upset that people might get a little touchy about this subject.

             You make an excellent point. This world should never be taken too seriously, not with planes spraying chemicals in our sky or they FDA and Monsanto allowing poisons into our food and water supply. Anyone foolish enough to research these topics too seriously will surely go insane!

              I'm not left unless the left wants to tear everything down and start fresh. I'm pretty sure the proper term is anarchist, but I'm opposed to loud noises and violence, so very shortly I will be packing up my shit and moving to an uninhabited forest, where I will make a new life for myself inside of a tree.

                lol I did not. I didn't ask you anything about the theory of relativity, you brought it up.

                You are the one making the assumption that the theory of relativity is correct. Not me, because I think it's bullshit.

               <p>
                Interesting in that in order for this theory to be correct, it would be mean approximately 95% of all observable matter in the universe would have to be an invisible form of exotic energy called "dark matter or dark energy."
               </p>

                I was always taught that the observable evidence had to match the theory, but I guess NASA and our satanic elite know better right?

                Do any of these pictures seem "pear like to you?" Because they look perfectly round and CGI/"cartoon like" to me.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I said, maybe I'm just an idiot who can't quite grasp why the shape of North America would have changed so dramatically in size in the pictures NASA has shown us from picture to picture year to year? Nor does it explain all of the CGI errors in the "live NASA ISS" feeds. The fuckers.

                 Just because you cannot see wind doesn't mean air particles aren't slamming against you when you feel a breeze.  You can observe the EFFECTS of something to determine that something is there.  You can even LABEL that unknown something as "dark matter" or "dark energy", and while the reality of the thing might be different later on, the EFFECTS of that unknown thing will be the same.

                 Yeah. You could educate yourself on these things, but you don't.  You take this petulant stance of "there's no COMMON SENSE to it, therefore it's wrong" - which is just emotional reasoning and really rather stupid.

                  You seem so angry bro.  😔😥😰
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I have offended your delicate sensibilities with the truth and accept that this is my fault and I am truly sorry.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In retrospect, perhaps I was a little rude. You see, I get a little defensive because people are so fucking brainwashed that they refuse to think beyond what they were taught in school. They refuse to consider that the same secret societies that controlled our relgions, mass media and governments might just get a kick out of holding back our education and scientific development.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But obviously you're not like that though...you've looked at all of the pictures, research and videos I presented just for you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Wait what, no you didn't? You refused because you know better right? And instead just garbled back all that fucking bullshit you were taught in school without answering any of my questions?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Let me be clear. I've never been to space either. I don't have any answers. I just have a lot of questions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For example:
                 </p>
                 <ol>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    Why is the earth now pear shaped (and again this is not a little bulge according to NASA/NAZI/SATAN) when every single picture ever shown to us of the earth from space depicts the earth as perfectly round?
                   </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    Why has the shape of North America drastically changed in size from picture to picture, year to year? Again according to NASA?
                   </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    Why are there so many places that we shouldn't be able to see (because of the curvature of the earth) that we can see?
                   </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    Why did I get to watch an entire space ship and crew explode into pieces on live tv back in the 80s only to find out that all these astronauts/actors miraculously survived?
                   </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   <p>
                    How can you not see the absurdity in being fed a theory that is so far off base that it can't explain 95% of the observable universe and instead makes up an invisible type of matter that can only be conceptualized with insanely complex and convoluted equations --- that has never even been proved?!
                   </p>

                 </ol>
                 <p>
                  This exotic "dark matter" and "dark energy"

                  Come on man. They're just fucking laughing at all of us. 😡
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Do you not understand how fucking evil these people are who have been running our countries?!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They literally fuck and cannabalize children, but you don't think they'd lie to you about say, the very nature of reality?!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At least keep an open mind. That is all I'm asking!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The whole thing is absurd, i know, but then so is child eating politicians and sadly, we know how long that's been going on. (Since the beginning of time would be my guess)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Just YouTube NASA ISS fails and i truly believe you will get a sense at how ridiculous the world wide space program is.

                  But smarty pants, if you'd be so kind, rather then insult me --- please educate me and answer those 5 questions.

You just post it all in one big diarrhea gish-gallop post that was probably written by someone else somewhere and it made you feel good to copy and paste it.

                      And You are the one arguing with me using a "never once been proven"mathematical thought experiment "the theory of relativity" and believe it or not, "Gravity"  that in fact has no basis in reality.

                           A reply to your own OP is not a reply to me, you shady fuck.  You hate deception but it's taken you thins long to even begin to support your claims.

                           I'm not going to trudge through a huge TL;DR.  I already said I wouldn't.  So stop responding to me directly with shifty-fuck language and get after it point by point as we go.  Just as with your stupid non-reply comment, I could just hand-wave you to some flat-earth debunking site with some rambling, irrelevant narrative or life's story with it.

Nobody will give a fuck *because to debunk it they'd need more than an hour

                        I'm sorry bro, I honestly don't even know how respond. I'm trying to explain that all of that stuff we were taught in school is basically fairy tales disguised as science and history, yet you keep using it as a defence,  somehow thinking that it proves me wrong.

                        I was really hoping to share some delightful memes with the pedo-satanic elite on Twitter, but okay, for you, I will dig up a collection of ISS bloopers and fails, locations that you shouldn't be able to see because of the curvature of the earth, that NASA crew that blew up in the 80s who are now alive, the cgi images of the earth that show that North America keeps changing in size from picture to picture. And my favourite course when our perfectly round Spaceship Earth turned into a pear.

                        Again, all of that is nicely summarised in the video I linked, which is why, you know, I linked it. But you really seem fixated on this...so, I guess what can it hurt.

                         When you are challenging the currently accepted narrative and attempting to push one of your own, the onus is on you to put in the effort to change others' minds.  Even you admit that it's the default, so why, exactly, do you think others will go out of their way to dig through a pile of shit to find what convinced you?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         You admit above that I'll probably discount some right away - how do you know this?  Is that not the same stuff that convinced you?  If it's not,
                         <strong>
                          then why did you provide it?

                         All of which, even if true, do not necessarily mean the world is flat, but somehow merely discounting the accepted narrative, in your opinion,
                         <em>
                          must
                         </em>
                         lead one to a flat earth hypothesis.

                        <p>
                         How about you provide proof of the flat earth instead of trying to disprove the current narrative?

                             Moreover, with extremely long bullshit comments, you get to hide your failures in the massive amount of SHIT you post by merely not responding to the points that were shown to be absurd.

                            <p>
                             You'll just ignore that they happened, push the ones that weren't completely destroyed, then bring up the destroyed ones again later, since they were lost in the huge mass of other bullshit before.  Again, if you cannot stop using the gish-gallop, you will never convince someone of even average intelligence.

                               How is taking each sentence as a thought "out of context"?  I'm responding point by point to you, and the fact that you have an issue with it just proves that even you realize you cannot win where each idea is examined and discussed.  How ironic that you think of going point-by-point is deceptive; you really are fucked in the head.

                                   If a 5'4"-ish person were standing on, say, the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, and let's just say their eyes are at an even 5' from the ground, they could see a flashlight

                                   The Earth has a radius of ~3965 miles.  Using Pythagorean theroem, that calculates to an average curvature of the earth of 7.98 inches per mile.  INCHES. PER. MILE.  That skyline is 30 miles away, but somehow we're not supposed to see it?  ABSURD.

                                   Of the first two videos, exactly zero source their video content to something official, so finding the original footage to compare it to some random-fuck youtuber is not really feasible.  Also, many of the focused-on parts are quite absurd, like a "magic orange" ... how insanely inane that is, and not at all convincing, but this poster took the time to post it.  So all I have to go on is this uploaded video of someone that thinks a "magic" orange is convincing.

                             See, this is dishonest.  I've told you at least three times that you can start here by making a point and supporting it, but all you do is gishgallop another long comment.  If that's all you're capable of, then yeah, you won't ever get through to me... or probably anyone else for that matter.

                             Why do you keep putting energy into this irrelevant, sad excuse for banter, but you won't have a point-by-point here, or apparently even have the cods to not lie about either not having the answers, or having the answers?  You know, only one of those can be true.

                             Tell me what you believe, why, and what convinced you.  Don't do this in a novel nobody will read, it isn't that complicated and everyone knows it.  Here, let me help you out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             1)  "I believe X - Here's a brief explanation why, and here's 1 to 2 relevant links on it."
                            </p>
                            <p>

                             The above is more or less the only way anyone is going to take you seriously, as posting a bunch of bullshit all at once is not only bad form on the internet, but if you're espousing a fringe belief, you are signalling to those that do not share your beliefs that you have no intention of arguing honestly, but instead will pile on bullshit that will cost them more time and effort than they're willing to spend.

                             You can spew enough bullshit in 5 minutes to cause someone wanting to correct you an hour's worth of work.  Nobody,

                 It's real, REAL simple: The tactic you used in OP is called "gish gallop", where you present so much half-truth and outright falsehoods that it'd take someone hours to respond to it properly.  That's what all of you do.

             did you read the rest of the post though? Does a wobbly, tilted pear shaped rock that is spinning 1000mph on axis around a ball of fire in the sky (the sun) which is also spinning 100 000 mph around a black hole --- not sound a little far fetched?

              If you're riding in the back seat of a bus going 50mph and you throw a beer to the driver at 10mph, you would experience that beer moving at 10mph.

              Someone standing at the side of the road watching this as the bus drives by would see that can moving at - WAIT FOR IT - 60mph!  Isn't that a little far fetched?

              It's called relativity.  Calculations using the models that cause those to not be so far fetched are what make GPS systems work.

               Listen, I believe you when you say that the theory of relativity very neatly fits into the bullshit fake narrative paradigm that the pedo-cannabalistic satanic elite have invented.
              </p>
              <p>
               But, is it not at least a little bit concerning to you that NASA is now saying the shape of the earth is a pear?
              </p>
              <p>
               And again, it's not a tiny little bulge that they're talking about here. Or a minor, cosmetic blubble that we can only see from outer space. No they are literally saying that our very own Mother Gaia is fat. Wtf is that shit? It is literally our...humanity's Mother that NA-SATAN is fat shaming.
              </p>
              <p>
               At least watch the fucking video. The soundtrack is absolutely haunting!

               If you have the time and dare to consider that the satanic cult of paedophiles that have manipulated our religions, political systems and mass media, might just maybe have controlled and held back our education and scientific development, then I strongly recommend starting perhaps with this video. Then recommend researching whatever you think is bullshit for yourself. That's what I did.

               And honestly man, regarding the vacuum of space, I think everything that have taught us about that is all bullshit. I don't trust a think NASA or any of the other space programs tell me, because obviously these fuckers are all working together.

              <p>
               What do you think about the NASA astronauts that we watched "die" on live tv back in the 80s, only to find out they are still alive?
              </p>
              <p>
               I would bet the farm, that space is water. And that's why we see all these "jelly fish" type ufos in low space orbit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those rod-type UFOs that many people have spotted for years, very likely are, as suspected --- biological, aquatic creatures.

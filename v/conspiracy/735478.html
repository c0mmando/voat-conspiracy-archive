            We had training at my work for an active shooter situation and it was pretty similar to this video except the last point was that if there is no other option you are to fight for your life.

            It really is our only option if we aren't allowed the tools to blow the fuckers heads off their shoulders.

            It would have gone completely differently in Paris if ten percent of the crowd were carrying at the Bataclan.

             Dubious to that. Basically you're saying you're in a pressure situation, where I'm assuming you're likely to have fuck all fine motor skills, that you're going to be able to draw your weapon, load a bullet into the camber, remove the safety etc, acquire the target and let off a round accurate to drop the dude. Yeah, I'm calling bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do some research into these shootings and I'll tell you what is likely to happen:
            </p>
            <p>
             You're walking along thinking about what kind of coffee you going to get. Suddenly you may hear gun fire, if you're lucky enough to have not had your head blown off on the first folly, you would likely either freeze or drop to the ground while your mind tries to take in what the hell is happening, by the time you've stopped hesitating and worked that it's some gutless cunt who's started firing into the crowd they've probably already emptied whatever they have in their magazine and ran away.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suppose it's possible that if they're mental enough they might try to reload to have another go. And I suppose that in that space of time you might have the opportunity to draw your weapon - if you remember that you have it - load and shoot the guy - despite that fact that your whole body would be shaking like jello, no matter how stone cold you think you are. And you might be able to fire off maybe a few rounds. But the more likely thing to happen is that you'll either just blow your own balls off, shoot some innocent bystander, or the guy will simply notice you're packing heat and shoot you while you're still fumbling with your weapon. All just down to the mental space you're in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell, even if by some miracle you're able to hit them then it's still possible that they're able to do huge amounts of damage. Contrary to Hollywood it's possible that people still able to operate even if they've have been hit by gunfire for at least some time. Also, if they're at least organised I.E., terrorists, then you'd assume that they would be at least intelligent enough to stagger their firing so you would have one guy firing while the other guy was loading. The trend with these guys seems to be in working in teams two now rather than your individual psycho that you used to have to worry about. So it's possible that you wouldn't even get that opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying that it's not possible to drop the guy just that it's unlikely. And it seems to me that if you look at things objectively - disregarding the politics - that purely in the context of these situations where the gunman or potential gunmen very much have all of the initiative that it's unlikely that even if you have a weapon that you're going to be that much good at all in returning fire.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suppose if you're charitable that it's possible that maybe the situation will degenerate into a hostage situation or the gunman may start opening up closets or looking under tables to kill potential victims that have sort refuge, where camping with a gun pointed at the entrance may kill the dude, but to me it doesn't look like it would matter much if you were packing or not. Due to the unlikeliness of this situation IMHO.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry but concealed carrying while there may be other good arguments for it is not going to be solution to mass shootings if you research how these events usually go down. I.E., quick and brutal attacks conducted by cowards.

              Most people who are practiced with weapons are:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) not going to go lizard brain at the sound of gunfire, they'll probably stay composed and think to identify the source of the shot
             </p>
             <p>
              2) not going to "folly around with the safety" because any sensible gun owner, especially one who intends to carry will know how to use the damn thing.

               The question is whether someone is able to use a gun in a sudden pressure situation not whether they're able to use the thing or not. Like I said most of these situations are short brutal attacks conducted by cowards that last seconds rather than minutes. Even if you were trained and had a weapon and were in a position to retaliate I would doubt that even then you could. This goes especially if you are not.
              </p>
              <p>
               You seem to think that just owning a weapon automatically means that someone is going to be as skilled as a Navy Seal. By that logic then having a gym membership would automatically make someone as fit as a Olympic athlete.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just because someone has a weapon doesn't mean that they would be any use in such a situation and would more likely be a hindrance. Hell, the people that are supposed to be trained at dealing with these types of events, the police, tend to be pretty crap themselves, half the time.

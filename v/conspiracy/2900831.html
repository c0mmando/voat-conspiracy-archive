<p>they are endorsed by unsavory figures like noam chomsky, ( meet noam chomsky, academic gatekeeper <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=EEDf7OkRCxk">https://hooktube.com/watch?v=EEDf7OkRCxk</a> ), steven greer, a rockefeller shill ( how to fake an alien invasion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM4tkJGSSaU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM4tkJGSSaU</a> ),  they rely on occultists / satanists like mark passio (a fake name, a hallmark of conmen and scammers), cia assets like robert david steele, conmen like david seaman.  sasha stone (another conman, not his real name) ...  was there also a bishop? those are totally not pedofiles!! right?!</p>
<p>the chairroom is a typical red-black satanist color scheme and to say nothing of the word \'commission\' - the commies are all satanists to begin with.  i could go on...  yeah, the thrive movie they are pushing is also full of new age mumbo-jumbo, theosophy, satanism, masonic symbology and ideas.  all poison for your mind.</p>
<p>their faq is also oozing satanism:</p>
<p>“The pine cone motif in the ITNJ’s logo denotes the pineal gland in homo sapiens. It is the organ within the human brain which connects our mechanical intelligence to our meta~intelligence, ie: our capacity to see outside the box, ergo to step outside the proverbial matrix. It is therefore the anchor point of our consciousness to the heavenly realms.</p>
<p>“The language of law (legalese) has been, and continues to be, a veiled language, by its very design. The (mis)use of words and meanings equates to spellbinding. The ritualised majick that law has been subverted toward has not served humankind, but has contrarily conspired to delude us from our higher expression.</p>
<p>The ITNJ is breaking these invisible bonds and re-purposing the language of law. It is reclaiming jurisprudence and restoring the foundational axis of Trust and Equity.</p>
<p>The ‘figure of eight’ symbol on the lateral plane in the ITNJ logo alludes to the cycle of infinity. This denotes an absolutist approach by the ITNJ to pure-truth. Pure-truth is not by degrees, and where it is enshrined will ever serve to anchor the heavens to the causal realm.”</p>
<p>like, give me a fucking break</p>

this is not a new banking alternative, this is the same old templar criminal tax havens of jersey, guernsey, isle of man etc, where crimial money laundering and child trafficking is the core business model.  only 100000 EUR and more are accepted? oh, its all for the little man i see. /s</p>
<p>oh and the United People Foundation ?  its a PO box!  :-))))</p>

            Oh and it gets so much better:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Numerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured shortly afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             However, in 1955, under broad political pressure,
             <strong>
              the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba
             </strong>
             , including the Moncada attackers.
             <strong>
              Fidel's Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Raúl in the release.[35]
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Do I really need to comment? Focus on the whole thing: this history makes absolutely no sense. Why would Batista basically hand over power to Castro like this? Do you honestly think if this had been you that you wouldn't have gotten the death sentence for trying to overthrow the government, much less released from prison due to
            <em>
             political pressure
            </em>
            ?!

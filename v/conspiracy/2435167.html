Much like how DNA, a chemical compound within every single cell of a body, contains the information to recreate the entire human. A great metaphor to describe this is the Sutra of &quot;Indra\'s Net&quot;:
&quot;Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each &quot;eye&quot; of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering &quot;like&quot; stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring.&quot;</p>
<p>In this metaphor the jewels represent protons. Nassim Haramein tackled what\'s known as the \'vacuum catastrophe\' (a mathematical problem that arises when you add up the number of vacuum fluctuations in a unit of space, as the mass that is calculated comes out absurdly larger than that which is actually measured in that same unit of space - for example: when adding up the vacuum fluctuations in a cubic centimetre of space you yield 1093 grams, whereas if you were to take all the measurable mass of the observable universe and squish it into that same space you\'d get 1055 grams) by figuring out how we can derive the mass of matter from the fundamental planck unit. When you divide the volume of a proton by the volume of a planck sphere unit (a spherical unit of energy of planck length diameter, proposed by Nassim to be one of these fundamental \'bits\' of information that make up the universe) and then multiply by the planck mass, you come out with the mass of the observable universe: 1055 grams. This shows that the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit into a proton - when the planck spheres are stacked in a 3 dimensional <a href="https://gfycat.com/TenderLateEmperorshrimp">&quot;flower of life&quot; formation</a> (as opposed to being stacked in a <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faH_PCj4KYY/UDAvatnFtHI/AAAAAAAABDc/-xZuTez_JKk/s1600/SimpleCubicPack.jpg">cubic formation</a>) - equals the measurable mass of the observable universe.</p>
<p>But obviously that\'s not what we see when we measure the mass of a proton. Due to the size:mass ratio of the proton it fulfills the Schwartzschild condition for a black hole. Once we consider the proton to act as a black hole we can borrow a mathematical concept from string theory - the holographic principle - which states that the surface information of a black hole can encode the volume information. When you apply this, and divide the surface planck spheres by the volume planck spheres and then multiply by the planck mass, you arrive at the measured proton\'s rest mass of ~10-24 grams.</p>
<p>Each proton in the universe holographically contains the information of every other proton in the universe. And every surface planck sphere of every acts as a wormhole terminations which connect all protons via a superfluid/superconducting aether, allowing instantaneous information transfer between all protons via an instantaneous information feedback-loop network.</p>
<p>It\'s this universal instantaneous feedback-loop network that gives rise to consciousness at a universal scale. And from there, due to the fractal self-configuring/self-evolving nature of the system, consciousness evolves to form higher and higher orders of self-complexity within the system.</p>',

            These are the most important, and relevant, aside from factual maths. The equations and theories themselves however, are abstractions designed to quantify more abstractions. Math is binary, not frequency.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cube + the Lotus = Dekahedron within dimensional space. Trans dimensional space is not dependent on light, density, matter, or weight. Unfortunately, those concepts are tied to Gravity falsely. Trans dimensional space is the extrapolation of wavelengths and waveforms caused by light, density, matter, or weight.
           </p>
           <p>
            A sufficient vibratory level would create a parameter the matches the parameter of a Dekahedron. If an object is vibrating along a central axis relative to the object's whole and mass (equal distribution of the object, along its own central axis points, will create the physical sensation and visual presentation of dekahedron) it will traverse a dimension of light or expel a modality of matter, into another "space".
           </p>
           <p>
            Ether is considered the carrier of the photon, and also often referenced as Dark Matter. Dark Matter is jargon, and may be deliberate obfuscation or code. Vibration and frequency identify the lotus, and various other organic geometric fractal forms. Where as the Square, or Cube, is never identified within nature. And with this, I'll sublimate poor evidence in this post with the iconic image of the Vitruvian Man (still coded); Which identifies man made space, and human mobility within man made spaces. It is a heuristic map for ergonomics within the material world.

            None of us subscribe to the trite cliché of a holographic universe.
What a waste of energy...

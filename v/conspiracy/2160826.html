             well we get told its adhd. if i put you in a room with others like you, then who has adhd? one of two will be more intollerable than the rest and now those are the adhd prone and the rest are normal according to their piers performance.
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: if you have adhd and go into an all black shitfest school learning the most mundane things and score higher, you wont have adhd anymore. thats the only known cure

            I will explain how medication helps me. This is what it’s like. I was diagnosed years ago. I went on and off Adderrall 3 different times. When I am on Adderral, it’s like night and day. My mind wakes up and I get into art. I do art every single day of my life now. I love to read and research. When I’m not on Adderral, my mind is like a zombie. I watched a lot of tv. I would be bored everywhere I went. On Adderral, my mind becomes alive again and my creative side comes out and I barely even watch tv. I’m much less forgetful as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s very hard to live with. But I also have hilarious stories because of my ADHD. I’m so forgetful and distracted that I come off so dingy. I’m not even joking, one time my friend and I went to Starbucks around the corner from my house. I was wearing flip flops and didn’t want to have tan lines so I took them off as we sat outside drinking our coffees. As we were walking to the car in the parking lot, we got into an interesting conversation. I stepped into the car and put my flip flops on the ground to slip my feet into them before I got in. My phone rang and I got distracted. When we pulled up to my house and I was about to get out, I realized that when I got distracted, because of my phone ringing while in the parking lot, that I forgot one flip flop. 🤣 We went back and it was still there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have so many crazy stories because ADHD is so much more than just about attention. I’ve done so much research. I don’t think so many children should be put on medication. Only if it’s really bad. Adderral affects people with ADHD differently than it would a normal person. It’s not like meth where I go tweak or clean house all day. It’s like my creative side comes alive. I’m interested in learning and more curious.
           </p>
           <p>
            I look back now and see why I had such a hard time in school. I wish that ADHD was recognized back then. People with ADHD will hyperfocus on things they like. Especially interactive things like being on the computer and video games. But on things they don’t like, they get distracted so easily. They get bored. Their mind will wander. Math was pure hell for me.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are different teaching methods that are best for people with ADHD. I retain a lot less with audio than visual. I had all kinds of tests done. So someone with ADHD does much better when they learn in a way that’s interactive. Or not just listening to someone, but by having, say a lecturerer, having something visual, like on a projector or something to go along with speaking. It makes it much easier to pay attention. If you don’t have that option, then someone with ADHD should take notes so that they take in more by also visually seeing it. Those are tips anyone can use. But, especially if you suffer from ADHD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, make habits. Put your keys in the same place everyday. People with ADHD are forgetful and disorganized. Make to do lists. I could go on and on. Researching really helped me to learn strategies to help. But, medicine makes my mind not live in a zombie state. So for me, I like both medication and using strategies I’ve learned.

            But, ADHD goes very deep and involves a lot more than the name implies. It affects my daily life. I’ve researched it for years. People can call it whatever they want. But it’s very real.

            ADHD/ADD does exist for sure. The mass medication thing is definitely a problem though. But someone gets more money for pushing pills so it works out the only way it matters (fuck all of you, I GOT MY NEW YACHT!). That is Capitalism, including the corruption that leverages monopolies and crushing or merging of all rivals.

            While I agree with you that ADHD is real, I also think that there's definitely some shady shit revolving around it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my own experience with it. When I was in elementary school, I was deemed the "bad kid" in the class, constantly getting in trouble, had horrible grades, etc. My teacher decided that I had ADHD, and so my parents took me to a Psychiatrist. After testing, they decided that yes, I had ADHD. My parents, being the Boomers they are, just asked "Is there a pill to fix him?" And the Psychiatrist answered that there was a treatment, my parents said "fantastic" and got my prescription, but didn't do any of the followup stuff required for ADHD, because the pills were supposed to "fix" me. Obviously, being the Boomers they were, they couldn't be arsed with the responsibility of making sure I took my pills, threw the bottle at me, and told me I was old enough to handle it on my own. Naturally, being an elementary schooler, I never saw that bottle again. However, magically, I suddenly stopped getting in trouble all together, my grades skyrocketed, and I became a model student. The only difference is that the school THOUGHT I was on pills.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few years ago, I was having trouble in some of my college classes, I remembered that I was diagnosed with ADHD, and thought that maybe it was holding me back some. I didn't remember much about my pill regiment, but I talked to my doctor about the possibility of getting medicated again. He looked at my file, told me that I had only received one bottle of pills, that had never been refilled. He also said that since I got as far as I have without pills, that I most likely never had ADHD, and was falsely diagnosed.

            Unfortunately you're trying to talk to people who haven't had the joy of experiencing it first hand. I once was on the other side of the fence in my beliefs, then my first born happened. Unfortunately the medications they offer do not help him at all. We home school with great struggling and I'm pretty sure he'll never fit in anywhere. My hopes are that he some how won't care, even though it's become obvious that it matters to him already. :(

            I do have ADHD. I didn't start taking Adderall until after college when I got my first office job. I do think it's real, but also think people should find their own coping messages and not take drugs until they need to. That being said, it is not safe for me to drive more then just across town without my Adderall, I also walk into things, knock things over, break things and am very much less observant without it, it's horrible.  However, I only take it on days I'm driving a lot or working.

             I have a fear of pills because I was given Ritalin (some form of slow release bullshit) at a young age and hated it but the doctors assured my family it was good even though I barely ate and stayed up all night. It's just a drug, you do not need it. Eat better food, love them coffees and nicotine gums if you smoked, just try and be clean. Best way to live, you'll even think better after a while

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               An award-winning Wall Street Journal reporter has been found dead in suspicious circumstances at his New York home whilst he was in a middle of an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s ties to a Russian drug company.
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <p>
               He was reportedly investigating Hillary’s involvement in the purchase of Russian drug company Veropharm by Abbot Labs at a time in 2014 when sanctions against Russia would have prevented the sale.
              </p>
              <p>
               The purchase was accomplished by a US shell company named Kew Garden Hills, LLC (registered in Delaware –and- Hillary Clinton’s home State of New York) acquiring approximately 98% of Veropharm shares—and then their being bought by Abbott Laboratories.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillary has ties to both Abbot Labs and Kew Garden Hills LLC.Critical to note about Abbott Laboratories acquiring Veropharm, this report explains, is that it was accomplished on 12 December 2014—which was 9 months from the March 2014 Obama regimes sanctions against Russia prohibiting such company takeovers—and that only someone with Hillary Clinton’s power and lust for money could make happen.

            Out of curiosity, heavy metals can also induce excitability. Before people knew mercury was neurotoxic, it was inhaled as a health promoting mist giving coffee-like stimulation. Just makes me think if observed changes in brain composition is genetics, or are these kids being poisoned in some way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well I guess this doesn't fully cover ADHD, but it's not completely out of its scope either. However that's just one heavy-metal. There are so many more possibilities, including pesticides and herbicides or other neurologically active agents.

           <blockquote>

             Short‐chained alkyl mercury and elemental mercury produce a constellation of neurological abnormalities collectively referred to as erethism. Erethism includes anxiety, irritability, mania, sleep disturbance, depression, and cognitive deficits. Visual disturbance, hearing loss, paresthesias, and tremor may also be present.

            Is hunter vs farmer a false dichotomy? Children are being drugged on an unprecedented scale just for being "unruly". And if ADHD did have some evolutionary usefulness in the past, and since we were all hunters at one point, then why doesn't everyone have ADHD?

            I've never believed ADHD was real, just because that is my own conclusion I came to after doing critical thinking about it.. It isn't any thing you can see in a microscope or blood test; It is just arbitrarily labelled to kids that want to be kids and aren't ready to be boring adults yet by sitting in class for literally hours every day and read and study..

            If your child's school says he has ADD/ADHD the kid is probably just bored or they need you to medicate them so they can be more effectively indoctrinated.

             I agree. I'm telling my teachers (they aren't my kids teachers in my mentality) to listen to me. if they don't, they lose the money given to them by the med society.  Those aren't people I care about. If they died, normalcy would ensue. No less able as a parent after that. What does that tell you?  Fuck those bugs

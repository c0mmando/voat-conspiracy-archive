            Mass causality event gone live. Recorded gunfire pipped over a speaker system. Professionally taken and composed photos of the crisis actors who were pre-arranged in the audience area. After 60+ minutes of 'Active shooter', all the real civilians had exited the audience area allowing the 'victim scenarios' to be played out in photography and camera phone (the 'my mom is a nurse' guy going around telling us everyone's injuries (see it is real everyone!!), yet slowed down we see absolutely nothing except fake blood esp on his fingertips lol). Any real injured will be from crowd crush, panic and falling over. Strobe light a distraction. The brothers interview 'explains' too much , attempting to account for every possible loose end including " of course he did this alone" = how would he really know??, if this entire thing is so bewildering and unbelievable to him. So many inconsistencies here. The police have basically already concluded the investigation, (less than a full 24hrs) dismissing things that they have not had time to properly investigate. So this guy is probably very much still alive- the death photo is the part of this event which tells the public "nothing to see here, all finished move along". The idea of metal detectors and gun amendments, less privacy seems accurate and intended.

            You can see the blinking light in this video, which was taken about two hours before the shooting.

            Where's the rest of that video?  There's an earlier portion where you can see what seems to coincide with shots being fired from a window on a lower floor and in concert/alternating with shots being fired from above.  I can't tell if the "blinky" window is the same as the one in the earlier part of the video.  Well...I guess I could go look it up...just wondering why that part was cut out?

            I think it's important to realize that it is totally feasible for one guy with all those guns to cause the carnage he did. Easy!
Occam's razor. Even if it was a deep state conspiracy why both with a second shooter when one could do the job just fine.
The difference in noise appearing to indicate 2 shooters are more likely echo, supersonic crack, change of shooting postition and change of weapon.
The evidence isn't there, you're clutching at straws. Focus on if he was a Patsy or more likely an Antifa sympathizer
Just my 2 cents

            Assuming the footage wasn't tempered or manufactured, it's safe to say that the loudest and the farthermost sounds were two distinct locations and not caused by echos in such open air. There was also moments when the sound was in the midrange of those two extremes.

            So someone put a flashing light in the window 20+ floors down from the shooter, on this very occasion? Quite the coincidence...I'm not saying it's "not" a flashing light but it does beg the question of who put it there and why? Was it connected to the event?

            The fourth floor bullshit was debunked before it even started. Anyone who really wished to know what was going on was listening to the police scanner as everything happened. They did not switch to a private channel, you could hear everything the local police were doing. You could hear them as they announced the floor they began to search and also when they finished searching the same floor. I heard them as they began to search the 3rd, 4th floor etc and nothing happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we need to focus on is if this was a staged event- if the shooter found in the room was a scapegoat and the true motive behind the attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay informed. Here's a former neighbor of the supposed shooter expressing his doubt on the current narrative.

            Really good find. It does seem that it's just some sort of flashing light that keeps flashing weather there is gunfire or not.

            Meh - there was machine gun fire coming out of that other window - it is unmistakably clear there are multiple shooters here.

            i believe it. and I also believe you niggers need to recognize an attack on voat when we see it.

            all new false flags are backed with fagots ready to post fake shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            fortunately, physics and basic commonsense defeats the fagots again.

            but they're orchestrating these false flags with the eState in mind.

             I've seen a couple of "muzzle flash" videos, from different floors. My theory: it could be. a reflection of the actual muzzle flash, off some piece of shiny something away from the building.
            </p>
            <p>
             So for one video, the reflection back to the building is on the 10th floor, and for another, in a different place at a different angle, the reflection is off the 3rd floor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or it may not be a muzzle flash at all.

            Big hotel. Must have been dozens of guests coming to or going  from their rooms. If not, were they being prevented from leaving or going to their rooms or certain floors? If any of these people speak up and are not intimidated to remain silent, they should be witnesses to which floor they heard the gun fire coming from.

              No, if it was 'sound waves echoing' the pattern would be the same, and it's not.  Two very distinct gunfire patterns.

             Thus far, this is the best and the longest video that has surfaced taken from inside a taxi that records the rapid-fire and interruptions. It certainly sounds as though it was coming from at least 2 directions.

             He's the first shots sound like they have an echo. The second set could be from his other window. Also keep in mind he rotates what gun he's using or else they'd over heat from too much use.

             Excellent find, thanks for posting. Sounds like two different shooters and one gun does sound like it has a bump stock due to the irregular rate of fire.

             That's clearly multiple shooters! I hear at least three different locations.

            <p>
             Edit: be very suspicious if the footage is too limited. There should be more recordings from other independent bystanders.

             Yup, the flash looked like what a video game designer would make a gun shot look like.

             The images clearly show it being on the high floor, and what does the conspiracy sub gain from proving that it was on the 3rd floor? What the hel ldo they gain????

            The police scanner audio talked about that light briefly. But they ruled it as just a flashing light. I highly recommend that audio footage for anyone interested in this, very illuminating.

                It’s a slippery slope.  This may turn into goddamn Reddit with fucking bots everywhere. We should have made a stand about no bots being allowed for manipulating or sliding comments.

                     I said he uses a bot to get CCP and also comments as a person in the same account. That is shady and why bots shouldn’t be allowed on voat. He can use his farmed CCP to control this site via upvoats and downvoats.

               Then go to his profile and look on the right side. There's a "block" button. This prevents you from receiving notifications from that person and automatically collapses their comments. I don't know about posts though.

                I want to show you how you’re wrong, but I keep getting a 403 on the profile page to show you.

               <p>
                However., voat’s block has never been a block. Collapsing comments... fuck that shit.

               <p>
                You see a new submission with one comment and you want to join, then it’s this fucking bot.
               </p>
               <p>
                It’s not a block. Fuck your holier than thou attempt at telling me I am wrong.

            If TPTB cede control, they'll induce a currency collapse to contain the actions of the successor. Then, they can recast themselves as the responsible option. I suspect this may happen. A currency collapse would also allow several regional powers to emerge, which could be re-recruited to provide an air of legitimacy.

            They're always one step ahead. I think it's laughable when we just got to see tons of evidence of the mass amount of corruption between politics and media yet somehow people seem to thing the other arm of the exact same corrupt system is going to fix everything

            It's a fair question to ask but logically it doesn't appear the case.  The strongest argument is simply how risky it is.  One could have achieved the same effect by taking a known politician and having them suddenly go off-script and take the role of the people's champion.  With the power of the establishment pulling strings they could have taken any random Congressman or Governor and elevated them with a few publicity stunts - remember how that guy on CNBC went on a "rant" and got tons of press?  Something along those lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump and Sanders managed to achieve this by having good timing and a lack of competition.  This shows just how hungry the population was for such a thing and I believe it's an accident of establishment arrogance that it happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, you have to consider the goals of the "new world order." Clearly they've been on team one-world-government for many, many years.  Trump is basically running on a "dismantle the American Empire" platform in a society that doesn't even really know the Empire exists.  His proposals are extremely radical (yet exceedingly popular) in the context of the policies we've had in the post-WW2 era.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is simply a person who, like many others, saw the impending doom over the horizon.  The difference is he realized he could get elected because he's famous, has media savvy, and had enough money to fund a campaign.  He understood that one has to get past a party primary to have a shot and he devised a strategy to do just that - run on the GOP side and be bombastic and over the top.
           </p>
           <p>
            His negative tactics are far beyond the "acceptable" discussion in our political system.  He has destroyed the legitimacy of dozens of political leaders and discredited their entire system as well as their propaganda outlets.  His campaign is scorched-earth against the establishment and if it failed there would be nothing to fall back on.  The opposition, meanwhile, is throwing literally everything they have at him, risking their own futures and credibility in the process.  This has all the earmarks of a legitimate war rather than a controlled contest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump has never been an accepted member of "the elite." At best, they've tolerated him because he's wealthy, generous, and has charisma that gives him influence.  His money and reputation come from an independent tree rather than blue-blood lineage.  He hasn't made his name through a machine, or a sponsorship, or a mentor.  There are no indications that he's been bred for this task at all and no reason to think he'd suddenly in his later years decide to go in the tank for team Elite.

             It feels like the Left is pushing harder than ever for mass islamic immigration.  The natural response is strong pushback in the form of Nationalism.  If the nationalism goes far enough, war will break out.  And I think they want another world war pretty badly.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, I think you're right that Trump is not a part of the "elite", but that doesn't mean he's not part of their plan.
            </p>
            <p>
             If we can get movement against globalization and become a little more isolationist, we should be alright.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if the drumbeats of war should sound, we're probably going to be in trouble.

            MSM stopped playing them because they had absolutely no effect. Trump supporters don't care. They could play video of him strangling kittens and it wouldn't cost him a single vote.

            negativity fans the flames of "divide and conquer", it's a trick, but perhaps not as you are framing it.

            the more people argue over black &amp; white (duality metaphor) issues, the less likely we'll have peace and prosperity for all who wish to participate in something more reasonable than endless wars and hate.

            What negative Clinton press? Go listen to NPR, watch cable news, and read news papers. The emails are described as embarrassing. The contents and that they can be found on Wikileaks.org are never mentioned. All you'll hear is talking points about how Trump is conspiring with the Russians.

              The DNC propaganda is aimed at old people that don't use the internet. These are the people that vote in the highest numbers.

            Nah it's too convincing. I don't think he is that clever to be able to pull that off. Plus some of the things he says are damaging to him, so if it was planned wouldn't he be saying other non damaging shit?

             Maybe he was never intended to run for that long, so someone who couldnâ€™t do an entire campaign again due to frailty or literally collapsing at events can just step in at the last moment as a hero.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, maybe this is a great way to get out of prosecution for touching children.

              I think they WANT TRUMP TO WIN.. so they're playing Joe against him to even further guarantee that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then they fire up their base even further to bring their civil war to the surface, and eventually roll it into a revolution.
             </p>
             <p>
              BLM is ran by marxists.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some governors have stockpiles of weapons they're preparing for all out war. They don't WANT to win anymore because they know they can't.. so they're not even trying to anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              All the stuff happening is being done on purpose to achieve an end goal.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not just random.. it's a plan playing out.
             </p>
             <p>
              They have a civil war and even a revolution planned.
             </p>
             <p>
              They have the guns and ammo stashed and ready.
             </p>
             <p>
              BLM the organization is ran by marxists, the leaders admit this.
             </p>
             <p>
              The governor's in some states and some of the politicians are on board to make the country socialist.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Marxist plan is to have the lowest class take over the government as dictators as first and then dismantle the government and make it socialist.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now one problem with this plan is the dumb politicians (Joe Biden) put most of the lower class men into prison for stupid crimes.
             </p>
             <p>
              So they know if they let the guys out of prison they have a larger army.
             </p>
             <p>
              Covid, as well as the BLM propaganda works to prepare the people for the civil war.
             </p>
             <p>
              They agitate the people and have them take sides in preparation for this war.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would they need to release thousands of prisoners from prison to protect them from covid when they are blasting to the regular population that masks keep you safe, and already prison is quarantine, and they can test prisoners daily if they want?
             </p>
             <p>
              Because it's not about a virus it's about a war.
             </p>
             <p>
              If trump wins again which he will, then they know they have lost the game politically and they enter true panic mode.
             </p>
             <p>
              And get this, they WANT trump to win this time, because they know that will rile up the left to FEED the civil war, it's no mistake that Joe is not hiding his mush brain, he might even be pretending to be worse than he really is to push a trump victory.. to manipulate the left..
             </p>
             <p>
              They will be passing out fully automatic weapons to the crazy antifa, BLM marxists, and criminals they are releasing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those people will start a race war/civil war.
             </p>
             <p>
              China will step in and use EMP weapons to attack the functionality of the states Throwing things into disarray.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once things are significantly chaotic, China will come from the south with ground support, and try to assist/interfere....
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah, I sure hope that ONE PERSON standing in their way can stop their plan before it gets to that point. DONALD TRUMP.
             </p>
             <p>
              otherwise they will take over the government, become dictators, dismantle the government, and if we're lucky transition from dictator to a more socialist/anarchist state, because even that would be better than them staying on as dictators.

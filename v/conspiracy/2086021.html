            Demand driven problem.
            <br/>
            Information is readily available.
            <br/>
            Most people already know what to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Way I see it:
            <br/>
            People don't want to be "healthy" because it takes effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most doctors and medical professionals do care about other people's health. 
Politicians and corporate leadership only care about profits and these are the people who can help push big trends.
           </p>
           <p>
            And here we are..
            <br/>
            Small minority who eat, exercise and live with few health problems.
            <br/>
            Rest get sick and rely on health care to keep them alive/healthy.
           </p>

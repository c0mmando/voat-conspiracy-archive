            Do you know what I've always wondered? Why was the Ayatollah Khomeini allowed to stay in England while he was plotting the overthrow of the Shah of Iran? That had to be with the collusion and permission of the CIA and the US government, as well as British authorities. They helped that crazy Muslim fanatic take down a moderate, Westernized leader of Iran. Why would they do that? Did the Shah stop playing ball with the CIA? Or did Israel step in and cause it in order to destabalize the Middle East?

             Mr. Siiiox'.s. They were Hebrews, apostate Jews. I do not want to say anything against the Jews, as such. I am not in sympathy with the anti-Semitic movement, never have been, and do not ever expect to be. I am against it. I abhor all pogroms of whatever kind. But I have a firm conviction that this thing is Yiddish, and that one of its bases is found in the

             during that summer, did he not?
            </p>
            <p>

             Senator Nelson. The Yiddish language is distinct from the He- brew?
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Simons. It is German. It is a mistum compositum.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Nelson. It is a mixture of Hebrew and German, is it not?
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. SiMONSif There are some Slavic terms, some Russian, and somB Polish iii it, and it may have some English, too. The Yiddish that is spoken on the East Side of New York has ever so much of the Eng- lish in it, and the Yiddish that is spoken in Petrograd, Moscow, War- saw, and Odessa, would have quite a lot of Russian in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Overman. This institute was the nest, the beginning, of this government, was it not? That was where it started, was it not?
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Simons. Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Wolcott. You have made one statement here which to me is very interesting, largely because it may be intensely significant. Some time back in your testimony you said that it was your con- tention that if it were not for these elements that had come from the East Side of New York City, the Bolsheviki movement would have been a failure. That to me is very interesting, because if it is true it is very significant. There are many people in this country, I think — I am sure there are many people— ^who rather look upon this Bolsheviki movement as just a passing fad, and of no deep signifi- cance ; but, of course, if the success of this monstrous thing m Russia is due to the men who came out of New York City, then this country has not anything to deal with that is trifling, at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, because of the very significance of that, can you tell us any- thing in the way of detail that leads you to the conviction that the presence of these East Side people in Russia contributed to the suc- cess of the Bolsheviki movement ?*
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Simons. The latest startling information, given me by some one who says that there is good authority for it — and I ani to be given the exact figures later on and have them checked up properly by the proper authorities — is this, that in December, 1918. in the northern community of Petrograd, so-called — that is what they call that section of the Soviet regime under the presidency of the man known as Mr. Apfelbaum — out of 388 members, only 16 happened to

             <strong>
              <strong>
               and all the rest Jews, with the exception possibly of one man, who is a negro from America, who calls himself Prof. Gordon, and 265 of the members of this northern commune govern- ment, that is sitting in the old Smolny Institute, came from the lower East Side of New York
              </strong>
             </strong>
             — 265 of them. If that is true, and they are going to check it up for me — certain Eussians in New York who have been there and investigated the facts — I think that that fits into what you are driving at. In fact, I am very much impressed with this, that moving around here I find that certain Bolsheviki propagandists are nearly all Jews — apostate Jews. I have been in the so-called People's House, at 7 East Fifteenth Street, New York, which calls itself also the Rand School of Social Science, and I have visited that at least six times during the last eleven weeks or so, buying their literature, and some of the most seditious stuff I have ever found against our own Government, and 19 out of every 20 people I have seen there ha^e been Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             And as I move around to give my lectures, usually I am pursued by Bolsheviki propagandists, and in one big church in New York I was interrupted, on the east side of the church — it so happened that they were sitting on the east side of the church — by two Bolsheviki agita- tors.

             <p>
              At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963 Australian radio played a tape recording of the JFK assassination, wherein Mrs Kennedy's voice was clearly heard calling "hello Coretta" followed by a volley of gunfire.
             </p>
             <p>
              The presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King, he played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.
             </p>
             <p>
              That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime, until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where after some short time later Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire, while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although he was feted and fabulized by the same Jew press that refused the evidence that located him with the shooters, that propounded the Lee Harvey Oswald / lone assassin scenario, there was no money the black ---- was broke .. he went to the source that had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place, read George HW Bush and asked for dough to be told there was none.
             </p>
             <p>
              So he chanced his arm at blackmail, presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas, he laughed him off, so Luther King took time out at the 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his own involvement, and was shot down for it.

             The LK's had accepted Mrs Kennedy's gracious invitation to dine with her &amp; the President in her home at the White House a short time before, which I say demonstrates the folly of treating blacks like human beings, as well it remains the genesis for the warning all blacks get, to be no closer than one rifle shot to me and my household at any time.

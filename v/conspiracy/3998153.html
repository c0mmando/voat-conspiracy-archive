             I have not. I am currently down the rabbit hole following Babylonian mysticism established by Nimrod and Samiramus, which completely inverted everything in the Bible. I happen to think that Samiramus, Catholics Mother Mary, and Jezebel are later reincarnations
             <em>
              or
             </em>
             possessions of Lilith. After the followers were scattered, they took pieces of the mysticism which contained astrology among other things, and created off shoots of all other religions, including Catholicism and Muslim. All pagan religions derive from them having used various fallen angels as lesser gods, Catholics turned them into saints.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mohammed had a vision in a cave of a being telling him to read a tablet, and when he told the being he was illiterate the being touched him and caused so much pain he thought he would die. He survived and went home to tell his wife who consulted with her friend who was devout Roman Catholic, which the founder Loyola had similar experience. She told her that he must be a prophet. He fell into a deep depression just like Loyola did. He tried killing himself by throwing himself off the mountain and saw another demonic being. This is the foundation of Muslim religion as I understood from my studies.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you think it's worth looking into ISIS unveiled, which Isis the goddess is an iteration of Lilith/Samiramus, I will.

              Much of what is on the internet is the modern manifestation of Mystery Babylon trying to convince you of the evilness of the Catholic church. Protestantism is the reason America is the Freemasonic stronghold that it is. Modernity is the cause of the moral decay. What you have written here is the typical thing Protestants and Freemasonic truths say. They are hoping you will throw the baby out with the bath water.

             <p>
              Helena Blavatsky and her theosophic peers sought to infiltrate the Jesuits and destroy the Catholic church from within. Infiltration instead of invasion. Much of what people see from the outside is the physical manifestation of Satan taking over the church via Qabballah and Freemasonry. A lot of the information is just repeated ad naseum on the truth channels about Babylon et al.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recommend Schism206 for a counter view on the Jesuits and the typical conspiracies that surround them. I think you'll really like the channel but here are two specific episodes that are relevant:

                Of course, my pleasure. This is deeply fascinating to me and I just want to figure it out. I have spent sooooo many hours in vain trying to understand the confusion of bullshit (which is what they want, I know I know). 90% of truther channels are run by Protestants who may as well be pushing gnosticism and Freemasonry and therefore Qaballah, because as you have noticed, there are common threads throughout history that tie these ideologies together. I highly recommend not throwing the baby out with the bath water and give that channel a shot. I am not a Catholic. I was raised Protestant and recently figured out I was fed some bullshit. I've been on the hunt for information since. I hope you kind find some benefit from these videos!

                 Thank you. I've been watching Know Your Enemy series by thefuelproject on YouTube. It has been absolutely enlightening. I'm only on part 41. He doesn't seem to be what you refer to so you may enjoy it as well. He is very clear that all those you mention area from Babylonian/satanic origin.  If you watch it let me know what you think. I will be watching your series when I finish his.

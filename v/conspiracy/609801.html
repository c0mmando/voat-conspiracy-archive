A paper from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has been withdrawn after pressure from at least one country. The document, which was leaked, recommends that UN members consider &quot;decriminalising drug and possession for personal consumption&quot;. It argued &quot;arrest and incarceration are disproportionate measures&quot;.</p>
<p>The document was drawn up by Dr Monica Beg, chief of the HIV/AIDs section of the UNODC in Vienna. It was prepared for an international harm reduction conference currently being held in Kuala Lumpur. The UNODC oversees international drugs conventions and offers guidance on compliance. Sources within the UNODC have told the BBC the document was never sanctioned by the organisation as policy. One senior figure within the agency described Dr Beg as &quot;a middle-ranking official&quot; who was offering a professional viewpoint. The document, on headed agency notepaper, claims it &quot;clarifies the position of UNODC to inform country responses to promote a health and human-rights approach to drug policy&quot;. &quot;Treating drug use for non-medical purposes and possession for personal consumption as criminal offences has contributed to public health problems and induced negative consequences for safety, security, and human rights,&quot; the document states.

<p>Last year almost 36,000 people were prosecuted for drug possession in England and Wales with 1,194 receiving custodial sentences.

Other UN agencies including the World Health Organisation and UNAIDS have been explicit in their opposition to drug users facing criminal sanctions on health and human rights grounds.

The lobby group Transform said today that the unpublished briefing paper was &quot;a devastating critique of the harms caused by criminalisation&quot;. &quot;The UN agency in charge of the global drug war says criminalising drug use is unnecessary, disproportionate, causes ill health, violence and death, and breaks international obligations towards health and human rights as a result,&quot; Transform\'s Danny Kushlick said today.</p>

Sources within the UNODC suggest that there would need to be wide consultation and agreement before the paper\'s recommendations became formal policy ( via bbc.com ).</p>',

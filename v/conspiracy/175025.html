            it's part of a larger project to get the French onboard with the rest of the west power structure.  The French are historically a thorn in the side of the anglo-saxon alliance and big efforts have gone into changing that over the past ten years.  Making "terrorism" something that feels local to them and shows up on their daily news is a big part of the program.

            Tunisia is a french-speaking country and events there are big news in France.  Kuwait's inclusion in this would be designed to tie-in the "middle eastern terrorist" angle more thoroughly.  Tunisians aren't arabs and neither are must Muslims in France so you need to go to the source to get them to draw that mental connection (unlike with Americans who think they're all the same).

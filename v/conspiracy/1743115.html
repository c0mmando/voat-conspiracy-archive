<p><strong>Maddox Adoption</strong></p>
<p>At the time of Maddox\'s adoption, the US had imposed tougher restrictions on adopting children from Cambodia due to trafficking fears. In 2003, Angelina Jolie adopts her first child Maddox while still married to Billy Bob. In this article she says : Jolie insisted she went to \'great lengths to ensure Maddox did not have a living birth-mother in Cambodia\' and that she would \'never rob a mother of her child.\' In March 2017 A man come forward and says that she used fake info on the adoption to push it through <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4329138/Angelina-Jolie-adopted-son-fake-papers.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4329138/Angelina-Jolie-adopted-son-fake-papers.html</a> 2017</p>
<p>The article also mention that the woman who was the adoption agent for her case was later arrested for falsifying information on adoptions. After the adoption : the ins suspended adoptions from Cambodia because of fraud and baby stealing happening in that country. Maddox’s adoption was brokered by a crooked agent who was later jailed in the U.S. for visa fraud and money laundering involving more than 800 adoptions. Many of the orphans parents were still alive also. Children’s rights groups investigating Galindo said they believed Maddox’s destitute mother sold her son for $100. <a href="http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2016/11/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-fight-keep-adopted-sons-pax-jolie-pitt-maddox-jolie-pitt/">http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2016/11/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-fight-keep-adopted-sons-pax-jolie-pitt-maddox-jolie-pitt/</a></p>
<p><strong>Zahara Adoption</strong></p>
<p>Jolie adopted Ethiopian-born Zahara in 2005. At the time of her adoption, everyone thought her biological mother, Mentewab Dawit Lebiso, had passed away. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-496176/Why-did-adoption-agency-tell-Angelina-Jolie-I-died-AIDS-gave-baby.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-496176/Why-did-adoption-agency-tell-Angelina-Jolie-I-died-AIDS-gave-baby.html</a></p>
<p>Two years later, in 2007, Lebiso came forward to say she was actually alive. It was too late to get her child back as the adoption was &quot;legal and irrevocable.&quot; Has been trying for years to be able to just talk to her daughter on the phone and has also said jolie was a good mom to her daughter and does not want to take her back. Just to get to know her. Angelina has never even acknowledged her publicly or commented on it. Pretty funny considering she has previously stated : and that she would \'never rob a mother of her child.\' And again information had been falsified on documents. <a href="https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/01/17/mother-of-angelina-jolies-adopted-child-zahara-begs-to-see-da/21656935/">https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/01/17/mother-of-angelina-jolies-adopted-child-zahara-begs-to-see-da/21656935/</a></p>
<p><strong>Pax Adoption</strong></p>
<p>Pax, who had the birth name Pham Quang Sang, was born to Pham Thu Dung, according to IMDb. It is alleged there that Thu Dung was a heroin addict who fled the hospital after Pax’s birth. Pax reportedly had a liver problem which led to a higher hospital bill than Thu Dung could afford. The bill was for £15.
Pax Jolie-Pitt’s birth mother, Pham Thu Dung, was not dead, but only in prison. She will soon be released and possibly wants her son returned to her. <a href="http://thedailymillbury.com/celebrity-news/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-pax-and-maddoxs-international-adoption-problems/55930">http://thedailymillbury.com/celebrity-news/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-pax-and-maddoxs-international-adoption-problems/55930</a></p>

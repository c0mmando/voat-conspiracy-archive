            fuck israel, the terrorists that founded it were no better than the nazi's they fled and have done nothing but repeat the same atrocities against another race of people.

            who brought nukes in to the middle east first? israel
who assasinated their neighbors political and science leaders? israel
who attacks their "allies" and gets away with it? israel
who threatens every single country around them with war and bombing, yet claims they are defending themseleves? israel

            I believe that we are overlooking an important issue here. The Nuclear nonproliferation treaty. Iran signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation treaty. It clearly states that all nations have the right to develop nuclear energy (Iran's stated desire), however it states that any development of nuclear weapons would be a clear violation of the treaty. Israel has not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and so are free to develop as many nuclear weapons as they like. It is not about whether or not this is right, or fair, or what things should be like, but rather about what is the currently standing international law.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons">
             Here
            </a>
            is a list of who has and has not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This post is misleading by attempting to compare Israel's nuclear program with Iran's. Israel did it legally, but Iran, with it's current standing in regards to the treaty, would be breaking international law.

             That's actually not true.  Israel repeatedly violated U.S. law in pursuit of materials and equipment.  Furthermore, Israel deceived the U.S. on numerous occasions, assuring the Kennedy administration in one case that no weapons development was going on while clandestinely working to do just that in their Dimona facility.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moreover, failure to sign the NNPT (which puts it in league with North Korea, BTW) does not confer unto Israel the right to violate international law and attack the nuclear facilities of member NNPT states, as it did in the case of both Iraq and Iran, nor does it confer unto Israel the right to violate international law in the case of their assault on Syria's alleged nuclear facility.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's quite telling that in every instance of some nations nuclear facilities being attacked, Israel is always involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             And in so doing, they've worked to legitimize this as an acceptable tactic in warfare.  Why should any of the Arab states feel constrained when the time comes to put Dimona in their crosshairs?
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything about the way Israel uses its nuclear weapons -- alone in the world as having no enemy similarly equipped -- is appalling, indefensible and ultimately, self-defeating, and the day when the very Jewish news media can routinely give cover to these monsters is fast coming to a close.

              Thank you. In this thread there have been 3 people who keep acting as though because they didn't sign the NNPT, they're just free to do as they wish. International law means nothing if countries can just opt-out of it.

             What about the UN deciding Israel is committing war crimes and the UN and calling for Israel to leave Palestine? Why doesn't Israel worry about complying with international law in this case?
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's be real, it has nothing to do with international law, it has to do with power games. And Israel is in the power seat right now so they feel as if they have the ability to push Iran around. That's all it is.

            The "Iranian peace deal" is just a setup. It's impossibly strict and being forced on Iran, and when Iran inevitably violates one of the rules, the US/Israel will go "See? They can't even act in good faith, they ruined this peace treaty!" and that will give justification in the eyes of the public, through the media, that Iran is worthy of being attacked because they can't even honor a simple peace treaty.
           </p>
           <p>
            How can they let Iran have nukes when they've threatened to attack Israel?
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the story that will be sold to us over the coming months. Don't buy it.  They want you to ignore the other side of the story, that Israel has hundreds of nukes, and
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7RuaHDOcdU">
             threatens Iran constantly.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            That'll sway the crucial 20-40% of the public's opinion needed to support an actual physical war against Iran, which is what Israel wants because Iran is the only other developed country in that region and Israel doesn't like competition.

             The news led Ben-Gurion to make the only statement by an Israeli Prime Minister about Dimona. On December 21 he announced to the Knesset that the government was building a 24 megawatt reactor "which will serve the needs of industry, agriculture, health, and science", and that it "is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes". Bergmann, who was chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1966, however said that "There is no distinction between nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or warlike ones"

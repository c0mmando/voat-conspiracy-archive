        <div class="usertext-body may-blank-within" id="commentContent-2878553">

            <li>
             <p>
              The black box recording has not been released. I could swear I said this before. :)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              From the video: "The calculated area from which the missile was launched measures about 320 square kilometers and is situated in the eastern part of Ukraine. Further forensic research is required to determine the launch location.
              <strong>
               Such work falls outside the mandate
              </strong>
              of the Dutch Safety Board." So, your second point was flat wrong. After watching the entire video, I would like to add two more points...
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              From the video: "Traces of explosives were found in the wreckage and on the missile fragments found. Paint on the fragments found inside the wreckage matches paint on the recorvered missile parts. The point of detonation was determined by the spray pattern on the cockpit and by simulations and was confirmed by the recorded sound peak. The impact and the blast resulted in the aeroplane's disintegration. The wreckage of the aeroplane was distributed over six different sites, consistent with the way the aeroplane broke up in the air. Based on these findings, the Dutch Safety Board concludes that Flight MH17 was downed by a 9N314M warhead carried on a 9M38 series missile as installed on a Buck surface-to-air missile system." That's it? The paint? That's not working for me.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              From the video: "But none of the parties involved made any connection between the military developments and the possible risks posed to civil aviation... Ukraine had sufficient to close the airspace to civilian aviation prior to July 17." Where have I heard this nobody-could-know stuff before?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Thanks for the video. Despite multiple times it claims that "the findings are conclusive," it simply does not make the case. Twenty minutes full of fancy work and propaganda and still not enough to make the case. While you are trying to debunk the article here, and while you make some decent points about the article the bottom line is this:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The official report did not prove the case.
            </strong>

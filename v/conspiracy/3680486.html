<p>Heat is defined as the vibration or movement of molecules within matter. The faster the molecular motion the higher the temperature. The slower the molecular motion the colder the temperature.

<p>A vacuum is a condition of nothingness where there are no molecules. Vacuums exist in degrees. Some scientists tell us that there is no such thing as an absolute vacuum. Space is the closest thing to an absolute vacuum that is known to us. There are so few molecules present in most areas of what we know as &quot;space&quot; that any concept of &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; is impossible to measure. A vacuum is a perfect insulator. That is why a &quot;Thermos&quot; or vacuum bottle is used to store hot or cold liquids in order to maintain the temperature for the longest time possible without re-heating or re-cooling.</p>',

           <p>
            Okay if society is going to move forward, we need more people to understand the actual truth about medical science.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the first truth is - our entire western medical system is based on lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Viruses, bacteria, germs, etc, are NEVER the cause of any disease EVER.
           </p>
           <p>
            All those things do are consume dead parts of cells through various mechanisms.
           </p>
           <p>
            To say viruses and bacteria cause disease would be like saying firefighters are the ones who caused the fire. Or janitors are the ones who made the toilets shitty. No, they are there to clean up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bacteria are the janitors of the body. Notice how bacteria doesn't consume our flesh until we're dead? Yeah that's because they only eat DEAD cells or dead parts of cells.
           </p>
           <p>
            Viruses are solvents our body makes (think soap like goo) that are produced by our cells, to dissolve specific parts of cells that are too toxic for the body to deal with otherwise (bacteria being first line of defense).
           </p>
           <p>
            So when someone says "they died of the flu" That means their body was so toxic that the body was releasing many different types of viruses to clean out those cells. Sometimes as a cell is too toxic, the entire cell will be destroyed as a final effort to get that stuff out.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have 100,000 new toxins/chemicals  added to our environment in the last 100 years. This shit is in:
           </p>
           <p>
            Your socks and underwear (little fibers and material we absorb through skin)
           </p>
           <p>
            In dish soap
           </p>
           <p>
            Cleaning products (the real cause of disease NOT the bacteria they supposedly clean up!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Chemicals in the air
           </p>
           <p>
            Fluoride in water, other chemicals in water
           </p>
           <p>
            Eating too much cooked food (food creates toxins every time you cook, many carcinogenic)
           </p>
           <p>
            How to fix this?
           </p>
           <h1 id="md-thing-you-need-to-get-in-your-diet---raw-unpasteurized-dairy-products-order-them-online-as-the-elites-have-made-them-illegal-in-many-states-simply-because-they-are-some-of-the-only-truly-healing-foods-on-the-planet.-eat-lots-of-raw-eggs-too.-cooking-them-destroys-them.">
            1 thing you need to get in your diet - raw unpasteurized dairy products (order them online, as the elites have made them illegal in many states, simply because they are some of the only truly healing foods on the planet). Eat lots of raw eggs too. Cooking them destroys them.
           </h1>
           <p>
            Start eating raw meat. There are strains of bacteria in raw meat you need. The lie is that you will get sick from it. Nope. You only get sick from UNDERCOOKED meat because remember bacteria thrive on dead cells right? So when you undercook it, you give the bacteria a chance to grow on all the dead cells you just created. This is why leaving cooked food out overnight can be the worst. Versus when I leave raw meat out on my counter for a day or two, its perfectly fine. Absolutely no issues even digests better after the natural bacteria has a chance to proliferate. Same with the raw milk. If you leave it out in a cupboard, it will turn into a natural kefir. All raw foods, never go bad. They just get predigested by the bacteria and enzymes naturally in them. This is how people lived for 1000's of years without refrigeration. Leaving the foods out. And they're actually healthier for you and more easily digested after they've fermented. Cooked food is how people get "sick" but in reality that bacteria is causing a detox that is too fast for your body, but thats another level of knowledge. However, raw meat will have bacteria in the right strains quantity and quality for your body. Raw meat is way way way better for you than cooked. It is night and day in how you feel. Cooked meat will make you feel bloated and like you have to take a shit. Raw meat makes your energy go straight up and absolutely no digestion issues. I don't even fart hardly at all anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Get a cheap shower water filter. Even $15 ones will keep most of the crap out of your body.
           </p>
           <p>
            Drink only spring water or from a natural water source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do earthing everyday, this will help detox you too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Swim in natural water sources from time to time. There are bacteria strains there you wont get anywhere else.
           </p>
           <p>
            Read and listen to everything on Aajonus Vonderplanitz. He was a gift to this earth and healed over 30,000 people from stage 4 cancer, reversed diabetes, cured asthma, etc you name it he cured it. And his cancer patients had a 98.5% success rate with no return of cancers. Ever. This is so long as they kept eating the raw meat, raw eggs, raw dairy and stayed away from shitty cooked food that kills us and robs us of digestive enzymes every time we eat a cooked food meal.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is night and day in how you feel, should you start doing these things. You will feel like a new species and the neural matter in your brain (which should be made from uncooked omega-3 fatty acids) will grow properly giving you a higher IQ and better mental performance. Also my athletic performance is better than it ever has been. This has been my experience anyways, and many other people who follow these protocols.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, just letting you guys know the truth about food and how to heal yourselves. The raw unpasteurized dairy has been outlawed in many states, simply because the elites knew it was a healing food and outlawed it after WWII. You can buy into herdshares in those states through. Look it up on the weston a price foundation.
           </p>

             absolutely not true. A lie told to you by the rockerfeller institute and you dont even knwo it. You need to watch that footage and there is much more. Unless youre a big headed douche who is doing everything I just wrote in that post, youre not that healthy and you dont know shit about health.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tell me what are the top things you do for your health. I bet its nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             No tacit knowledge. Just things youve heard places and cant back them up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again lies. youve been lied to. thats why I made this post. Dont be an idiot and miss out on upgrading you knowledge base. Thats foolish and selfish.

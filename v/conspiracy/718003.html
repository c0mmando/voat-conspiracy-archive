            what kills me is that the doctors prescribe things,  but YOU HAVE TO TAKE THEM.
           </p>
           <p>
            meaning,  its still a choice the consumer of the drugs have to make,  and to be perfectly honest,  these parents throwing a drug in their infant that they didn't research is borderline child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            they should have used Charlotte's web oil.  It changed a little girls seizures from. 10-15 per day,  to one big one a month.  CBD oil is the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            that was my thought anyways until I read the parents were american.  Makes sense now.  Fucking dumb americans strike again

             OK EuroFag, settle down.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have to understand if you can, from under your blanket of disarmed, dependent on the state security, and amazing socialism (hows your paycheck?) that these "dumb-fuck Americans" are literally threatened with having their children taken away forcibly by the very government supposed to protect them if they refuse Dr's orders. Do you understand?
            </p>
            <p>
             If I take my child to the Dr and they prescribe something I don't agree with and decide that "No, they're not going to take this shit" the Dr can call social services and have the children removed, without court order (typically), and then placed in foster care only to be drugged and statistically sexually assaulted?
            </p>
            <p>
             Dumb Americans, indeed you fuck-wit.

              You are dumb.
             </p>
             <p>
              First off - I'm in Canada.
             </p>
             <p>
              second off - you're telling me that if your doctor prescribed anti add medication and I dont give it to my child and decide to,  instead exercise the kid,  that I could get my child taken away?
             </p>
             <p>
              you know why you're dumb americans?  because A you let it happen,  and B you still live there.
             </p>
             <p>
              my paychecks are fine,  as well.  I had a pretty extensive reconstruction done on one of my joints earlier this year by a VERY well known doctor.  It cost me ZERO DOLLAR.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm murrica,  doctors are paid more by the hosptials to extend your stay,  did you know that?  They don't care about you.  if you get mrsa?  oh too bad muffin. youre going to have to stay here for a lil while longer.  Oh there are complications that could have been avoided?  sorry sugar,  the hosptials bottom line is suffering,  you're gonna need to stay.  and don't get me started on your ridiculous fucking deductibles on your obamacare.
             </p>
             <p>
              Capitalism should stay out of healthcare,  and education.  Everything else is fair game.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before I used to defend the average american,  but i see now that y'all love to be ignorant.  Look at your politicians,  they are reflective of your society. North Carolina is afraid of solar because it'll suck the energy from the sun,  and I'm pretty sure there are other states that worry if windmills will use up all the wind.
             </p>
             <p>
              the war on intellectualism has gone on for too long - no child left behind is a farce.  America has falling grades,  is constantly lowering the bar (a "C"  is now 50% in california wtf).
             </p>
             <p>
              you all suck because you drink the koolaid, let apathy get to you,  and you vote in the most retarded candidates in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              you aren't idiots for lack of brains,  y'all are too scared to use them.

               Ok CanadaFag. So I got my commonwealth wrong - so what? I guess you were absent of the koo-aid party when you all put Harper (neo con like Bush) into power? Nah, just a fluke.

               Yes, that's exactly what I'm fucking telling you. Can't you read my comment or is it censored already? The rest of your commentary seems to attempt to sell me something I already bought quite a while ago. I know this system is absolute shit. Does that make it better? Nope.

               And if you think the government is actually representational of the average American, you've been watching too much Canuck TV. This is a goddamned oligarchy - if you're not in the top 10%, you don't really matter to anyone. Is that the average Americans fault? Maybe - but when the rest of the world is simultaneously calling you stupid for not using your weapons against your government and stupid for having weapons you think would work against your government, what then?

               Agreed. And now we have to look forward to the University PC police and their 'safe space for anyone not white and male' modus operandi taking over society. That's going to be fun!

              <p>
               Cherry pick your American examples that we, other Americans, also poke fun at and call it representational of all America if it lets you feel better about your shitty government and allows you to sleep better at night. I could care less. But at least know you're absolutely part of the problem and 100% wrong.

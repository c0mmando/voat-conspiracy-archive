<p>LETTER TO THE EDITOR. Emma Karlsson reflects on hormone disruption and &quot;gender corrections.&quot; Is today\'s society unnatural one reason why some people get sexual disorders?</p>
<p>Ahead of the upcoming Pride I thought I\'d share with you a theory I have about so-called &quot;born in the wrong sex&quot; phenomenon that has received much attention recently. Everywhere you can read about all the young people who claim to be &quot;born in the wrong body&quot;, what is that? Is it really just a product of social propaganda? Did their parents or preschool from the first hours struck in them doubt their sex or is there something more?</p>
<p>I intend to highlight a certain rather controversial view on the subject. What if the cause is actually something more and more people are actually &quot;born in the wrong sex&quot;? That people due to hormonal disturbances already in fetal life gets a little confused. Think about all the years of biological warfare has worked and all of these endocrine disruptors, we have around us still have started to break down nature so that there is something wrong in the womb?</p>
<p>I actually think that one can be born the wrong sex. I think it is possible. However, I do not believe that it is natural or positive but the result of several years of endocrine disruptors in clothing, diet, hygiene, etc. That along with the diseased propaganda offensive that puts the question in the minds of vulnerable children should obviously contribute more and more people believe they were born the wrong sex or belong to LGBTQ although perhaps even genetically do not have the disorder.</p>
<p>There are reports that the synthetic estrogen used in among other things, the [birth control] pill is not possible to filter out of our water. All women worldwide who take the pill pee out artificial hormonal substances that go straight into our waterways and into our drinking water. It means that every day, from the moment the egg is fertilized get in your hormonal disorder topics which then continues every day for the rest of your life. It claims indeed from the &quot;noble&quot; pharmaceutical industry and our everything so well meaning government that the levels are so low that it does not affect humans. But I do not feel quite as confident. Is it so very far away to imagine that if it affects the animal can not see it then, after a few generations putting tracks also in humans?</p>
<p>There are reports of female polar bears with masculine traits, fish and amphibians in the Baltic Sea that are both sterile and hermaphrodite. Reports from England show that men have a female breast tissue. The decreasing sperm number of Danish men are also believed to be linked to synthetic hormones in the water. Is it far-fetched to draw a connection between these facts, effects on the animal world and the LGBT deviations? Is not it rather perfectly reasonable to draw a connection between them and assume that there are people who are genetically gays, lesbians, trannies and even born in the wrong body because prolonged exposure to endocrine disruptors? As well, it should not be totally wrong to consider that it is a disease and not something to encourage our children to.</p>
<p>As I already explained, I believe that a small amount of people actually suffer from this disorder. But far from everyone involved in the LGBT movement has actually doing there. It\'s probably more of humans\' natural pack instincts which belong to making and accepting the group is among the most important thing. To then end up and be accepted in the LGBTQ flock feels certainly good and safe for most people, it is totally socially accepted. You can not be questioned by anyone when everything usually counts as hate speech. Only it\'s crazy. How can a genetic abnormality become a separate ethnic group?</p>
<p>But how should we deal with this discrepancy, then? Yes, it\'s good that they actually have been born with this different degrees of genetic abnormalities may help, but whether gender correction is the right approach, where I am a little ambivalent. On the one hand, if there is a genetic fault affected by external factors, should they not be helped to &quot;fix it&quot;? On the other hand, I am against us tampering with nature and playing god. But if we are from the beginning the ones that has disturbed nature, should we not fix it again?</p>
<p>I can imagine that people actually have different types of this deviation is feeling very bad and needs the help of the community in some way. The people where the interference is so deep that it might be born in the wrong sex feeling probably the worst. But is it right to &quot;change back&quot;, or should you stick to the psychologist? Since I do not know exactly how it works, if these people can have children, and so. I think it depends on how far they go in their &quot;correction&quot; but the question is whether they will be allowed for them to reproduce at all? They have obviously a genetic abnormality that should not be spread further if it is to stop.</p>
<p>This knowledge justifies obviously not LGBTQ movement sick rampage. To raise up something then they should be classified as a genetic damage or deviation as normal, positive and good is just insane. How can it be illegal or inappropriate to show porn to children if it is considered appropriate to take them to the Pride, where almost every adult goes around and look as if they are taken directly from a sex scene? How can it be illegal to expose themselves to both children and adults if it is allowed during Pride? What is the difference?</p>
<p>Pride has become something of a &quot;festival&quot; where everything is happy and positive where the world is covered with pink clouds and everyone is happy. It has become a symbol of love, togetherness and happiness. Where diseases and genetic abnormalities praised and considered to be the new normal. It\'s a shame. Because I think we would need a real festival every year with bright colors and zany antics. But the core of this festival will be paying tribute to a genetic abnormality and show what can be compared with the porn of innocent kids are crazy. We need a new festival, where health is at the core instead of pornographic and downright illegal scenes in public.</p>',

            Its a really difficult transition to make. That's a big part of the reason I was on a fixed diet. I had to find foods that I could get in plastic, and in non-plastic. I relied pretty heavily on farmers market produce, and a local woman that uses mason jars to preserve food she grows among her friends. Meat was nearly impossible to find outside of plastic containers, so I got most of my protein from eggs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I felt so much better after those three weeks that I have largely stuck with fresh produce. I've always leaned towards a vegetarian diet (out of frugality more than anything), but fresh food in particular is worth the potential price bump. Fresh fruits and veggies are also about the only foods that more or less universally get packaged in paper products. Plus they taste better when they haven't been frozen, for whatever reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you ever give this a try, I'd be really interested to know how it turned out for you. I'm the only person I personally know that's tried it, and I wouldn't mind some more input on my theory!

            I'm pretty certain at this point that its plastics. Plenty of studies have been done showing that plastics are estrogenic. Microwave meals and water bottles sitting in the sun are potentially the main source of the decline in masculinity we see in recent generations. The birth control hormones could definitely explain the remaining genetic aberrations.
           </p>
           <p>
            If any males want to do an experiment:
           </p>
           <p>
            -Buy yourself a glass cup, mug, picture, water bottle, bowl, and plate. I'd recommend clear glass all the way around, pyrex if possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Don't buy or eat any foods that come in plastic containers.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Keep a daily journal for six weeks detailing your sleep and energy habits, starting 3 weeks before you switch to glass.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you do the above, its not going to be any sort of publishable study, but it was enough to convince me that I'm not just imagining the results.
           </p>

            After 3 weeks, I averaged 40 minutes less sleep per night, and self reported an averaged 2 points greater energy across the fifth and sixth weeks of the test (self reported each night out of 10 points). I also lost 2 lbs by the 6th week (with weight averaged across the 6th week), compared to the 3rd week (weighed mornings after using the bathroom), while on a fixed diet across all 6 weeks. Weight significant weight change was noted only after the 4th week.

            Perhaps this is all just placebo effect, but I'm sold either way.

             I was planning on changing all my food-boxes to glass anyway because it's easier to clean and feels less cheap. Win-win!

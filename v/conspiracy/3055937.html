            Listen, they are not putting shit on the moon. What they ARE doing is sucking up billions of new sheckels by copying the same NASA space scam they pulled off here in the states . They’ll publish a few gay cgi videos and increase there budget year after year for black budget programs that don’t exist . They’ll conviently go to a portion of the moon we can’t see here from independence back yard telescope for verification. And if I’m wrong? Then we’ll all get to stare at an Israeli flag flapping the moon wind forever....

                Q gets at least a hundred questions to choose from on a Q&amp;A nite, then he chooses which questions to answer. So why pick "Did we go to the Moon" only to lie?...you don't seek the truth you seek Reassurance, I can't help you with that.

                  No reason to be deceptive about the Moon landing, none. You are dropping it in the deceptive category because it doesn't fit your narrative....It's not what i believe so there for it most be deceptive, wrong. I do know the truth  I'm not speculating, this for me is not a debate it's a fact. So please with all due respect lets agree to disagree.

             I'd agree that it's used to launder money. NASA channels about 20 billion a year, basically the same amount in adjusted dollars as the budget they had at the height of the space race. Yet the difference in output seems to be a little bit off.

             Maybe because of all those diversity hires.

            You're wrong about that. You just have to have your telescope attached to a satellite orbiting the Moon.

             Your satellite was launched in 2009 and captures at a maximum 0.5-meter resolution images. Do you think that was worth the 1/2 billion dollar investment by taxpayers? Do you think they could have made it zoom in a bit more than that?

           <p>
            I see more than one pixel in these images. Of course you can always say it's all made up and fake. In this day you're never going to get a picture that is not in digital format, so you can always use the CGI claim for everything.

            I also stumbled upon these guys from Germany, who used the Bochum observatory 20m telescope in 1972, to record the Apollo 16 TV signals directly from the moon:

           </p>
           <p>
            I guess it can be fake also. Maybe NASA bounced a signal from a secret geostationary satellite? Seems they went through an awful lot of trouble to fake it in that case. Almost as much trouble as just doing the mission in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            In time we will know for certain though, as more orbiters and more pictures will eventually show up. Sooner or later someone is going to find the moon landing sites are either empty, or we'll get some super high res photos from there, and then we can finally lay this debate to rest.

             I'd love for it to be true, if it is true the story is incredible. I'd hold a lot of resentment for the geniuses who apparently pulled it off because of their records keeping but I'd still be pretty happy about it. I just don't think it was physically possible for them to have done it, they discovered at some point their heat shield wasn't strong enough, their radiation shielding wasn't strong enough, their rocket wasn't strong enough.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were looking at a 10 year delay for those reasons alone, who knows what other problems they were running into at the same time. I think they just decided that before the existing president's term was up they would fake it and it worked.

              I see more than one pixel in these images. Of course you can always say it's all made up and fake.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I could say it is fake, but mainly because none of those pictures are independently verified. They all come from one source. I'd only add that it's a bit weird the lander is barely visible (about 8 pixels) yet you can clearly see footprints. Maybe that's possible, that footprints put big enough a dent into the soil that shadows make them visible.

            <p>
             They probably did use radio signals, I'm not suggesting they plugged the Houston command centre into a tv station. But it is very curious that since it was transmitted via radio signals that not a single copy exists of it.

             <p>
              They did record it, but this was Apollo 16 already remember. It was not the first mission any more. They recorded the video feed, and seems to have also caught some telemetry data. The problem is they used machines and formats that do not exist today any more. These guys were just enthusiasts, and they probably never assumed it was going to be important for archival purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here is a guy who was attempting to restore the tapes. As you can see it is not a simple thing, when nobody is manufacturing the esoteric recording equipment that existed almost 50 years ago any more.

              I just want to point out that radio telescopes like that are extremely directional and sensitive. So unless the signal would have been coming straight from the direction of the moon, they would have known something was wrong. So IF we assume this story is right, AND what they reported is true, then there are really only two possibilities: 1) NASA had a geostationary satellite bouncing the signal right in front of the moon, just for purposes like this, 2) The signal was really coming from the moon.

            It's fake, nobody can go to the moon. So don't worry. China didn't go there, Russia can't go there and Israel can't go there.

            As for all those 'moon rocks' the majority have been lost and the ones that have been tested turned to either be trees or rocks originating from Earth.

              Here's a question, I'd ask you, let's say before you got married you heard a rumor that your best friend banged your fiance and when you asked him if he did he answered
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               No we were just friends.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              No worries, you trust him. Then on your wedding night you discover a video of him dogging your wife on her phone and now there is clear evidence he lied to you.
             </p>

             <p>
              NASA clearly lied about the Moonlandings, the question you have to ask is why would you ever believe anything they have to say ever again? Why is NASA any different than your hypothetical best friend in my example?

               Because the reason for lying was to prevent a cold war from escalating into a hot war, and the people involved are all retired or dead now. The problem I have with the lie is it hasn't been untold yet and is hurting progress.

                You hit the nail on the head and that's exactly actually how I got into Flat Earth. If the Moon hoax was a psy-op for the Cold War all the astronoauts should be given medals because they did a great job keeping up moral. Here's the issue and the reason WHY the lie hasn't been revealed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Russia has always maintained technological supremacy in space. Even to this day they have a monopoly in space. This isn't debatable. So WHY after 60 years have the Russians who have the best space technology in the world not gone to the moon?
               </p>
               <p>
                As a small aside the American space shuttle and rocket launch is based off Soviet Union technology and rocketry.
               </p>
               <p>
                The evidence, if you start looking into it, is because Russia simply CAN'T go to the moon. Why?

                is presented as the next curiosity. Why was the mission so secret and why was a massive military sent to Antarctica? Then why is the Antarctica treaty THE ONLY international treaty that regardless of the Cold War or political hostilities is always maintained? Why is nobody allowed to go there without military permission? Why have there never been any flights over the South Pole?

                is the next natural rabbit hole. Think logically, how insane is it that the Government of the US was blasting NUCLEAR bombs into our atmosphere, why?

               <p>
                All these little rabbit holes on themselves don't look like that big of a deal, however you add in other things like, why is there no picture of earth from space that isn't CGI? Which could easily shut up the Flat Earthers and you start realizing that perhaps the reason why Russia is silent and never called out America on it's Moon landings is because after WW2 the Governments finally had the technology to properly explore this earth and they realized that

                  The gif shows the flat earth model, the sun and moon are much much smaller and only 3k miles up Hence why as the rotation shows only part of the earth is lit up at a time. The yin/yam just shows part of the earth at sunset and sunrise

                   If a light is shining on a flat surface like a spotlight would, shouldn't it create a circle of light? Why does the light create that ying yang shape, and bend around the moon all the way to the other side of the earth?

                    As for the gif, there’s a bunch of them out there, most don’t have the yin/yang like that, I posted it cause I thought it was neat obviously the light probably doesn’t bend like that.

                    Depends on where the sun and moon are in the cycles, in the summer the Sun circles closer to the North Pole and that’s why you have 24/7 day light sometimes you see the moon in the day light and sometimes you don’t. The reason the sun “sets” is due to perspective not due to it going over any curve

                 One of my big issues with the moon landing stuff is that sane people making rational plainly obvious points are completely drowned out by the crazies. If you go looking for people talking about the moon landings being fake, you'll come across it, but it's always always always people who provide the worst possible arguments, or believe there's aliens up there. Lets deal with the first issue first shall we? The moon landings being not real.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are forums that promise to be "scientists, engineers", etc. debunking the moon landing hoax. But nobody on any of those platforms are debumking the questions that I have. They're debunking low hanging fruit. So you try to create an account, you can't. When people are there posting hoax questions, it's always someone asking something basic, easily debunked, outright wrong, and the person either ends up leaving with their tail between their legs or going off into crazy land for all to see. The reason is because all of it is fake.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have seen it so many times where those perpetrating the hoax try continuously to link the moon hoax with flat earth. Because most people wouldn't accept the flat earth. It's an effort to associate the moon hoax and flat earth. Then they accuse anyone talking sense about the moon landings as being flat earthers and your post is a good example of the type of gaslighting I'm talking about.

                  Yeah, I get you on the conspiracy crazies. Luckily for me I stumbled upon the best and well researched arguments on the Moonlanding hoax [
                  <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie/">
                   here
                  </a>
                  ] I promise you that all your questions will be answered because it's basically a small book and the author takes apart every aspect of the landings, gets into history of the participants and other common sense things. He doesn't even touch the low hanging fruit at all.

                  It's not an effort, it's a by-product of it. I believed in the moon hoax for years before I even heard about the Flat Earth though I will admit that the Flat Earth is much easier to believe if you realize that the Moon Landings didn't happen. However, just because there is a close link in logic between the flat earthers and the moon hoaxers doesn't make one or the other more wrong. Simply, one group asked more questions and used the moon landing as a spring board.

                   When people are there posting hoax questions, it's always someone asking something basic, easily debunked, outright wrong, and the person either ends up leaving with their tail between their legs or going off into crazy land for all to see.

                  Another thing that you need to consider is the possibility that these people are literally paid to make Flat Earthers and Moon Landing deniers look insane. I don't know if your account is an alt or you really have only been on this site for 2 months. However, there are legit accounts and subs on here like
                  <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AnonAll">
                   v/AnonAll
                  </a>
                  that are paid to intentionally post stories day in and day out to disrupt this website. There was even a user on here several months ago that admitted they were paid to come here, gain the trust of the community and then shit post certain opinions and stories.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Moonlanding Hoax and the Flat Earth aren't anything compared to the real shit that is happening to the world right now. Just look at politics and how many people were assasinated by Hillary Clinton. No, Voat isn't that small to go un-noticed and the crazies aren't usually crazy. And no the Flat Earth movement aren't all shills, the proof of that is Youtube changing their algorythm intentionally and specifically so

                   I'm not trying to silence you, I'm saying that if we're talking about the moon landings and someone else walks in and says "flat earth" it looks like a diversion. There is no reason for flat earth to be invoked in order to debunk moon landings.

                    And as someone who has leaned towards Flat Earth after debunking the Moon Landing it makes sense to me to invoke the FE because that's where my logical perspective led me. I understand it may not be the best rhetoric for people who are struggling with conspiracies in the beginning, however, once you realize the Moon Landing didn't happen suddenly you 'just get it' and the other theories start making sense one after the other.

                     Sorry dude but there are some extremely obvious and glaring issues with the flat Earth scenario. Just like with the moon landings. I find it extremely hard to believe someone with enough logic to see through the moon landing hoax, doesn't have enough logic to see the extremely obvious everyday things that prove the earth isn't flat. Everyday things like the sunrise and sunset easily prove the flat Earth theory wrong. As with much other obvious things that are just remedial logic. It's even more obvious that the Earth is not flat than it is that the moon landings we're a hoax.

                      That’s because you’ve never looked into the FE model. It makes sense and checks out. One big thing that doesn’t make sense on a globe model is why you can see the full moon during the day. You’ve never wondered about that?

                        Even mainstream scientists admit that they can’t prove neither the geocentric nor the heliocentric models. Both of the math and science checks out in both models, we just chose to accept the heliocentric one and not the FE one.

                         Dude whatever. 🙄 That shit has nothing to do with flat Earth. And again that just basic logic.. the world doesn't revolve around the earth duh. The planets revolve around the sun. It's due to gravity man... Either way you're getting off subject. So do explain if the earth is flat why can you observe the sun sinking into the horizon? And rising out of the horizon for sunrise? And why can you not just see it get smaller while it circles around ... Which is what would happen in the flat Earth model.

                             Nope because if the earth were flat then we would see the sun circle around heck it probably would not even completely disappear. Then there's the flight patterns completely blows the lid off the theory.

                              You haven't studied this and I don't feel like you grasp the size of the earth in relation to the size of the moon and sun. Like I said the math checks out if the sun is small enough and close enough to the earth to be a 'spotlight' like you mentioned with the photo that I attached. As for Flight patters....

                               If the flat Earth model we're true then every single flight we take today, would instead of being straight from one palace to another it would be a curved line not straight. And you say I haven't studied the theory, you haven't studied basic science dude. You're talking complete crap now. We couldn't fly 😂 you have a very minimal concept of scientific principals and so flat Earth has conned you because you're just not smart enough to see through it.

                              <p>
                               So answer me this when we fly from let's say California to New York (if the earth is flat) why don't we just fly straight there? And since we fly in a curve how does the pilot make it appear that we're not banking or tilted at all? And also why doesn't the pilot just fly straight there? All pilots are in on this conspiracy? Do they mention it to then when they get their pilots license? Oh by the way the Earth's really clat so you have to fly at a curve but don't let the people know?

                                Think about this logically, if the earth was spinning 1,000mph why even fly anywhere from California to NY? All you would have to do is get in a helicopter go straight up in the air a few feet and wait till the globe spins below you and then land back down in the location you wanted. Fact is this doesn't happen, why? The Globalists give us a bunch of bullshit answers, the logic should be easy to understand though if it worked like we are told.

                                 But skip all that. What do you think why? Who put the moon. And sun up there? Why do they lie about it? Yeah those thousands of people that would have eventually realized what's going on and are now part of the cover-up, why do they do it? Where does all the energy for the sun come from? What holds it in the sky? Where did the dome come from and what's under it? And why are all the other planets round or are they all just fake? And your claim about the flight patterns makes no sense on a larger scale since planes would literally run out of gas.... And again... You refuse to answer WHY CAN WE NOT SEE THE SUN AS IT SWINGS AROUND TO COME BACK TOMORROW MORNING? ITS FLAT RIGHT? THEN WE WOULS STILL SEE THE DAMN SUN.......  FUCKING DUHHHHB

                                  Because it's too far away. Jesus how dense do you have to be. The sun circles the earth which is 25,000 miles at the equator and in the summer in the north pole you CAN see it 24/7 and you CAN see the moon in the daytime. I would know cause I lived there. So I actually have seen the sun at night.

Meaning at this point you can say whatever you want and just say because my invisible friend made it that way.. mind control much?

                                     Not true dude. Evolution is proven in so many ways, and you don't have to believe in a big bang, who said you have to claim to know anything at all that isn't proven?  How about god is illogical and religion is a form of mind control, however to claim you know it was some big bang is just buying into the opposite type of mind control. Accept that you just don't know, and only claim things that you have ample evidence to prove. There is none for a god, there is however plenty of proof of evolution which is as proven as anything else. Definitely more than religion or flat Earth theories.

                                      By Definition you have to have FAITH that something comes from nothing aka the big bang. You have to have FAITH that life was created from nothing aka Evolution. There is zero evidence that could ever happen.

                                       Bullshit. Here we go again with I have to do something. And trying to sling shit at me and make it stick.  What if the shit was always here why does there have to be a beginning? Cannot conceive it otherwise? Then invent an invisible Man in the sky and suck his cock all you want. That doesn't mean I have to believe that, OR THE OPPOSITE. What if either I choose to believe it was always there? No bang? No god? Or even more perplexing to your logic, what if I just say, I don't know but what I do know is this religion bullshit is fake. I could give a fuck if there's a big bang. I could care if we're on some dandilion that a Disney elephant talks to. There is just as much proof as that as there is a dude in the sky. But what you're not getting is I don't have to give a shit either way. I can take the evidence I DO HAVE, just go with that, and not give a shit about what I have no evidence to prove. In other words I don't have to have faith at all. I can take the premise that without logical evidence I don't know and I don't fucking care.

                                       That's where religion came from. Back in the day nobody knew shit. Then people started studying the stars, and because the stars actually show patterns and when they looked at the sky and the seasons, they could start to predict things like weather etc. So all the people we're like why are we here. And the astronomers knowing more than the average dude said.... Because of the stars and could predict things. Then they made religion based on the stars. To explain to the low life's why they existed. That doesn't mean I have to buy into that bullshit. Almost all religions are plagurized from others or it would appear that way but the real reason it appears that way is all of them are based on the same stars and the same yearly cycles of the world.

                                       The summer solstice and winter equinox.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Funny the flat earthers have a hard time explaining why these things occur, because you have to abandon what's proven and say it's a dude in the sky.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       But the proof is in your own statements.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       You say over and over at first I don't know the flat Earth model... It's all explained..
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Then when I call bullshit you fall back to the exact same excuse the round earth people do. It was god. It was a great bang.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Why not just say I don't know because that's not something I have any proof of?
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Well because that destroys the whole narrative. It makes no sense at all unless god made a snow globe.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       So what youre saying then is without any proof you have faith a dude in the sky made a snow globe.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Gotta say that's really not less crazy than most religion but it's based on about as much fact as any.

                                        And you don't think that NASA and the Fan Boy Star Wars and Star Trek and all the other space propaganda isn't a religion? Nothing has changed. And it's a false assumption to believe the ancients knew less. They arguably knew more about this world and nature than we do today. If you take a serious dive in every mainstream scientific belief, it's ALL bullshit. ALL OF IT. There is zero proof to any of it, even they admit it.

                                         Lololol now you go back to what's scientifically possible you gotta be kidding me. You're pushing a snow globe theory made by a man in the sky and if I say what if that's not true and provide a more reasonable by far explanation you switch back on the science. Sorry dude your ignoring much more unscientific shot you don't get to turn science back on. And how is it scientifically impossible. Don't have any answer besides faith. And that's just one of my what ifs. So again. Mind control is stong with you.

                                         Now sure all the space propaganda is bullshit, and you could even go as far as saying it's such an obsession it's like religion.

                                         And yeah mainstream science is mostly bullshit and it's easy to prove. But invoking god isn't a way to prove it bullshit. And sure the Sumerians seem to have known a lot. But also the Sumerians basically destroy any proof of religion so usually that is not discussed when trying to prove religion.all of it is mere speculation and if anything proof that religion is a bunch of BS.

                                           People need to be aware that there is a range of models that could explain the observations, “For instance, I can construct you a spherically symmetrical universe with Earth at its center, and you cannot disprove it based on observations. “You can only exclude it on philosophical grounds. In my view there is absolutely nothing wrong in that. What I want to bring into the open is the fact that we are using philosophical criteria in choosing our models. A lot of cosmology tries to hide that.”

                     I just want to re-iterate, first of all, that I don't want you to be silenced. I have a lot of admiration for people willing to put themselves out there with so much blowback in the world for sharing the wrong opinions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     My view of the moon landings being fake does not extend to flat earth. The earth is fully capable of being a sphere while simultaneously the moon landings were fake. The earth being flat would necessitate the moon landings being fake but not the other way around. The technology to land on the moon is coming, well, either it is or it isn't. But if it isn't the excuses they use are going to start getting harder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     A return to the moon would be harder to fake today than it was in 1969. We have better special effects, but there would be no excuse for loss of data as there once was. Even the data returned on astronaut's smart watch not being perfectly faked would expose the fraud.

                      And the reason why the Fe is gaining traction is every year nasa keeps promising to go to the moon and they keep failing even die hard boomers are asking why. Once you start asking these questions you begin to question ISS and the existence of satellites and if those don’t exist the question is why. The ISS and satellites not existing was hard for me to fathom

                       I haven't reached that stage, I'm pretty convinced satellites and the ISS are real, why wouldn't they be we're talking about low earth orbit. NASA has been caught, to my satisfaction, faking a number of things they could otherwise probably actually do and I can't figure out why they're so ok with it.

                        Decades of programming we were all taught the Heliocentric model, the Big Bang and moon landing. The hypnosis is so strong they don’t have to take much effort.

                        There’s just more and more questions to all this once you start looking. And I’m not 100% on Flat Earth what I can tell you is that “dark side” nasa gif is fake and nobody can tell me why their cgi moon is dark when it should be lit up.

                        I don’t have the answers, it’s clear though that the people who are supposed to know everything, don’t.

                         I'm not really willing to jump on the "solar system doesn't exist" bandwagon, all I'm saying is NASA lies and probably didn't land on the moon 50 years ago. Until more than 6% of the population wraps their head around this that's where I'll focus my energy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Even if you were correct imagine trying to explain that the solar system doesn't exist to someone who hasn't even gotten over the moon landing yet. That's what ends up happening every time one of you pops up. Because every time someone starts talking about the fake moon landings someone shows up and says either there are aliens on the moon, or the moon doesn't even exist, or whatever, then suddenly nobody is listening anymore.

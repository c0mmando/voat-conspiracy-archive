            I'm old enough to have seen both men perform and I recall when Nureyev retired he had a very short film career. I don't know what he did professionally, but he wasn't exactly omnipresent in the media. Baryishikov on the other hand did have a decent film career and is currently estimated to be worth $45 million dollars. He may not have wanted to be exposed in the media.

           <p>
            Can you cite a source for your estimation of the two men's net worth?

              I did. Your thesis is flawed because you assume the only reason for any disparity, if any, is that it's because one is a faggot and the other is heterosexual. As I pointed out, Baryishnikov is quite wealthy and probably isn't as much of an attention whore as Nureyev was. I'm certain Baryisnikov has had just as much media access and coverage as Nureyev. The media loves celebrities, gay or straight. Baryshnikov is also a much better actor. Did you ever see "Valentino" by Ken Russell? That was Nureyev's first venture into film acting and unfortunately his best, which wasn't very good.

            When it comes to conspriacies I think we need to concede a couple of things. Yes, they definitely happen all the time. But which ones are true and to which extent is very difficult to know with any certainty. I've researched many angles deeply and have never walked away sure of it. The problem with conspiracy is that in a system like capitalism where everyone strives to get as much as possible for themselves and power gets consolidated more and more as the system evolves, conspiracy is both inherent and perpetually inevitable.

             Imho, I believe truth comes from having multiple sources in your mind at once, with the background research already complete for more context.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once this is done hundreds of thousands of times, reliable patterns begin to emerge, like it's expected and you know in your heart what side is dark and what side is light.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where confusion arises is usually where a new "actor" or event is pushed into the spotlight and we need more info to determine anything of value. Keeping in mind of course, these types of events have been designed to confuse the populace, hence why they are promoted (typo), so it can take years for people to begin grasping what has actually taken place over the last 70 to 100 years.

            Of course it's a theory, I never claimed anything was a fact.
            <em>
             However
            </em>
            , there is overwhelming circumstantial evidence to support such theory. 
Just like the OJ trial. 
The circumstantial evidence was overwhelming, but there was little physical evidence.

            <p>
             I will say this though, the OJ trial was the perfect political psyop weapon to foment conflict between white and black people. Those in control know they must do whatever they can to constantly promote a new enemy, cause infighting and chaos, so that they can continue committing their crimes against humanity, going to war, and profiting from destroying and rebuilding countries abroad.

            The dilemma is to still come off as credible and not be played off as loony after the initial discrediting. You can't convince brainwashed people of anything, since they will make every effort to try to debunk you, and strongly feel that they are right and you are wrong. Or they will have the gall to say you went "too far" when presenting your evidence. They are stuck in their own reality fully unaware of the true facts. It's a catch 22: how are we supposed to speak out about this CIA smear campaign, if doing so only perpetuates it even further.

             Exactly, I might be pushing friends away but I will argue a point if they say something like, I really admire what Bezos has been doing, or what Obama has accomplished. I feel the urge to point out some of the negative things they've done.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course I dont think my "friends" would push me away, since I don't do this all the time, just planting seeds every so often. I can sense some of them come around, like say things I said months ago, so that's good. But yeah that catch 22 isdefinitely an obstacle we need to tread lightly over.

            Explain to them that a detective is a conspiracy theorist. A detective follows clues to piece together what most likely happened and then presents it to someone who then tries to pick it apart. If the theory stands, it becomes a fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only difference is that some people can't fathom that a person who has not been given the title of detective can do the same type of research on other subjects. "you're not a detective, you can't possibly do that"

            I'd favor the term "truther" as in "someone who's concerned about getting at the truth," except this term was co-opted and rendered worthless by the "9-11 was an inside job" people.

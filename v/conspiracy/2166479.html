Is an official counter terrorism source saying that the Islamic state is now moving into the Philippines and other parts of Asia.

This dropped Saturday. It goes into detail discussing improvised weapons taken from ANTIFA protests. Of the two reports this one is the most alarming, as it now cites everyday objects as &quot;weapons&quot; giving the authorities probable cause to arrest just about anyone who goes to a protest. </p>
<p>Now, what is rather odd is that right after both of these reports dropped into the public analyst community, MULTIPLE terror attacks happened: France, Canada, and Las Vegas.

This was a narrative that was established in the 80s as justification to aid the mujahideen in their defense against the soviets, and it appears to be brought back as a means to possibly extend and expand patriot act measures against political groups that have fallen out of favor. </p>

            OK. I'm good with that. Mainly because I have excellent genes and am ever so bored with Satanists.

  'formattedContent' => '<p>This headline is tantamount to the view most people have on politics. They see a fight, and it\'s given a lot of importance by the media, so people think it matters. </p>
<p>It\'s just a game, being played for our entertainment, given the appearance of being important. One of my favorite quote of all time says it best:</p>
<p>&quot;Politics is just the entertainment branch of the military-industrial complex&quot; - Frank Zappa</p>
<p>Politics is a game. The fact Trump is president literally doesn\'t matter. It has some minute effect, sure, but the deep state has been running the show for somewhere between 100 years and 40 years, depending on how you draw the cutoff. The deep state being the military-industrial-banking complex that Eisenhower warned of during his presidential departure speech. The same one that JFK spoke of during his &quot;Secret societies&quot; speech, 3 months before he was assassinated. </p>
<p>It\'s a joooooooke. Nothing in politics should be taken remotely seriously, or treated as if it represents a people. Nations of people are essentially taken hostage by organized assholes, who undergo this rigmarole of &quot;democracy&quot; to convince us that we\'re in control of this thing. We\'re not. It\'s a big club and we\'re not in it. We are not in the club. </p>
<p>There\'s no question there exist powerful people from all nationalities and corporations trying to gain power over America, as well as gain power over every other damn country in the world. The idea of a nation is simply a boundary where nationalized troops stopped fighting. A war ends when one side runs out of soldiers. Nations are little different than a king\'s domain, but with the illusion of citizen control. Even the word &quot;citizen&quot; itself is a creation of our era, designed around this style of thinking. </p>
<p>Politics is a joke. Politics is kabuki theatre. It\'s puppets with Jeff Dunham. It\'s meaningless. It\'s bullshit. It\'s garbage. Garbage that is designed to give us the illusion of controlling our destiny, so we can get <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oNfVQ-7M-VQ/THFTY65XDgI/AAAAAAAAAP4/ohnlB1ZUoXo/s1600/march_of_tyranny.jpg">screwed by the donkey or screwed by the elephant.</a> Either way, they get what they want, and the populace gets the illusion of choice. Pepsi vs coke, and I\'m over here drinking water. It\'s not real. It also instills divide and conquer mechanisms by dividing the public in half, who vehemently fight against each other, and deem their half superior to the &quot;other&quot; half. </p>
<p>It is time to awaken from our many-thousand-year slumber. It is time to see the hierarchy for what it is. The pecking order is real, but the hen house is the Earth. Let us do away with the misconception that government is by the people, for the people. It is not. We all know it is not, in some moments. Yet we pretend with Hillary vs Trump like it fucking matters which Israel-firster is the one to push the button to bomb Syria.  
</p>
<p>This is not a game. This is the real world. This is not a dress rehearsal. This is not an act, or some elaborate troll. This is the truth, and we all see it sitting right in front of us, clear as the nose on our face. But we are afraid to say it. Afraid to even see it. Be afraid no longer. </p>
<p>Here we are, it\'s 2017. The world is owned by billionaires. How are we going to fix it? How are we going to explain it to others who don\'t know? What is even the point of this shit? Is this some bad dream? </p>
<p>We must awaken, we must become lucid here in this world, it is the only answer. We must become aware. When we are awake, we say what we believe, and we say it from the heart. Nothing can defeat that, in the long run. Look at the Streisand effect from the execution of Jesus Christ by the Roman state, and the lasting power that has had over 2000 years. What we truly feel, the understanding of the truth we have from our perspectives, this means something. This is real, even if it is not complete. </p>
<p>When we put our hidden feelings in to speech or action, the world changes. And what does the world need now more than change from the path of the status quo? Are we done pretending yet?</p>',

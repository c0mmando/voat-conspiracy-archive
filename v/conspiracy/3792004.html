            It took a good 2 years to figure out that Bitcoin was taken over by an insider group that was censoring alternative viewpoints.  The feeling of confusion and uncertainty is the same as what is now happening.  The amount of disinformation and manipulation is the same.  Coming from a libertarian bent, I sided with Trump, but also living through 9/11 made me very conspiratorially minded.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only real thing that is clear is that there is a power struggle going on, and someone or group is feeding lots of disinformation.  The more I look for patterns, the clearer the picture becomes, but still not clear enough.  One key to understanding the picture is the existence of the Neo-Conservatives in the Trump administration.  It is not clear what they are doing there but with their moves around 9/11, it makes me very suspicious of the Trump administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other patterns:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Corona virus seems very similar to the 9/11 false flag.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The push to blame China seems to be a dividing issue.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The "Anglo Saxon" culture and dominance vs. world government/republic seems to be a major theme.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Look for people who claim to be satanists who support Trump (e.g. Styxhexenhimer666).  I suspect that this is also a key issue.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Restoring America as a Christian culture is also a theme. (As opposed to the move to culturally destroy America for globalism.)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            When you see these issues, you can kinda understand the motives behind the speakers or at least the puppet masters pulling their strings (black mail, threats of violence to loved ones, etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want more on the Neo-Conservatives, look up:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Adam Curtis - The Power of Nightmares"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Nick Fuentes and Conservatives Inc."
           </p>
           <p>
            My gut is telling me that the Neo-Conservatives were behind 9/11, and that the virus release was also a false flag by these neo-cons to stir up war with China.  However, the move backfired, because now the Petro Dollar is dead (oil is super cheap), and no new laws to control society have been issued.
           </p>
           <p>
            From a different perspective, go read what Benjamin Fulford is blogging about.  He's claiming that China has refused to extend any more credit to the America and that America is (was) bankrupt, and that "white hats" are working to neutralize the "satanists/Zionists".  He also calls out Leo Zagami as a satanist, while American Intelligence Media calls him a hero.  AIM also call "Q" out as fake, but also praises Trump.  So, again, the dividing patterns on China, satirists, and globalism vs. nationalism are key "limpness tests" to finding out what side of the power structure the individuals fall.  Also, it looks like Stefan Molyneux is falling on the side of the neo-conservatives, possibly because he was threatened.  He's denounced "Q" and is praising the advantages of Christianity.  He also seems to have lost his self respect.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, it looks like Trump is just a pawn in this power struggle.  The "white hats" are working to remove the "satanists", but at the same time are looking to avoid civil war by removing Trump, but instead have dirt on him to ensure he cannot go to far.  The neo-cons also don't want to cause a civil war because they need a Strong America to dominate the world.  From this perspective, the military is infected by the Satanists, but the CIA and other intelligence might be free of their control.  (AIM often called for martial law years before the virus release and demonizes the CIA as corrupt.) The lock down serves as a way to keep the civilian population out of the way so that these factions can fight without upsetting the population.
           </p>
           <p>
            My take: America is stuck between groups.  On seeks globalism at the expense of destroying Western culture, while the other (Neo-Con/Zionists) who want a strong America as a weapon to dominate the world.  One group seeks to destroy Western culture by creating thousands of laws and promoting degeneracy (think "Brave New World"), while the other group uses deception and lies to use America as the weapon for world domination while pushing a theocracy and to have Western culture dominate.

            Communist + perversion they want to control everyone, if you to smart, they corn hole then kill you, and let everyone know, they corn holed you. Fascism + perversion they want to control everyones factory/business, but if you to dumb to produce and work, they corn hole you and kill you, but hide it so no one knows,  that they corn holed you. (Both groups are the same, controlled behind the scenes by the same people, the super corn holers *who are they? the priest) This has been the trend for wordly affairs, so will you be the corn holer, or the corn holee?

            Christians and Jews destroyed Rome. Downfall happened when the Catholic Church rose to power. Then open borders. Then muh culturally diverse emos and goths invaded because they didn't build a wall.

           <p>
            Democracy is great when it works. It worked in early Rome, but by the first century BC it had stopped working. Wealthy and corrupt men controlled the Senate, and used their power to enrich themselves at the expense of the Roman Empire. The rule of democracy broke down, which is why Julius Caesar felt both the need and the opportunity to make himself dictator of Rome. The Senate, in a last gasp of moral outrage, murdered him in the Senate chamber, but democracy never returned to Rome. Once gone, it was gone for good.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rome went on to have good times and bad times. When there was a good dictator in power, times were generally prosperous, but when a bad dictator took office, conditions deteriorated. That's what happens when your standard of living depends on the whims of a single man.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the few centuries following the murder of Julius Caesar other circumstances arose that contributed to the decline of Rome. The people became accustomed to welfare and not needing to work to feed themselves. Rome had a daily "grain dole" in which they gave every citizen of Rome a measure of food every day. All you had to do was line up and get it. Entertainment was free as well. Anyone could go into the circuses, as they were called, and watch various gladitorial displays or pornographic displays.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sex and blood kept the people diverted. This suited the small number of men who actually ran the Roman Empire, but it weakened Rome, because the jobs Romans were no longer willing to do had to be done by slaves or foreign mercenaries. The people of Rome lost control of these areas in their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eventually the foreigners living in Rome became very numerous. When emergencies arose, these foreigners were not willing to risk their lives to defend various outposts of the Empire, or even the city of Rome itself, because it wasn't their empire, or their city. They were barbarians --  why would they risk their lives to protect temples to gods they didn't understand and didn't worship? Why would they protect the farms that fed the population of the city when they were not making any profit from those farms, and were not related to those who owned them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Religious worship broke down and devolved into a hundred different foreign cults that overwhelmed the native and generally wholesome religion of the Romans. The army became manned and commanded by Germans and other foreign barbarians who cared nothing about the customs, the history, or the people of Rome. There were there for what they could get for themselves, and that was all. When the army of foreign mercenaries was confronted by another barbarian army, sometimes they fought, and sometimes they didn't. The army became undependable. Eventually the army was used against the citizens of Rome to instill foreign barbarians as dictators of the Empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, let me sum up a few of the things that caused Rome to collapse:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             welfare in the form of the daily grain dole, allowing Romans not to work
            </li>
            <li>
             political corruption which destroyed the democratic system and gave rise to the dictatorship
            </li>
            <li>
             prostitution and circuses which corrupted the morals of ordinary Romans
            </li>
            <li>
             a rejection of the moral code of the original Roman religion by the Roman people
            </li>
            <li>
             a refusal of young Roman men to join the Roman army
            </li>
            <li>
             an open-door policy to foreigners, which flooded Rome with non-Romans
            </li>
            <li>
             a bewildering confusion of foreign religions in the city, all with their own cults
            </li>
            <li>
             control over the army by Germans and other barbarians
            </li>
            <li>
             a string of very bad dictators, many of the foreigners, culminating in the sack of Rome
            </li>
           </ul>

            You know there was 6 different Rome’s I total right?
White women evny white men, thus import our enemies and turn to denegerates, perverts and criminal unless we pay them not too nowadays. Thus we are alreadywell over the point of no return.
I’d also say the Third World War has started this year. It’s a war of culture, and religion, mixed with race and sexuality which will cause another collapse globally.

            White women stabbing white men in the back for their greed and lust.
Here’s my favourite quote from Rome. Good old Tiberius would be proud.
           </p>
           <p>
            "A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear. The traitor is the plague."
Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 B.C.) Roman Statesman, Philosopher and Orator

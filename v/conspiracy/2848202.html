            Chicago has had a amusement tax for like 3 years now. I had to pay the shit for steam games when i lived there. It's added on any digital good. Fucking city full of NPC's and retarded/violent brown people. The only reason to live in Chicago is if you have money, and are a thoughtless hedonist.

            chicago actually taxes all Illinois citizens, whether you live there or not.  For example, the overwhelming majority of state revenues are spent in chicago.  Illinois just elected the worst moron possible, who already is planning on increasing taxes to give to his cronies in chicago, and told the voters he would do so before the election!  95% of Illinois voted for Rauner, but 5% voted for him, so he got elected.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who think that statement makes no sense, look at a map of who voted for who - chicago CONTROLS the state.  We need a Brexit!

             Don't forget about the 1% tax that Illinois puts on all residents that goes to the reinsdorfs white Sox team.

            <p>
             What does that 1% go too?  To put on a concert every year and to pay their fucking rent.

            Rush Limbaugh was talking about the debt there a few months ago.
            <br/>
            Everyone in Chicago and even IL needs to get out now. Consider yourself in Detroit before the White flight.
            <br/>
            The politicians are about to start making home values worthless jacking up the property taxes. They are shaving thousands off of property values and they are going to create a downward feedback loop.
            <br/>
            Bring your White ass to a White city, a White state.

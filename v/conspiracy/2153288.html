             the history of fluoridation
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Almost 30 years after the conclusion of the Grand Rapids fluoridation study, fluoride continues to be dental science's main weapon in the battle against tooth decay. Today, just about every toothpaste on the market contains fluoride as its active ingredient; water fluoridation projects currently benefit over 200 million Americans, and 13 million schoolchildren now participate in school-based fluoride mouth rinse programs. As the figures indicate, McKay, Dean, and the others helped to transform dentistry into a prevention-oriented profession.

            It effects children during pregnancy.  If you were born in a place without fluoridated water and move there when you're 1, live you're whole life there, it might not necessarily effect you.  If you do the opposite, high levels of fluoride during pregnancy, move elsewhere after birth, you're already fucked.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not necessarily retardation either.  If you genetically could have had an IQ of 130 and could have been a neurosurgeon, now you're not smart enough.
The study also mentions fluoride gave rats ADHD symptoms.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question shouldn't be "should I care?"  The question should be "who should be murdered along with their family for perpetrating such a devastating fraud that has negatively effected the lives of millions of people?"

             Great answer. It's the same when I point out dental amalgams are a source of toxic mercury. Inevitably I get the counter argument from someone "well, I have them, and it hasn't affected me".

             How do you know? Perhaps you could have been a brain surgeon, and instead you're now just flipping burgers. A single person will never know, because there is no copy of you to compare to. We can just statistically estimate, that everyone has been harmed. It's a horrible thought, to think of what we might have missed as a society, culturally and intellectually, because of things like this, and not to speak of individual suffering because of adverse harm, as can be the case with dental amalgams.

             But hey, in the end some corporate executives got good bonuses, so it has to be worth it, right?

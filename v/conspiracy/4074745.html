            Interesting.  Do you by any chance know of any other footage that shows no planes?  The engine doesn't match for sure and it is strange that the same floors in the lighting display was what was struck by planes.

             This guy Allan presents some of the purported footage of the planes side by side in this video.  He's doing it in the context of getting a photographer's take on it, but the discrepancies in the footage are pretty clear even in

              Thank you for this.  I feel for the guy trying to show his friend with him flip flopping and insisting that "everything is OK" and "the government is good".  This is a real phenomenon.  I have friends that know about 9/11 but insist on not going into the JQ.  Others know about Covid, but couldn't possibly believe global warming isn't real.  They couldn't possibly believe the holocaust was faked even though the acknowledge the holodomor happened.

              People who see truth are alone, my friend. It really seems that Orwell wasn't talking about a future time, but was talking about all time and knew the nature of mankind well.

               Agreed-- peoples' defense mechanisms go into full swing when facing the cognitive dissonance that comes from the wool being pulled away and facing the truth for the first time.  I went through a period of that myself when first looking into these issues, and it took me a while to accept reality... I actually went through a period of depression of sorts from the full face of just how f-ed up everything is, and how much power the elites have over all of us by keeping the truth from us.  Now it's hard for me to talk with people about these extremely important frauds because even my conservative friends aren't willing to accept that our own government has lied to us on numerous and deep levels.

                Clearly the affirmation of what one believes is the greatest addiction to mankind.   People don't even know where they get their ideas from.  They judge what the evidence means before they can accept it and so become qualitative in their search for the truth without the ability to resolve what the evidence means, so they jump forward and accept the unlikely in order to avoid the obvious.

                By any chance are you a fan of prospect theory (Dan Ariely, Daniel Khanneman, etc.)?  There's a bunch of interesting experiments in the last century that are documented and it becomes pretty clearly shows that under cognitive load the anxiety becomes so high we search for the end of the burn and will accept solutions presented if they stop the loading.  Attention span is key, especially the ability to go through multiphase logical steps holding a paradox in conscious memory to flesh out an idea.  The subversion going on is made easy through cognitive exhaustion through media and other sources.  The matrix of cognitive connections becomes impossible to untangle without major triggering and having someone forced to slow down.  Also, all of the other distractions eat up all cognitive ability with fiction and entertainment.

                This shows itself every day when I can get friends to agree that we're basically being genocided but hold dear next Tuesdays appointment rather than flushing out what to do.

                 I haven't read up on prospect theory, but it sounds like something I'd be interested in.  Thanks for the suggestion!  I've read Kahneman's book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" where he talks about many of our cognitive biases and mental shortcuts that we rely on subconsciously, and that was pretty interesting.

                 The cognitive overload idea makes sense, and I think it's why people are buying ridiculous claims like "Russian propaganda" without any evidence-- it stops the cognitive dissonance by allowing them to completely dismiss any information that goes against their worldview.

                   Thanks for the links, I'll check them out.  The history of the Illuminati is very interesting, and the fact that it's been covered up and associated with "crazy conspiracy theorists" today tells me that these organizations did not disappear.  What I'm unsure about is the role of these organizations in founding the US.  It would just kill me to think that our country and its groundbreaking principles of forming a balanced democratic republic with a bill of rights were the result of backroom elites, but it could be the case-- we definitely have Masonic imagery all over our government institutions.  I'd like to think that we once had a country founded on great principles, but it was corrupted over time... but that doesn't make it true just because I want it to be!

                  If you read "Thinking Fast and Slow" you know about Prospect Theory because that's what he writes about.  There are many other authors though, many labelled "self help" and "business non-fiction".  Things go back a long way, for example Adam Weishaupt utilized "illuminism" which is a subliminal form of subversion over the overt form of coercion.  Basically, getting people to act in a way that benefits you, but also keeping the person doing the action from knowing it was not their own idea.  It's basically behavioral theory mixed with advertising.  You can read about some of it in E. Micheal Jones's book "Libido Dominandi" as well as Edward Bernais book "Propaganda".
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Consider from "Thinking Fast and Slow" the
                  <em>
                   availability heuristic
                  </em>
                  and the other concept of remembering the most significant event and last event.  The persistent drip, drip, drip of the Covid narrative (availability) has people doing the duty and wearing masks even when the virus isn't even isolated or proven real.  This behavior is reinforced by the pain of seeing someone on the news being berated and called selfish at a grocery store that doesn't wear a mask, or being thanked for wearing one at the door on their way out.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In the case of the "Russian Propaganda" it is clearly availability heuristic.  They hear it a million times, and never check other perspectives, so it becomes truth in their mind and they can't see any way it isn't truth.  Press them on the details and you get a major cognitive load resulting in RHEEEEEEE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you delve into prospect theory, you'll come to the distinct conclusion like I have that we are literally surrounded by non-thinking zombies.  Knowledge of this concept is one of the first steps to breaking out of it because people are not unaware of how easily their mind can be tricked.  Then, after some awareness one must vigilantly look for other ideas and explanations and test against the things we think are true.  Using this method, consider again such things as: The Cold War, Nuclear Weapons, Korean and Vietnam Wars, WW1 and WW2, The Holocaust, The Holodomor, The Moon Landing, among other things.  Also consider that people are often triggered not knowing so bring other ideas and beliefs to compartmentalize their mental state in order to bring perceived order and you have all kinds of other interesting ideas like: Hitler used magic, Nazis are in Antarctica, Aliens and UFOs, Flat Earth, Creationism, etc.

                  All you are really left with in the end is a series of things one can reject as unlikely and some left over correlations that seem to work for predictions ... meanwhile searching persistently for debunking your current models for better correlations/models.

                   You're right in that I'm already familiar with many of the pieces of prospect theory-- I've just never seen all the pieces put together into a coherent theory of how people act and placed into our current context.  I think this is an excellent summary of what's going on in the world today, and potentially what's been happening for a long time.  There's a reason why the elites want to control the media, as shaping the narrative will result in far easier control over the people than threats of force ever would.  It's been a long, slow process deprogramming myself from all the narratives they've ingrained in me for so long.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I see what you're saying about how people bring in other ideas like aliens to try to understand the world, but I'm not sure that's the main cause of "flat earth" or other "truther" movements like Q-anon.  I think the powers that be push these types of ridiculous theories in order to both distract people from true conspiracies and discredit those who question things... for example, I've been attacked as a "flat earther" for questioning the moon landing, because people are programmed to associate these together.  I think these movements are pushed on purpose to keep people from looking into space hoaxes like the moon landing, the ISS, the space shuttle, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, I'm not sure what to think about UFOs, Antartica, etc-- I think there is some evidence that something strange was, or is, going on there.  I doubt it's "Nazis", but I think there are some people who have access to some highly advanced aircraft and there have been plenty of unexplained sightings of some strange aerial phenomena.  I think "aliens" is a disinformation campaign just like "flat earth" to hide the fact that the elites have access to way more advanced technology than combustion engines.  Of course, I could have just been led down a purposefully made fake rabbit hole in order to distract me from other true conspiracies... it's so hard to discern between them sometimes!

                <p>
                 At this moment and for the next few mo the we are going to see more disassociation from reality as everyone socializes less and less over the winter (and through possible lockdowns.)

                 On the subject of 9/11, I remember a video around 2005 that breaks down the video editing errors that purportedly introduced “plane” footage into the view from the helicopter from the other side, including a protruding fibreglass nose cone that should have been smashed To pieces upon hitting the outer structure of the building but instead somehow showed itself poking out the exit hole during the explosion. I will look for it, there are so many videos on the subject.

                  I think I saw this video a while back and am for sure interested if you find it. I also saw somewhere a doc about the Israeli art students and it seemed the light display was exactly the same floors as the explosions, but I will have to confirm that it was "exactly" the floors.

             Well apparently she's broke and asked the guy if he recognized her and then openly discussed being a porn star. The answer is free alcohol.

            Same shit happens to me about 4 times a year.  The most recent one (((probably))) killed herself in March.  :(  I haven't been able to save one in time yet, and I've told myself I'm going to quit trying.  They've always contacted me on dating sites so I don't even have profile on any of them anymore.

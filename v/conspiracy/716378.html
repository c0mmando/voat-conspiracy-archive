            You know there are "mothers" who kill their own children?  Not that you're necessarily wrong but thats a shaky line of reasoning.  Giving birth doesn't magically turn someone into a benevolent creature unable to commit violence.

            A false flag might be agreeable since it's unclear enough.

            Blaming Russia, I doubt it. Russia doesn't want more presence of the US the middle east. They even keep to only insult and threat Turkey after the SU-24 shootdown.

           <p>
            Some party who would like more US involvement is IMO more likely the culprit. Or some party within the US who would profit.

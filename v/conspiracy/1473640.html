  'formattedContent' => '<p>On November 23, 2016 and November 30, 2016 the EU and US political establishments, respectively, voted into existence the effective declarations of war on any and all individuals and entities, who operate from anywhere on this planet, that both establishments deem dangerous opposition against the establishments\' dominance, power and oppression systems and doctrines that have been implemented during the past 3 centuries.</p>
<p>EU Parliament</p>
<p>Under the pretext of countering Russian and islamic propaganda (information warfare) the EU parliament voted in favor of a resolution called &quot;EU Strategic Communication to Counteract Anti-EU Propaganda by Third Parties&quot;. 44% of the members of the EU parliament voted for (304 votes), only 26% of the MEPs voted against (179 votes), while the remaining 208 votes were registered as abstentions(!).</p>
<p>US House of Representatives</p>
<p>Under the pretext of countering &quot;active measures by Russia to exert covert influence over peoples and governments&quot; the US House of Representatives voted in favor of Bill H.R.6393 - Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 with 390 votes to 30.</p>
<p>Effectively</p>
<p>As described above, these declarations of war represent the official announcements of initiating effective (information) warfare against any person, business or organization that dares to publicly or even privately doubt or oppose the narratives as they are scripted by the mainstream press, their government and corporate overlords.</p>
<p>No deviations from the &quot;political correct&quot; paths will be accepted anymore - it is thereby claimed, no matter from where or from who the alleged uncontrolled extremism or opposition comes.</p>
<p>By simply claiming that someone or a certain organization operates at Russia\'s behest, or that of islamic extremists, the MEPs, the EU Commission and the US government will give themselves a free pass each time they want to target individuals and organizations, each time they want to illegally organize witch hunts and each time they want to exterminate opposition and pockets of resistance or freedom fighters - whenever and wherever.</p>
<p>Since World War 2 this is the first time in modern history that governments have so openly declared a hot war on their own and at the same time at foreign populations of alleged allied nations.</p>
<p>We, Intel Sector Members, acknowledge these declarations of war against us too and will therefore shift to higher gears with our operations to liberate the world from these evil incrementalist establishments\' grip.</p>
<p>No matter which lobby or sect or order is planning to come after us, we\'ll meet them at least half way each and ever time!</p>
<p>UPDATE 1</p>
<p>The Vatican</p>
<p>On December 7, 2016 the Vatican, through the head of the catholic church pope Francis, seemingly backed the Declarations of War, as described above, in an interview with a Belgian religious magazine (Tertio).</p>
<p>Francis was quoted as saying, by the full press spectrum, that spreading and consuming &quot;fake&quot; news (a.k.a. Russian or islamic propaganda) basically is a sin that leads to, figuratively, eating faeces.</p>
<p>According to the Vatican, now a proven war ally of the EU and the US government, defaming and publicly exposing politicians through \'fake\' news - or alternative media reporting / a.k.a. news distribution on Russia\'s and islamic extremist\'s behest - is a path that should not be traveled.</p>
<p>Instead, according to the Vatican apparently, we the people are only allowed to turn the other cheek, as the boot of oppression and extermination stamps on our faces indefinitely.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2</p>
<p>The Purple Revolution, in the USA, Has Begun</p>
<p>On December 8, 2016 during the unveiling of Harry Reid\'s portrait Hillary Clinton - dressed in purple - called for &quot;bipartisan&quot; support for combating the &quot;fake news&quot; and &quot;malicious false propaganda&quot; threat.</p>
<p>This scripted development, as one could expect, is completely in line with the Declarations of War mentioned earlier and this all will eventually receive the full support of the Trump regime.</p>
<p>UPDATE 3</p>
<p>Even before the Vatican and Clinton voiced their apparent support for the Declarations of War (above) the Trump Transition team already had closed the ranks in D.C. by firing, or pressuring to resign, Michael G. Flynn for publicly spreading &quot;fake&quot; news and giving support to fringe conspiracy theories. (intelsector.com)</p>',

            I usually don't answer to these types of posts, because they hit too close to home. However, I do want to add something to it, which is this; "Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups" and "In a mad world only the mad are sane". Two stupid quotes which, unfortunately, are all too real. I think I have been through the same thoughts, as you so eloquently described, a couple of times now. Like a repeating cycle of the

            , till a point of numbness where you constantly ask yourself the question "What's the fucking point?". I didn't found an answer yet. A bit of spirituality does help in accepting that the journey counts and not the end. Take it one step at a time, making each day a bit more special by doing something nice for others or selfish-crazy-fun. Don't end up like a depressed fearless apathetic asshole like I was years ago.

            Yeah the first paragraph pretty much sums it up. I am a painter and dancer and its pretty much what I live for.  Without them as outlets theres a good chance I would have offed my self by now. Only partially kidding about that haha. I will check out all of those books, I just recently finished alan watts Tao the watercourse way. Buddhism/Tao are pretty much the only religions I can relate to at all, not that they are technically religions but yeah. I have done a shit ton of LSD and have had two genuine DMT experiences that changed my life forever. Definitely the most beautiful experience of my life, I died and realized how trivial all the pain i felt in my old body was and I really just let go of my fear.  after I came back into my body I felt this huge weight was lifted and realized It was my fear of death  and I cant keep living in fear of the future because it really doesnt matter in that infinite space. It was one of the realest things ive ever felt but I guess theres no way of knowing if it was "real". Anyways, Im not even depressed about it.. just hopeless... but its not all bad because letting go of that fear has encouraged me to do as much fun shit as possible and travel the world before it all goes down the toilet. Its tragic and beautiful but the tragedy has helped me cherish the beauty so much more.

             I am very frustrated, and apathetic. Its not all bad though, my pessimism about the future has encouraged me to live my life to the fullest. I have been to 25 countries in the past 5 years and I take in beauty like its my last day on earth. Bitter sweet indeed.

              Man those are pretty mature thoughts for a 24 year old.  When I was 24 I was thinking about Pizza, chicks and video games.
             </p>
             <p>
              But seriously, I am glad to see that someone your age is not asleep at the wheel and just blindly listening to the manufactured media in this country now.  I honestly fear that for there to be any real change in this country it is going to have to happen in your age crowd.  When I spout the same stuff, no one takes me seriously - I am simply and angry old white dude who does not want to change my ways.
             </p>
             <p>
              But when a bunch of young, strong, angry 24 year olds take it to the streets and say the same stuff?  Hell - it will mean a lot more.   And guess what - a lot of us in our 30s and 40s will be backing you guys up because we are sick of it too...

               I agree that our age group might be the only hope left. All of my close friends feel the same way that I do and are very pissed off, just lacking direction in how to even begin to try and change things. I have pretty much no hope for these kids growing up now who are 3 years old and already glued to an ipad and on adderal. When the time comes I will be taking to the street, and were long overdue for a revolution... it just makes me wonder how much more of this people are going to take before we revolt.

                I have been wondering that too.  Seems like in the 60's your age group would take to the streets frequently.  Now days it seems like your age group has a much higher threshold to reach before it gets pissed off at the current corrupt system that has taken control of our country.  I attribute this to the constant "tranquilizers" that have been fed to your age group in the form of expensive phones, stupid reality TV, online-everything, porn, etc.   It's hard to realize you are living in a jail cell when the bars are blocked by distracting bullshit.   But I am hopeful, because it sounds like you guys are starting to see it and that is a good thing.   Take the Red Pill.

             I also feel synchronized to chime in here.

             From the way OP describes our inner and outer worlds, you can sense that they are actually a reflection of each other. We are going through natural reaction of discovering the truth, trying to do something about it, running into a wall and now standing back thinking wtf. It is because we went Solo vs Team with established strategy to mute us.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am here for the same reason, figure out how to team up.

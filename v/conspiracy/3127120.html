<p><strong>The American BAR Association (ABA) Is In Control</strong></p>
<p>&quot;A 1996 article that still applies ...</p>
<p>Neither law nor elected representatives govern America. Our nation is controlled and manipulated by a committee of lawyers, the American BAR (fly) Association, the infamous BAR(flies), who care not about us but about themselves and their wealth.</p>
<p>In September 1995, for the first time in American history, the inflow of tax revenues was less than our government had pay on just the interest it owes. In other words, our Federal government can\'t even pay the interest on the loans they\'ve promised to pay to mostly foreign entities. So, we decided to dig deeper into how this came about. What we uncovered is shocking, to say the very least.</p>
<p>It seems that the crafty powers that control this great land behind the scenes are about to choke us into submission. The United States, Incorporated declared bankruptcy, once again, in 1933. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the author of American socialism, declared this in Executive Orders 6073, 6102, 6111, and 6260.  At the same time, all gold and silver was taken away from We the People. This was done pursuant to the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917 when our entire nation was placed under an economic &quot;emergency&quot;.....</p>

<p>&quot;Augustus Blackstone suggests that the sovereignty and wealth of America is  being turned back to the Crown of England through Admiralty Jurisdiction.  This may very well be the case.  In the early 50s Norman Dodd was the Director of Research for a Congressional investigation into the tax-exempt Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie foundations.  What he discovered was that these foundations were working together to control the educational system of America so that Americans would be indoctrinated into the principles of collectivism as opposed to the principles in the original united States’ Constitution and Declaration of Independence. </p>
<p>Furthermore, here is what Mr. Dodd stated about Mr. Carnegie:  “His publicly declared and steadfast interest was to counteract the departure of the colonies from Great Britain.  He was devoted just to putting the pieces back together again.”  Mr. Dodd indicated that it was the <strong>bankers and lawyers</strong> who were making this possible.</p>
<p>Today the courts in America do in fact display a gold-fringed Admiralty flag.  However, the judges and prosecutors of the Bar Association always refuse to reveal the jurisdiction when asked.  The jurisdiction is a secret that they do not want people to know about.  This means that the Bar Association is, in fact, a secret society.</p>

<p><strong>Who Is Running America?</strong></p>
<p>Under the doctrine of Parens Patriae, &quot;Government As Parent&quot;, as a result of the manipulated bankruptcy of the United States of America in 1930, ALL the assets of the American people, their person, and of our country itself are held by the Depository Trust Corporation at 55 Water Street, NY, NY, secured by UCC Commercial Liens, which are then monetized as &quot;debt money&quot; by the Federal Reserve. It may interest you to know that under the umbrella of the Depository Trust Corporation lies the CEDE Corporation, the Federal Reserve Corporation and the American Bar Association, the legal arm of the banking interests.</p>
<p>Now you know who is running America!</p>

           <p>
            In 1938, a homosexual psychopath named Alfred Kinsey established an eponymous “institute” in the United States. Kinsey, who had studied under ✡Sigmund Freud✡ and ✡Magnus Hirschfield✡, took their work to its furthest extreme. He undertook a “study” which faked statistical data on sexual experiences. And experimented on children. In 1949, Sexuality in the Human Male was published.
           </p>
           <p>
            Partially comprised of data collected through interviews of subjects’ “sexual histories,” Kinsey used a questionnaire derived from Hirschfeld’s work to normalize homosexuality and transsexuality. The book made its claims without scientific study, objective evidence, or even verification of the survey’s respondents. Kinsey reported, among other things, that “more than one male in three” surveyed had had a homosexual encounter, and that half of adolescents on farms had sex with their animals. But his worst–and real–actions were on children. Kinsey took after Freud, in that he believed even children were “sexual beings” that were simply “repressing” their urges. Kinsey sought to “prove” Freud’s assertion. To do so, he and his team sexually molested hundreds of children, down to two months old, and then wrote about it publicly in great detail. They stimulated the genitals of these children and recorded when they thought the children had “orgasms.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Four years later, Kinsey released his second report, Sexuality in the Human Female. You may guess as to its contents. These reports were a necessary prerequisite for the sexual revolution. Kinsey was well funded and heavily promoted by media in the US, which already had immense jewish ownership. He presented this “data” in a form that suggested scientific value. His conclusions were that most Americans were “already” sexual degenerates, which furthered the social “justification” for the “emancipation” of sexuality. If a majority of the public was guilty of violating criminal sex laws, after all, those laws may as well be done away with, or so their thinking went. ✡Morris Ernst✡, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, and ✡David Goldstein Loth✡ published a book in tandem with Kinsey’s first work, titled American Sexual Behavior and the Kinsey Report. Pure coincidence, of course. They advocated the repeal of all sex crime laws in the US, including homosexuality and pedophilia.

             Notice the “one-two punch” here.
            </strong>
            Jews in the media present a document detailing the serial rape of children as “scientific data.” Jews in social activist positions then list this “data” as justification for destroying the laws and societies of non-jews. Kinsey’s “data” was subsequently presented to the Harvard Law Review, by ✡Herbert Wechsler✡, who in 1952 argued that “too many” sexual criminals were being imprisoned. Wechsler eventually became the director of the American Law Institute and drafted the 1955 Model Penal Code, which–surprise!–called for the abolition of all sexual laws, including bestiality, homosexuality, and prostitution. It should be noted that within 20 years, every US state had adopted this code, entirely or partially. Every state’s adoption of the code cited Kinsey’s “reports” as the justification for doing so. The jewish media complex passed off fraudulent claims and serial child rape as “scientific research.” Jewish activist groups (under false “American” names) then called for changes to the laws of gentile nations because of this “research.” When the people refused to comply with this, jews positioned in the judiciary of these nations forcibly rewrote their legal codes. This is how jews craft a narrative.

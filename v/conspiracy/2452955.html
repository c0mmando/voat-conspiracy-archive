            Very telling signs in the marketing, families are rarely represented anymore by any major corporations unless they are of the non-traditional mommy-mommy daddy-daddy or ethnic types.  I used to like apple products as my needs are simple and their devices seemed to be very durable, long lasting products that had few if any problems, also I must mention that I received all of these for free from family members that were upgrading.  But over the last couple years their true colours have shown and I will never support them with an actual purchase as I would have if they had stayed true to their founders ideals.

            All corporations belong to them. Jobs and Wozniak were two simple guys taken hostages by the usual shareholders from the elite. They squeezed Jobs and Wozniak and told them to fuck off from the company. Jobs managed to take control back and was killed. Wozniak is still alive only because he minds his own business and never interferes with Apple real owners.

            Since Steve died, the company has been about nothing but bringing to market his last remaining ideas and wiping out the white males who created it in the first place. The Beats acquisition was the first of many affirmative action… actions and served Apple’s market in no way. Not many remember the cell phone video of the negroid thugs celebrating the “billion dollar deal”, but it should still be somewhere online.

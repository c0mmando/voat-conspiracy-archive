<p>All roads <em>LEAD</em> to Rome.</p>
<p><em>When in ancient Rome, don’t drink as the Romans do. High-born Romans sipped beverages cooked in lead vessels and channeled spring water into their homes through lead pipes (pictured). Some historians argue that lead poisoning plagued the Roman elite with diseases such as gout and hastened the empire\'s fall. Now, a team of archaeologists and scientists has discovered just how contaminated Roman tap water was. The team dredged sediment downstream from Rome in the harbor basin at Portus, a maritime port of imperial Rome, and from a channel connecting the port to the Tiber River. The researchers compared the lead isotopes in their sediment samples with those found in preserved Roman piping to create a historical record of lead pollution flowing from the Roman capital. Tap water from ancient Rome likely contained up to 100 times more lead than local spring water, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</em> <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/scienceshot-did-lead-poisoning-bring-down-ancient-rome">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/04/scienceshot-did-lead-poisoning-bring-down-ancient-rome</a></p>
<p>When did they learn how dangerous lead is? And why did they allow our infrastructure to remain toxic? Gee, why not spend the money on repairing our water trough long ago and keep us from becoming sick and dumb...? </p>
<p>What else has to do with Rome? God Mercury and they want us to worship everything he represents.</p>
<p><em>Mercury (/ˈmɜːrkjʊri/; Latin: Mercurius [mɛrˈkʊ.ri.ʊs] About this sound listen (help·info)) is a major Roman god, being one of the Dii Consentes within the ancient Roman pantheon.

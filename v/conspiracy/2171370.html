If you search for Paddock on this website you get the following.</p>
<p>Organized crime presents a number of problems. Many organized crime families do operate within the family structure and this to an extent creates a less than desirable environment to raise children, organized criminals tend to gear their children into a negative lifestyle. Today\'s organized crime families are different than those that came about in the past. In the past, criminologists would examine La Cosa Nostra or the Italian Mafia, but criminal activity goes well beyond such crime families. Asian and Russian organizations enter the picture in the United States today. Asian gangs have become quite apparent in modern America. They seem to traffic in illegal goods and practices such as heroin, prostitution, and gambling (Bolz, 1995). They also engage in money laundering schemes (Bolz, 1995). This latter focus is at the heart of many crime organizations because they have to cover their tracks and make it appear as if everything they are doing is legal. Therefore, money laundering appears to be universal. Money laundering is also considered to be the key to the Russian Mafia\'s operations (Paddock, 1998).</p>
<p>Seems the Paddock family have ties to Russia.</p>',

            Based on the shady background of Paddock, a connection with organized crime would not surprise me, as I stated in a post on Voat a couple of days ago. It would explain how someone who worked low-level jobs such as mail carrier could end up with a couple of houses and millions of dollars.

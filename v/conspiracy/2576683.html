            William Weilbacher JR  of Ventura County (Camarillo) who has now moved to a nicer, more expensive office in a suburb similar to Bel Air
           </p>
           <p>
            Why let a man who defends people like this pretend he's the hero of the day for 10 obscenely wealthy clients steal all your FEMA funds through an illicit judgement?
           </p>
           <p>
            Look where this ASSHOLE was 5 years ago. From a slumlord plaintiffs and woman beaters lawyer to the savior of the city?
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not fucking think so.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its not just that he sued me while I paid the rent in illegal housing, it is that he is pure evil SCUM. He's also a LANDLORD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make sure you tell everyone that his client VONDA PADILLA (whose husband may be related to Alex Padilla) owns a 501 nonprofit 'helping' victims of DOMESTIC VIOLENCE all throughout Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties.. NAME AND SHAME Yet her personal attorney is a champion for MGTOW and the right for men to BEAT their wives as well as sexually harassing Carolyn Diacos in court, fondly calling her his 'baby attorney' and joking that she is his WIFE (and he has a wife his own age). She is dangerously emaciated and probably coerced by him and will someday come forward, as she's of Middle Eastern descent.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people he represents are career criminals and he needs to be disbarred, go back to TX you fat evil FUCK.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take your fucking TOM HILL Slavery back to where you originated and leave me and California GOP ALONE.

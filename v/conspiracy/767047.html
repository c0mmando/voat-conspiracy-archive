            9/11 taught them some valuable lessons. First and foremost, killing people makes other people ask a lot of questions, and they don't go away easily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember. None of these cases EVER gain any traction because we are asking the perpetrators to investigate themselves.  TRACTION is one of the biggest things they fear.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, no killing unless necessary. But they are still killing anyone caught in the process who is not under their control. Boston bombing: the two Boston FBI agents that weren't FED? -Killed simultaneously in a training accident.. The 38 year old BPD who ran into them? -Brain aneurysm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Zero words from defendant. Brother and cousin killed while in FED FBI custody.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's just plainly shady: Actor's, laughing dad, lottery inconsistencies, mortgage payoffs, FBI stooges like Arrendondo, non-existent medical records, anomalous recovery times, pictures that simply show this was a hoax..
           </p>
           <p>
            Biggest overlooked fact imo:
Pictures clearly showing the bomb backpack came from a CRAFT AGENT and did not match the backpack Tsarnaev was carrying.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a complete mockery of justice. Why? I don't know, but it's nefarious.

            That was pretty good.  I've know a few people on psych drugs and even a few who couldn't take it anymore and quit that ended up improving.  I agree with that Able Child woman.  A lot of our psych institution is too inept to be dealing with children as fast and loose as they do.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for a lot of the media inconsistencies this assumes that the media gives a fuck about their job.  It's sad when an alt news production company can out investigate news organizations 1000 to 1.  News just takes the low hanging fruit reporting off of what ever article they can find.  After a while the system dries up and there is no one actually investigating any thing.  When you have 24 hour news they just start relaying any information they get with no filter and sometimes that's from other media outlets that have misreported.  It's not like the good old days where you had news at a specific time and a certain amount of time to fit the story into so your goal was to produce the highest quality deliverable to fit in that time slot.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the time being I'm going to believe alt news if anything as a protest.  Why should we believe people who invest less into a story than the average internet viewer but just has a bigger mouth.  I wouldn't believe every voat comment I see because of lack of authority, effort, and bias that comes with a voat comment.  Why would I believe a news organization that puts less effort in than anyone trying to understand a subject, has no real authority, and has known bias tied to actual money.  At least I have pretty good reason to believe that the biases of a voater are just personal instead of paid.
           </p>
           <p>
            So that brings us to alt news.  If you are the only one putting in real effort you should be the only one who gets a voice so as far as I'm concerned Sandy Hook didn't happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll say this about alt news too.  Who is an alt news reporter.  He's someone with a youtube.  Takes stories, puts together material, investigates, personally tracks down people to talk to, reads other people's opinions on the matter and digests it, writes a script that tells a story over a period of time, provides context, edits it, delivers it over a 10 minute period in one take, produces graphics and visuals, interacts with viewers, publishes media, deals with licenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's talk about a news room journalist.  Dresses up nice, reads a teleprompter.  One of these things takes a 5th grade education, the other takes serious professionalism.  Any one who says MSM is professional news I laugh.  I know in the case of these guys they had a team but some of these guys are one man shows.  Which of these people should I respect?

            They have made what they did at Sandy Hook legal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the people knew what they did, it is likely people would still decide it was unconscionable fraud and people would go to jail. But ultimately the act of the propaganda itself was "legal".
           </p>
           <p>
            When you get into situations where you actually are murdering for the state - it is very difficult and expensive to find competent people who will do the job. The type of people who will perform such an act are either very dangerous, untrustworthy,or such low IQ that they are incompetent.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when you are dealing with propaganda, you can find "true believers". You can find ex-military who flat out refuse to accept the truth of the world - because that would mean the things they did in the service are worse than meaningless, they are evil. So they will fight the righteous fight and lie and scheme and help propagandists perform their snake dance.
           </p>

            This passed Congress on the day of Sandy Hook, and the Senate the day after:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The most controversial provisions to receive wide attention were contained in subsections 1021–1022 of Title X, Subtitle D, entitled "Counter-Terrorism", authorizing the indefinite military detention of persons the government suspects of involvement in terrorism, including U.S. citizens arrested on American soil. Although the White House[12] and Senate sponsors[13] maintain that the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) already grants presidential authority for indefinite detention, the Act states that Congress "affirms" this authority and makes specific provisions as to the exercise of that authority.[14][15] "

            They have done both with false flag attacks, and depends on the situation.  I think pulling this particular event off would be very difficult to control through arranging an actual shooter that would kill little kids.  Controlling the fake families is easy.  If those families were real, they would have seen immediately that what the authorities were telling them was fishy and would have started digging.  I have no doubt that a group of families bereaved of a child would eventually get to the truth.  The surviving families of 9/11 were so vocal that they forced the 9/11 commission, even though it was a complete farce.  Some mistakes are made out of overconfidence.  I mean if they can get away with 9/11 they must think they can get away with almost anything and the public will believe it.

            Makes sense. The government is playing it smart, they make sure that if they do get caught, at least they didn't kill anyone. Well, not directly. We all know though that the resulting gun control will be direct cause for the murder of millions and the enslavement of 100s of millions.

             It's to their benefit to get caught one day but have a controlled reaction.  Every misdeed government does they would like to one day normalize.  If we find out it was fake what are we going to do?  Storm the white house after Barak is no longer in office and hang the current president.  No, we are going to say that was awful that they did that.  Now they need to be even less careful in the future because any reaction will be even more contained.
            </p>
            <p>
             They only care about controlling the worst possible reaction, succession.  Even isolated rebellion they consider beneficial because that's just one more person they get to put in jail, which they love, or one more citizen hunting trip they get to go on with live ammunition, which is their absolute favorite.

              I do fear for us. I know we're being watched. It's just hard to figure out how to... win. But if it was easy, we would have fought and won long ago. Nothing's easy that's worth it. Luckily it's not impossible.

               You win by being honest. The game is not won in our lifetimes - our spirit wins out.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is not to say you don't do something with this life. But there is so much money and corruption, propped up by so much disinformation - there really isn't a "happy ending" in this life.
              </p>
              <p>
               But most religions have a concept of "heaven and hell" for a reason. Because if you live an honest life and contribute to helping others have more opportunities and better experiences - you will be blessed with more opportunities and better experiences in your spiritual life.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you are a bottom feeder - liar, propagandist, user of men  - your future is hell.

                They normalize dishonesty and sell all honesty and dishonesty as dishonesty to make is seem like there is no other option and to give it as much credibility as any honest statement.  They trick us into thinking more about message than honesty and principles and divide us.  Whether you support a principle or not depends on if it supports the end result you want.  As long as they get the citizens to do that too and expect it from each other, in that type of environment honesty has no power.

                That's why these racists on here are dangerous, and the sjws.  If a cop does something bad and the guy was black we no longer support proper behavior by police.  I've seen attempts at logically grounded justification for a dog eating an infant at the command of an officer because somebody didn't learn English.  Honesty has no power in this environment.

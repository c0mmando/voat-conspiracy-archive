<p>This comment by u/hydroponicfunbags reminded me of the SLC Daycare conspiracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They\'re trying to make other connections to pedophilia rings in government.
Here\'s a for instance... So far in email connections, off the top of my head, we have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/">http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/27/ex-speaker-dennis-hastert-faces-sentencing-chicago/83584440/</a> this Hastert guy who admitted diddling kids when he did work as a teacher, and if you do some Googling you find he did a 3-4 month stint in Japan, with Tony Podesta, John\'s older brother, where they both taught students.
You have the lady trying to steal 33 kids from Haiti.
And of course, you have Epstein.
We should be rounding up all these connections and googling names from email chains in Podesta mail to see if we can tie anymore of their friends to pedophilia or sex trafficking accusations. It\'s not normal to have several people in your social circle involved in this fuckery.
I believe the angle of examining the Amber Alert system equipment, etc, is the same as people going down the trail of the 2 journalists Bing and Bill Clinton went and picked up from North Korea after they got detained as &quot;spies.&quot; The two female journalists were investigating sex trafficking. These trails are being examined because if a sex ring is real, then people in power are probably putting their tendrils in the industry of investigating said rings, so they can continue to tilt the scales and keep their own selves out of any investigations.
Other threads Anon have been going down including examining Visa programs (good cover for human trafficking) and examining movements of shipping containers. They have stumbled upon a few innocuous looking conversations about pushing shipping containers through customs without inspection and avoiding tariffs, etc. Sounds boring until you look at it through the lense of &quot;What if they are trafficking humans?&quot;</p>

<p>Do some diggin on SLC Daycare. It is no daycare. About a year ago conspiracy threads were actually being deleted and people were being threatened to stop digging. I hope the winds have changed a bit. Some people were able get calls answered by a spanish speaking woman and surmised that it was only for poor children and government sponsored. One guy went and parked his car there until a woman and girl came out, then a guy cracked the door 6 inches &quot;what\'s the problem?&quot; and after he saying he was interested in enrolling his child they got hostile and said he needed to leave. One user claimed friends broke into it drunk and found 1 room with a large tv feed from the other large room. More fucked? The whois on the websites were linked to the cities media management head, and quickly went private. The thing that just made me shit my pants is that tons of sketchy container shipments were linked to the place as well. Like entire shipping containers full of plastic jewelry and footballs for a place that only intermittently had any kids, but a constant stream of state exempt licence plates and plumbers/electricians/vans all the time. Lapsed licence in 2006 but fresh paint and shipments? And it is linked to multiple other businesses that are registered as daycares across the nation. I can\'t ignore this one. I know there is something to it. I will try to update with links later.</p>

<a href="https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/">https://www.alertsense.com/company/executive-team/</a>
AlertSense is a company that provides a platform for mass alerts, such as abducted children.
So basically, a woman who served time for trafficking kids in Haiti now sits on the board of a company that serves as the backbone for many local authorities when they want to issue Amber Alerts.
Something doesn\'t add up here.

            The SLC Daycare threads were being purged because of witch hunting and doxing. People were even going and standing outside the place. This whole thing has the vibe of Day-Care Sex-Abuse Histeria. Similar to the McMartin scandal.

            I'm beginning to believe that this Podesta pedophile thing is a slide/distraction tactic thanks to long-time, low-content usernames like yours pushing the narrative.

             While I absolutely agree with you and what it looks like (I am proud of this name), I jumped here after the Pao bullshit and mainly lurk here if reddit angers me. But I am not trying to be a distraction or push a narrative.

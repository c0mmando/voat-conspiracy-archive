<p>The Ambassador of the United States to the Holy See is the official representative of the United States of America to the Holy See, the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church. The official representation began with the formal opening of diplomatic relations with the Holy See by President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II in 1984.  
</p>
<p>Before the establishment of formal diplomatic relations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s Postmaster General James Farley was the first high-ranking government official to normalize relations with the Holy See in 1933.  In addition, Myron Taylor would serve during World War II as an emissary for President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  In 1951, President Harry S. Truman\'s pick of World War II hero Mark W. Clark was defeated. </p>
<p>President Donald Trump nominated her to be the United States Ambassador to the Holy See in May 2017, and the United States Senate confirmed the nomination on October 16, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Gingrich presented her credentials to Pope Francis and officially assumed the duties of United States Ambassador to the Holy See.  She is the 11th U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See since formal relations were established in 1984 under President Ronald Reagan.

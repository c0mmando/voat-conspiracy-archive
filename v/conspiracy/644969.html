<p>If you believe you\'re the subject of a carefully coordinated campaign of bullying that takes the form of stalking, involving large numbers of people you interact with, including complete strangers, neighbours, public service employees, workmates and so on, whose actions take the form of making subtle gestures that you find offensive, uttering keywords or phrases to covertly just letting you know they’re stalking you, e.g. by watching you from a distance or covertly following you around, with the effect of manipulating you, subduing you, making you think you\'re insane and causing extreme distress, this page is for you and trusted members of your family and friends.

<p>There are now hundreds of websites that say gang stalking is a real issue, and they all describe a process that sounds just like the experience of living out a paranoid delusion: Hundreds of perpetrators working for a secret organisation, using &quot;psychotronic&quot; mind control weapons to implant nasty thoughts in your head, working 24/7 to terrorise you. The same websites connect readers to other secret government plots, like spraying harmful chemicals from high flying aircraft (no, those vapour trails are not water) and having the capability to cause earthquakes anywhere in the world using a machine they\'ve built in Alaska.</p>

             Imagine being an articulate speaker with many credentials who opposed "global warming". Freud did this to his patients who challenged his "diagnoses". This is a greatly effective technique if you have someone whose credibility you hope to undermine -- because the logical response to it looks like schizophrenia. If you think it's happening
             <em>
              DO NOT RESPOND
             </em>
             .

             That's a good question, but apparently this is a real thing that has been going on for a long time.  There are enough crazy people around that imagine this happening that when it really happens to someone they are labeled crazy as well.  In this age of computers and other electronics it has become even more insidious.  Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you!  Do some research on the subject and come to your own conclusions.

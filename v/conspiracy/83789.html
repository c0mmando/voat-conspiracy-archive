This is a very serious issue and there are some seriously powerful people involved in this, and if they were to find out who I am, I and my family could be in danger. I will answer questions from you guys if I can, but if I say I can\'t say anything about something, don\'t ask any more about it. I will be intentionally vague for the purpose of my and my family\'s protection, I hope you understand. </p>
<p>Now then... I think it is pretty obvious that Reddit is overrun by shills - that\'s why most of us are here, right? But I don\'t think most people really realize the scope of what is going on. There is an IMMENSE propaganda operation going on, on Reddit, on 4chan, and just about every other major website on the entire English-speaking internet (and I will assume the same goes for non-English websites to some degree as well). But let me start with how I know about this sort of thing. I was hired at what I thought was an ordinary PR firm in an ordinary office building. However, it very quickly became apparent that this was not just some PR or advertising operation. </p>
<p>There were a number of companies that I was instructed to &quot;push&quot; online. Mostly technology and food companies, at first. I would be sent a message that I was to go to Reddit and post a specific picture with a specific title. Sometimes, it was obvious, like a picture of a product front and center with some witty one-liner as the title. In minutes, it would have hundreds of upvotes. Other times, I would be sent a link and told to upvote it - and my station was rigged up to be able to constantly switch accounts and IP addresses, so that I could upvote something dozens of times and no one would be the wiser. I was told this was simply a new method of advertising, and I should just do it and not complain. So I did this for a while, and I knew it was terrible to do, but I needed money and thought it was fairly harmless. </p>
<p>After working there for a while, I started getting new kinds of assignments. I would be told to go to a thread, upvote it, and promote a specific point. Some of the assignments included going into a thread about a military officer seeing his kid for the first time since he started service, upvote it and say something like &quot;Thank you for your service!&quot; or &quot;Aww how precious! Glad the kid finally gets to see their daddy!&quot; Y\'know, stuff like that. Another assignment was to post positive messages about a particular politician. It went from mere harmless advertisement for products, to police, military and politician worship. </p>
<p>After more time, the messages I was being required to push became even more aggressive and politically sensitive. For example, I was being told to mock people who believed that 9/11 was an inside job, mock people who were anti-vaccine, and an oddly huge amount of worship for Israel and demonization of Palestine. This wasn\'t just advertisement anymore. This was pushing political agendas. I was obviously not comfortable with this, but the boss made numerous threats to people in the office to not ask any questions about the content they were &quot;advertising&quot;. </p>
<p>But I was just one person. I was mostly made to visit Reddit, but occasionally I would be instructed to go to other websites as well and post things in comments to news articles, videos, etc. I was never made to go on 4chan but I know that others in my office had been, and were being told to post the same kind of content. </p>
<p>So, what does this all mean? It means that Reddit is pretty much run by shills. I don\'t know if the admins are in on it (though I would venture that at least some of them are), but I know for an absolute fact that there are many, many moderators for many default and popular subs that are without a doubt paid shills. Posting a list would simply take too long, but I assure you, 8 out of 10 default mods are paid shills. If in doubt, look at the list of subs that they moderate. Defaults and popular subs are very heavily monitored by firms like mine (as well as military bases which have the same thing going on), and have wormed their way into moderator positions in order to push certain agendas and disallow discussion of the opposition. If someone moderates more than 1 or 2 default or very popular subs, they are a shill, period. They simply would not be allowed to moderate more or else the agenda could be compromised. </p>
<p>And you will notice that a lot of these subs share moderators, and some of these moderators moderate dozens, if not hundreds of subs. The reason for moderating hundreds isn\'t just to have them, it\'s to prevent something against the agenda from popping up on a minor sub and becoming linked in another sub where they have less control and becoming popular. </p>
<p>Reddit is compromised by shills. Period. And so are 4chan and many other websites. And you know where it\'s coming from? The US government. I know for a fact that this same shit is going down at military bases across the country and who else besides the US government would have the ability to force their soldiers to argue with people on the internet about how the newest obvious false flag attack is totally not an inside job? It\'s government-sponsored propaganda and the masses are buying into the notion that people who call it as much are crazy - which of course, is the plan. I\'ve been told on numerous occasions to insult people for questioning things and not following the status quo. If anybody tells you that there\'s no such thing as shills, or says a line like &quot;When does my check come in the mail then? LOL&quot;, they are a shill and they are being paid to mock you. Do not believe them. Of course, I say this as a shill myself, but at this point I\'m only continuing to do it so I can expose them. </p>
<p>Wrapping up, let me give you a short list of things I\'ve been told to push. This is the sort of thing I\'ve been told to say, so you can assume with almost certainty that everything on this list is in actuality the opposite of the truth. Take that as you will. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>9/11 was not an inside job. Anyone who thinks it was is a crazy &quot;truther&quot; which is a conspiracy theorist which is bad. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandy Hook was not an inside job. Anyone who thinks that it was is a crazy conspiracy theorist who wants to harass the families of dead children. Also, the children in Sandy Hook were definitely real and were killed, that\'s a specific thing I\'ve been told to push. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who demand free speech should be mocked. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guns are bad and anyone who owns a gun is a potential criminal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shills don\'t exist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JIDF does not exist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Israel is our best ally and one of the nicest nations on Earth and Palestine is a filthy hellhole of terrorists that should be wiped off the map. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Police are good. Very good. Only criminals think police are bad. Any cases of police brutality are either false or justified. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Military is good. We should have troops in every country to protect them and give them freedom. Thank you for your service!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Boston Bombing was not an inside job and anyone who thinks otherwise is a crazy conspiracy theorist. The other men with backpacks simply did not exist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russians are bad. Period. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fukushima is perfectly safe. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monsanto\'s products and all GMOs are perfectly safe and anyone who complains about them is an anti-science conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines do not cause autism or any other illness and are perfectly safe and do not need any sort of investigation about them. Anyone who disagrees is a crazy conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>North Korea definitely was behind the Sony hack. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are concerned about privacy or computer security, you must be a terrorist or conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must constantly be reminded of the fact that Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas are the greatest evils in our world. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who thinks ISIS is backed by the US government in any way is a crazy conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who thinks that the ISIS beheading videos were staged is a crazy conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who supports the #GamerGate hashtag is a misogynist and potential rapist. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oddly enough, anyone who does NOT support #GamerGate is a crazy Social Justice Warrior. Yes, both sides are being played. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who wants to go to Voat or any other Reddit-clone is a crazy conspiracy theorist. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just a brief list. I\'ve been told to push dozens of other major news stories and hundreds of miniscule little advertisements. Take all of this as you will, but I assure you that Reddit, 4chan and just about every other big name website on the English-speaking internet is being heavily monitored and will do absolutely anything to stifle dissent. </p>',

             Oddly enough, anyone who does NOT support #GamerGate is a crazy Social Justice Warrior. Yes, both sides are being played.

            <p>
             Anyone who wants to go to Voat or any other Reddit-clone is a crazy conspiracy theorist.

           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           And this is just a brief list. I've been told to push dozens of other major news stories and hundreds of miniscule little advertisements. Take all of this as you will, but I assure you that Reddit, 4chan and just about every other big name website on the English-speaking internet is being heavily monitored and will do absolutely anything to stifle dissent.

            I suspect you are a shill, or an idiot. What's your point in contesting my facts with nonsense?

            Those cameras and shots from ISS are spot on. The camera equipment is state of the art on ISS. The NOW ROUTINE method of cutting feed every time a UFO drop into the ISS camera feed is telling in itself.

            I always feed doubt btw.

            Check out the comments on this Denver news site - there's some user spouting anti-jew stuff while associating the comments with other, more plausible theories.  Not too hard to spot the agent sometimes...

            If you want to see some UFO's just go look at all the times NASA shut off or switched the ISS live feeds.  There's an ancient and advanced satellite in our orbit thats thousands of years old (Black Knight).   Here's some ISS feeds:

            If calling bullshit on this post because of a complete lack of any evidence or proof whatsoever makes me a shill then there's nothing I can do about that. Maybe I'm brainwashed or whatever but my own judgement leads me to believe this is either a troll post or completely made up. It's not like I can just choose to believe this or not. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and people lie on the internet all the time, which is apparently what this is all about.

             Lastly, anyone who is at least 75% cognizant of their surroundings can see there is something VERY wrong with this society right now. Our government is pushing for ultimate control and there doesn't appear to be much to stop it. The false-flags are everywhere and the disinfo, misinfo, and just straight shillery is astounding.

            Exactly my point as well -- I spend very little time there; it's a lot more like high school (or middle school or elementary school for heavens sake) recess, and I prefer voat.co to the blather over at reddit.com -- at least a little more adult.

            Yeah you pretty much described the last 90 years of Public Relations. What's new is that people don't assume public opinion on the Internet is shaped in the same way as other media, because here everyone can look as true or real as you.

              What's new is that people don't assume public opinion on the Internet is shaped in the same way as other media, because here everyone can look as true or real as you.

             No, what's new is that the government of the alleged
             <em>
              land of the free, home of the brave
             </em>
             is actively sabotaging any possible freedom users perceived they had online. Not to mention that it's one thing to write articles in a magazine that are static - its completely different when you have dynamic content voted on in an apparent organic system of approval being manipulated at its core. Whats to stop them from changing votes in an election? If they have their PR game on point, thanks to studies and studies and research like from OP, they've got it in the bag.

              Very true.  Oligarchs completely underestimated the power of the Internet in the 1990's.  I was a web designer back.  Now they realize controlling this new media is not optional.  Letting it run free could literally destroy their sweet rackets.

            That's very telling in itself as to where the crux of this problem lies. This 'Dark government' behind the scenes, upholding whatever 'secret negotiations' were made. Corso didn't lie, and the Washington flyover in 1952 is irrefutable.

            Careful with these posts. You don't have a side now. You can't sit on the fence. Who would you run to? FBI? CIA? You're in the beast now.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're spreading propaganda, with US tax dollars. You'll say it's quasi legal,but technically the biggest question will be whether you are shot or imprisoned. Again, both sides will want this for you. Seriously risky.

            If I were you: document, document document. Get IP's, times, everything you can that identifies their narrative. Find out who's paying the bills, where's the chain of command? Who are the customers? Follow the money.

            Upload your data, share it. Torrent it. Throw it at Anonymous and civil action groups. -That's how you become a hero out of this. Otherwise, like I said. Both sides are going to want to hang you.  If that's too brave for you, then gtfo. Don't support the machinery, -read your Thoreau.

             Why bother collecting all of that info?  You yourself said both sides would want him shot.  If he publishes too much info, the parties in question could identify him and he'll be in hot water.

              The existence of these shill companies/outfits has been confirmed by plenty of people. They've altered the law to make it 'legal'.  They are growing steadily in size and scope.

              Ntrepid is just one of the bigger ones. These operations have been compartmentalized for damage control options beyond deniability.

              Edit: Ntrepd is just another cog in a Big DOD system of quasi-gov't operations.

                Because it does not matter. We know it's happening. Some people who might speak up may read this. They know the general reaction to expect now.. And what's expected of them.

            OP, I don't believe what you say in your post but that doesn't mean the message is wrong. We should all be skeptical of the content we read. It is important to critically think for yourself and not trust everything you read online without carefully analyzing the evidence provided and even going further to see what evidence was left out.

             I've seen the proof myself.  Reddit has had a large number of questionable content appear on the front page.  It forced me to drop a lot of default subs because I was getting sick of the bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some examples of bullshit content:
            </p>
            <p>
             * Drug overdose pictures.  They topped WTF for a whole week.  Most of the top comments were, "No, this is what happens when your dealer cuts it with shitty addititves"
             <br/>
             * K9 puppy in an oversized vest in aww.  Title, "He'll grow into it."  It wasn't cute.  It was just outright propaganda.  I think I saw this twice, at least.
             <br/>
             * DORITOS(tm).  This was a big thing a while back.  I don't see it too much anymore.  This agrees with OP's story about how it started as product marketing and evolved into something.
             <br/>
             * Top post of conspiracy a week ago was an AMA about this guy spouting the most insane shit.  Lots of the posts were people backing him up.  Stuff including "military officers on active space missions" and 60 years of reverse engineering alien tech and more.  Oddly I don't see it now, but it looked like a dedicated attempt to discredit
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             .
             <br/>
             * Very sudden appearance of "Snowden is an active CIA agent" posts after the John Oliver interview.  Or the sudden insurgence of Oklahoma City bombing theories.  Like one post that was near the top it was a grainy picture of a fenced off area with rental trucks with no context.
             <br/>
             * Random video of some black kid ranting at his cell phone that was on videos a week ago.  Basically saying, "Not all cops are bad."  Who fucking cares?  It only was on the front page because it was manipulated to be there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reddit admins cannot possibly be blind to it.  Sure, people like Unidan were able to get away with manipulating the system for a long time to gain amazing exposure and popularity under the Admin's nose, but honestly he was producing quality content.  If anything, the sudden demonization of the man seems suspicious (but I could accept that just being the fickle tide once his methods were exposed).
            </p>
            <p>
             I've seen posts with 2000 upvotes and &lt; 100 comments and that immediately throws up a red flag.  Just looking at these stats alone make the post look suspicious.  And then you look at the post itself and you can see that certain parties benefit by the post content.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now is the worst time to look because it's near the end of the business day, but some suspicious posts on reddit:
             <br/>
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/33gw5v/oh_hell_yeah/">
              https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackPeopleTwitter/comments/33gw5v/oh_hell_yeah/
             </a>
             - Almost 4000 votes and 86 comments from a sub with only 300k users.  Promotes subtle racism. (Actually 3 posts from that sub in top 100.  I never heard of it.)
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/33gomx/cutest_government_worker/">
              https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/33gomx/cutest_government_worker/
             </a>
             - Lots of comments, but it is 8 hours old.  Very much a pro-government picture.  Trying to discount the fact that dog sniffing dogs are very inaccurate and are often used by cops to manufacture probable cause.  In the comments, way, down, is a post 5 hours old with 25 votes with a generic response, but below that is one with 125 votes saying, "I'd let her violate my rights."  Both 5 hours old.  Why is the one with 5x as many votes ranked lower?  Below that, with 400+ votes, "Upvoted because girl".  The only posts challenging the narrative have been suppressed and ones promoting the narrative (or fulling it with mindless chatter) have been boosted.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can find a lot more bullshit on the front page at 10 AM est.  This post has already taken too much time to write, but I believe OP.  Reddit has gone to shit.

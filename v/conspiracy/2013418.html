<p>For whatever the reason/s, chester bennington was murdered and did not hang himself as the current narrative stands. </p>
<p>Chester was a victim of child abuse and molestation from the ages of 7 to 13 years by an older boy. In that time, at 11 years old, his parents divorced with his father winning custody of him. His father worked in the police dept in sexual abuse cases. Child sex abuse comes into Chester\'s life right from the start, he\'s an actual victim of it and no one would know of it until a few interviews popped up in 2011 where he mentioned it. On top of that, his parents\' divorce, the following years as a teenager he would be bullied in school and also go through several very heavy drug habits. In 2011, Chester claimed to be completely sober doesn\'t want to be that person anymore. All of that can be right off Chester\'s wiki page if you care to look, for the most part. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington</a></p>
<p>Why is all that relevant? Because all of that, and Chris Cornell\'s death just 2 months ago in May 17\', and Chester\'s life in general and other things we don\'t know, are all more than enough fuel, possibly even with the help of a small one-time habit binge, to have sent him over and end it. It\'s possible, but not definite. Of course that\'s very possible. Of course it\'s even likely what happened. But that doesn\'t mean you just buy into it so easily either.</p>
<p>&quot;you don\'t know depression, it affects everyone differently&quot;</p>
<p>I understand it. Anyway still, I\'ve read tweets from those around Chester said he was in high spirits and overall good mood before this suddenly happened, other than one article that claimed Mike Shinoda saying chester hasn\'t been the same since Cornell passed earlier in May 2 months prior to chester.  Chester claimed to be sober since 2011, that\'s 6 years of being clean, and he always seem to be just that in his interviews too so there\'s good reason to believe he\'s still been sober. He has 6 children, and is the godfather to Cornell\'s son. Is it really so plausible he\'d decide to up and leave all 7 of them and all the other ones at this moment in his life, after he\'s been through the worst of all his demons already, drug abuses in the past? On Cornell\'s birthday 2 months after Chris &quot;hangs&quot; himself? Again, it\'s possible depression took him in those few minutes, days, weeks, months with or without the help of a binge, he could have still always been battling, but there seems to be other things that could be going on here, and Chester deserves to have them looked into thoroughly. Less than a day later, I\'m reading all these blogs headlining &quot;Linkin Park dead, star\'s drug abuse habits stem from child abuse&quot; yet his drug battles and child abuse isn\'t even news anymore, that was news in 2011, why is that relevant now when it wasn\'t an overdose? when he\'s been clean this long?</p>
<p>I want to reiterate, if anyone has credible links and sources  to help prove or even disprove any claims here, please post them.</p>
<p>Putting the suicide angle aside, there\'s two major other angles to look at. </p>
<p>the obvious one is already being talked about, pedophilia in the music, hollywood, general entertainment industries and companies, the top elites, and a cover-up of it all.</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>In 2014 just 3 years ago, Mike Shinoda and Bill Clinton got together for a recycling project in Haiti, and it\'s strongly believed around these parts that the Clintons are basically a front or directly deeply involved with groups of extremely rich, corrupt, satanic even, pedophile billionaies and others in the highest powers that indulge in and invest in the practice of child molestation, sacrifice, trafficking and harvesting. It\'s also strongly believed here that this is where much of the child trafficking is done, in Haiti, through Clinton\'s own foundation. Understand that by believing one conspiracy, you\'re believing multiple others. Understand your own research must be done and your own conclusion come to. I still believe some very deep investigations are to be had in what\'s going on here and world-wide into child slave trafficking, because unlike all of this speculation, child trafficking actually is a very real thing going on.</p>
<p>I\'ve also seen rumor going around that Cornell came across a \'black book\' of major elite pedophile names, and how this can be playing a big part in what\'s happened to these two, so suddenly, in a 2 month span of each other, kill themselves in the same manner. Again, rumor is the important word here, only worth noting if that can be proven true. I\'ve also seen that Cornell\'s mother believes he wasn\'t suicided, and that someone close to him &quot;betrayed him.&quot; Also only worth noting if that can be proven true, true. </p>
<p>Cornell and Chester both hung themsevles, apparently, and yet Cornell had 9 fractured ribs when he was found. That seems like some heavy damage for a hanging or trying to perform CPR. If anyone would like to link these so it can be confirmed please do. </p>
<p>It\'s also worth mentioning that, if you choose to believe in conspiracies such as what happened to supposed DNC leaker Seth Rich in 2016 and his murder/assassination,  Chester vocally supported Hillary in the 2016 campaign, making it very recently and less than 1 year ago, meaning he could have gotten very close to something he might not should have, or even Mike further back. What that\'s worth is up to you but something seems strange here.</p>
<p>Finally, what is going on with Linkin Park\'s logos in the last decade? If you don\'t understand what that means, and don\'t understand the significance of triangles in the elite rings commonly dubbed &quot;the illumunati&quot; jokingly, especially as it pertains this apparent leaked FBI document of pedophile symbols and logos, then it might not be obvious what\'s being said here. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZAOx8N6.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/ZAOx8N6.jpg</a></p>
<p>Very odd. Yes you can see the vague L.P. letters inside those last 3 logos, but really? Is Mike submitting, or exposing? Mike is directly involved with Haiti relief and the Clintons, and were seeing this uncanny resemblance?  It can understood that the 6 lines around the LP represent the band-members, and Mike simply etched out a line as Chester is gone, but seriously? There is such a thing as too coincidental. Linkin Park only became anti-establishment since during and after minutes to midnight around 2007 and further, for what that\'s worth. What\'s most important is how involved Chester and Mike specifically were getting close to or supporting Clinton from 2014 and as recent as lss than a year ago, 2016.  Follow the timeline here.</p>
<p>People are making connections to Chester and Podesta, albeit very reaching claims such as Chester being Podesta\'s bastard son, but even so forget that part for now. Podesta ran the Clinton campaign of 2016 and going back with them and other billionares as far back as the 90s, probably longer, believed here to be heavily involved in a tightly run child-traffacking and satanic pedo ring through the Clinton foundation. Look into the Podestra brothers, their  distrubing taste in child and sacrificial art selection, and many other very coincidental but very disturbing factors around them and P-gate as a whole. You must research this yourself, or have someone here hand you all the information, or share credible sources that back up these claims here for others to see. If you are too afraid to look and know, you can\'t be fully blamed, but that doesn\'t immdiately disprove it either.</p>
<p>It\'s also worth mentioning Cornell and his wife began running a foundation for children back in 2012. Relevant information, but all I can say about it, whether it was used to actually help children or being used as a front I don\'t know. You must care enough to research.</p>
<p>One last time, if anyone has or finds credible links and sources  to these claims please comment them</p>
<p>A second angle that may be seperate compltely, or tie in together with the first.</p>
<p>What is the second angle?</p>
<p>Warner Bros Records. Possibly on their own or in with accordance to the very top pedophile and again, possibly Satanic elite ring, off\'d Chester specifically, and-or killed off linkin park too at the same time. Why? </p>
<p>Warner Bros is a massive company, you could even rank them in the elite, and we\'ve already said what\'s possibly happening up there. If Chester, or Cornell, or both knew or found out something and were going to come out with it, it could be in both Warner Bros and elite pedo rings very best interests to have him gone.</p>
<p>Now pedophilia aside, If it was solely a Warner Bros murder, They\'re going to profit massively being LP\'s only very major record label, sales are going to skyrocket right now and for a while. It\'s even possible One More Light was their last chance, some at Warner Bros saw it wasn\'t getting the traction they wanted as LP has sort of been in the background for a very long time now. So to get a massive payout and-or in connection with the higher agenda that we already covered, WB had a single or joint decision to have Chester gone, ending LP as a band, and make huge profit off sales while also possibly keeping a secret. </p>
<p>Finally, it\'s also possible that it\'s just true.</p>
<p>All that said, the fact that he had a haunting past could have been bearing on his mind all along even after 6 years of being sober, and a moment of weakness took him, but given everything that\'s said I don\'t believe that. That\'s not to disrespect depression or anyone who suffers from it, I just don\'t believe that\'s what\'s happened here.</p>
<p>Rest in Peace Chester</p>',

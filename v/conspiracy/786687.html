            Just for the record - I'm not a conspiracy theorist.  And you're right - there's anonymity behind the purchase of the ticket when cash is used.  But if the winning number is known or selected before the draw - those people could be just throwing their money away - buying into a lottery that appears legitimate.  Just a thought.  There's always a work around.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out the youtube video of the euro powerball draw - where the final number was displayed before it was drawn...on live TV.  It's possible to control the outcome - so the winning number could be pre-selected.  You don't have to vet for everyone buying a ticket - on the contrary, you could literally choose the one (or few) people who win (or split) the winnings well in advance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just to be clear - I'm spit balling a possibilities...I'm not convinced it's rigged.  I'm not convinced it isn't.

             Of course its rigged, just like a casino.

            <p>
             Yes people truly win loads of cash, but the people who run the powerball and the government which taxes the winnings ALWAYS win. Who cares about paying out the probability based luck winner, when you win each and every time.

            Well, they do know if someone has won after the drawing, so every ticket played gets put into a central database when you buy it. All that they need to do is film the drawing for each one of the numbers, 1-60, then once they know which ticket they want to win, edit the footage so that it looks like 1,2,3,5,8,13 was just magically pulled, and that nobody won. better luck next time chumps. Now, they have security cameras in the stores, cellphone data, and possibly credit-card was used which is enough for the lottery/treasury branch of the government to be collecting all this data, to make sure the correct winner(s) win.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other thing that is not a conspiracy is the pseudo-random number generators they use for quick-picks. If there is one winner, there are multiple winners from QP because the same number pattern gets repeatedly drawn. If there is a winner, they will have to share it with multiple winners including those getting 5/6 numbers and winning like 200k.

            It's not rigged. I just saw a news story that said most of the big lottery winners are now bankrupt. There was a recent winner who bailed her boyfriend out of jail twice for 9 mil. each time. Your not looking hard enough to find the stories of destroyed lives.

             Let's face it - there are probably certain people, that probably shouldn't win that sort of capital. You're probably thinking about someone you know now who you wouldn't trust with it.

            You've strawmanned humanity there. This opinion is useful in your enslavement. Who wouldn't I trust with that kind of money? Oh, the federal government. Apple. GM. Goldman Sachs. The people who already have it. The black Muslim separatist three doors down? The neo-nazi with an undesirable discharge? Fuck... they're honorable compared to the powers that be. Have you
            <a href="http://walmart1percent.org/family/">
             read about the shitty Walton heirs
            </a>
            ? There's no vetting. There is post-factum manipulation. These people can be more easily manipulated than vetted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think banks
            <em>
             don't
            </em>
            have "ties to organized crime...terrorist organizations, or similar"? Do you think nations are any different?
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to believe the lottery was rigged. I knew someone who won about 80 million. It literally ended their family line, with family members killing each other for the money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's what's rigged: that sum will probably be halved. Then taxed. Then kept in a bank, as inert and unliquid as the gold supposedly in Fort Knox, and serving the ends of the bank as the winner racks up DUIs and makes splashy donations to charity.
           </p>
           <p>
            See how long the money would last if the winner tried to take delivery of 1.3B in gold. Or raise an army.
            <em>
             That
            </em>
            would be vetted as it happened, and people would praise the government for responsibly intervening. But really, either of those options seems fine to me...

            Fwiw, there are often multiple winners who split the jackpot.  And I read earlier that if it were a single winner, and he/she chose lump sum payment, the payout would be around $415 million, and the winner would be in the highest tax bracket.

            Nice catch, totes rigged. Now we can watch what kind of winners are announced and compare with your hypothesis. Just a little more red pilling for us I'm sure. That 1984 quote is getting creepier every day.

             I've been waiting for a book to come out, a story on the internet that goes viral at least- that connects with the average person and makes something click in them, giving them, I don't know, awareness of the situation they are in. Maybe prompt them into action with relatable protagonists who start off the same way, become aware, and do something about their situation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I may have been working on something like that for years now. I hope others have been to.

             Going to guess - older/retired...both thrilled that they can now enjoy their retirement without a worry - with more money than they could possibly spend, and will likely donate most of as a result.

              Even if you take away the fact that it's very likely to be rigged, the very concept of it sickens me. The lower class of America spends the highest percentage of their earnings on lottery tickets hoping for a better life. It's a deliberate tool to keep the poor dirt poor and feels very post-dystopian. When you're more likely to die going to buy a ticket for a contest than win the contest, the logical thing to do is realize it's just pure foolishness to enter said contest.

               Should be illegal if gubment actually was for the people. Like predatory lending/credit, ridiculous overdraft fees only crushing the poor. All regressive taxation forms, legal &amp; promoted.

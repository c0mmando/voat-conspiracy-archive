            Best ways to relax? Breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, yoga nidra.

            All back by science. Your solution is confused and wrong. You also don't know anything about mental states. The body is a whole and compartmentalizing leads to problems, if you don't understand that. Compartmentalizing is a tool, not a ground state. Women are bad at it.

            If teachers are acting erratic, it is not your fault, unless you are deliberately provoking an outrage. Which many people learn to do through basic pattern recognition.

            The best way to relax?  Fuck the brains out of some hot chick.  I've found it's FAR easier to relax after that.  Truth.

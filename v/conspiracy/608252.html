            I would actually think there's far less brainwashing now than 30 or 40 years ago.  So he says the average American spends 9 hours a day in front of the TV (includes internet) which is about the same as in the past which was just TV.  However, the information is no longer controlled by 3 or 4 main sources.  It's TV viewers discussing what they are viewing and getting feedback on the internet.  Everything they watch now can be scrutinized and those opinions can be shared among viewers for validity unlike 30 years ago when you just kept the thoughts of "Did I see what I think I saw?" to yourself.

            Of course people realize the media manipulates and distorts perceptions.  You don't think I've noticed how Jewish Hollywood portrays Muslims as terrorists, Germans as evil, and Jews as friendly, funny, lovable people?  The American media tells me Mila Kunis, Scarlett Jo, Natalie Portman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Adam Levine -  all Jewish -  are the sexiest, most attractive people in the world.  Wow, amazing how the 2% of the U.S. population (and far less globally) can dominate the most beautiful people
            <em>
             in the world
            </em>
            lists every year, right?  (BTW, Gal Gadot, another Jew, will be named most beautiful/sexiest woman in the world next year.)  Thank God for the internet which can disprove that hypothesis with a few clicks.  ;)  Now, if someone said Hungarian or Czech women were the most beautiful people in the world, how can anyone dispute that?

             It frustrates me to see the constant controlled conditioning. The only thing I would disagree with your statement is the level of brainwashing.  I think that there are new ways of "dumbing down" the population that I would consider a form of brainwashing.  Our educational system is honestly a joke.  Classes where physical activity and creativity have been cut substantially in our country.  When it comes to education, are we really revealing the truth to our kids?  For example,
             <a href="http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/10/14/8-myths-and-atrocities-about-christopher-columbus-and-columbus-day-151653">
              Christopher Columbus
             </a>
             being depicted as a national hero.  There is a lot of disinformation everywhere, in public, in our school systems, on the television and all over the internet.  This makes it more difficult to find the truth in things.  I figured this was by design .  How else better to confuse people by overloading them with different answers everywhere they look?

             The argument about whether it was worse 30 yrs ago vs now is meaningless.  Its terrible now and your second paragraph does a great job explaining why. That same culture tries to inject falsehoods even into our history books.  Look at WWII - Jews declared war on Germany in the early 30's and Hitler is painted as the aggressor. (To be clear, I dont condone the actions of either party but we're talking about the distortion of perception here). And dont forget how we focus on the people Hitler killed while largely ignoring the significantly larger genocide led by the Bolshevik Jews at the same time.

              About that Holocaust brainwashing, it is real.  Even as 1st grader, I was forced to watch 2 Holocaust movies with the entire school during public assembly.  There's 50 Holocaust museums in the U.S. for an event that occurred in Europe.  I could even understand 50 WW II museums, but it's all about The Chosen People.  And you're right.  More than 12 million non-Jews (mostly Russians and Poles) died during WWII, but we are brainwashed to only remember the inflated 6 million figure.  The small group of people in power determined what we saw and heard for most of our lives until the internet came along, and now, those people are desperately trying to control that too.

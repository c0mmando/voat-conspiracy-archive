            They have email lists and IRC channels, etc where they come up with their talking points which are parroted down their ranks.  They say everybody spam this in your favorite social media site or if you get interviewed by media use them, etc...  they send out alerts and then their uneducated followers repeat the message.  They tell them how to respond to people who ask questions so they don't have to think for themselves.  If they get caught not being able to answer a question they ask a question and then say "burden of proof is on you" so then they can claim victory and leave the conversation.  Other things they say like that are "those things aren't mutually exclusive" and fallicies.. blah blah blah to avoid answering any direct questions that will prove them wrong. It's all psychological manipulation techniques.

            Language is the greatest invention of man but also it's greatest brain washing tool. Learning to think through pictures and abstraction helps breaks this spell and adds to creativity.  This is something Nikola Tesla and all great thinkers understand.

             I've read books by Lakoff and Pinker which suggest specific words conjure up a mental grid that exists in a kind of metaphysical space.
            </p>
            <p>
             They said, the word 'up' would be center and up on this map.  And 'up', it itself, is framed along with concepts such as happiness, good health, joy, exuberance, honesty (on the up and up), and so on. Words like 'down' occupy center-bottom and are framed with concepts like destitute, immoral, depression, loss etc...
            </p>
            <p>
             I am wondering if we are being maniputlated in the same way? Like re-framing trigger words and re-positioning them on our mental maps? So phrases like "Diversity is our Strength" begins to frame strength and diversity together and creates the opposite framework, "Sameness is Weakness".
            </p>
            <p>
             And I would bet there is more to it. Colours, fast cuts, cadences and the like.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like the man said, "All art is propaganda". I thought that was a bit of hyperbole but the more I am exposed, the older I get, the more I see it's true.

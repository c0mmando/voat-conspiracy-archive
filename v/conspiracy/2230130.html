<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Illuminism is the belief that:</p>
<p>1) The universe is based on, and obeys the laws of, math.</p>
<p>2) The Abrahamic god is evil, and Jesus being the son of god was a conspiracy launched in an attempt to return the Davidic bloodline to power.</p>
<p>3) Everyone has the ability to reach &quot;gnosis&quot;, &quot;enlightenment&quot;, etc and become god.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Capitalism and greed run the world right now. The Old World Order is behind this. The Illuminati is staunchly opposed to people being wealthy who haven\'t earned it. They believe you should earn what you actually put in the work for (for example, bankers shouldn\'t be as rich as they are; those who work just as hard or harder will make just as much or more). They are a threat to the OWO, which includes the Rothchilds, Rockefellers, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the things you see about joining the Illuminati to get rich are fake. Real Illuminati believe money should be earned, not given. Celebrities, professional athletes, etc should not be paid millions of dollars a year to do nothing when there are people starving and homeless. No one should be able to get rich by doing nothing while others work hard and suffer everyday. Illuminism stresses the belief in a meritocracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To keep the Illuminati message from being spread, the OWO has twisted things around so far that now people WANT the Old World Order (and the greed and corruption that come with it) and think the Illuminati are bad. People have fallen for it, and are staunchly opposed to a New World Order because they think they have it good as it is. This is how twisted the world\'s minds have become. Why doesn\'t anyone notice how dumb we are getting? We are addicted to our tv\'s, smartphones, etc and our IQ has gone down the drain because of it. For another example, consider fluoride. Dentists insist we need it, yet science has now linked fluoride with lower IQ levels. Don\'t you see? They use technology, propaganda, common core, etc to keep us stupid. Or do you think that\'s just a coincidence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New World Order that the Illuminati envisions is one where people are constantly learning and growing. One where equal work earns equal pay, where there isn\'t such a gross misappropriation of finances (can you believe that 1% of people own half the money in the world?), where there aren\'t people living in palaces while others, no less deserving, live on the streets. The Illuminati does not believe that one\'s bloodline should open any doors for them, either. One should receive only what they themselves earn. That sounds quite different from how things currently are, doesn\'t it? Sounds better though, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fuck what you heard. Time to wake up and fight back against the OWO!</p>',

            Here's the problem with your little John Lennon imaginary NWO: Who decides who works more and who works less? By whom is effort quantified? Do you really think that regulation and taxes, two things that preserve the elite because they apply to everyone except the elite,can be used against them? Governance cannot solve our problem. It can't solve any problem. The only way to solve problems is with war. Not this fake shit they do to exact coups and stagnate economic growth in a region, no, real fucking war. And when we win, and we will, we must make every method they used to control us unlawful. No more regulation. No more fiat currencies. No more handouts in exchange for votes. No more countries importing narcotics to sedate their populace. No more false flag and black bag ops. No more taxes based on income. No more taxes penalizing the creation of jobs. No more of the government deciding what's healthy for us. No more of the government owning the news. No more voluntary surveillance on a network (the internet) designed by the government with the express goal of being easy to listen in on. No more CIA, no more IRS, no more Federal Reserve.

             We started out a little rough there, but I agree. A completely new system is in order. Doesn't that qualify as a New World Order? I understand that the term isn't a popular one, but popularity (or lack thereof) doesn't determine truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for determining who works more, do you see another alternative, or would you rather continue to allow a few to profit off the sweat of many?
            </p>
            <p>
             We need a full-scale revolution.

            Capitalism has never existed in reality, because there has never been a free market. What you see today is basically competitive feudalism. Slavery with extra steps. Capitalism and income based taxation cannot coexist. Capitalism and regulations and entitlements and safety nets, these cannot coexist.

               And I rest my case. I'm not concerned about what hypothetical people on a street corner might think of a sign. I'm more concerned with conversing. Broadening my worldview. Learning new things. Things which you obviously aren't interested in.

             Instead of making a broad, uneducated statement and proving my point, can you elaborate on what part you disagree with?

             And trust me, if you think this is the worst post, you've led a very sheltered life.

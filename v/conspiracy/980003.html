            Totally not letting me post this.. Unles I re-write it because it was copy-pasted.. Nice.
           </p>

            I've traced hydrogen from water for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many murders.
           </p>

            Pioneered by Stanley Meyer. Working patent in 50+ countries. -That requires FUNCTIONAL prototype. Confirmed by UL (underwriters Laboratory), also confirmed by NASA. Stanley entered into contractual negotiations with DoD brass and was about to announce the contract when he fell down dead after a meal with these people uttering his last words; "I was poisoned."
           </p>
           <p>
            His papers and effects were seized IMMEDIATELY thereafter. Including his functional water powered car which he drove some thousand miles without any fill-up. And unlike other inventors, he clearly showed all working parts and shared his working diagrams.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward some years and some of his 'associates' form an alternative energy company called 'Xogen power'. Their results are also confirmed by independent agencies. Xogen is quickly acquired for a huge amount of money from a traded energy company in Canada. -The shareholders are at first ecstatic, then disappointed. The energy company has no intent on monetizing it: they shelf it! Investors sue company. They LOSE! Courts say that company can do whatever they want with it and its an executive board decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            Xogen principles mysteriously disappear or get weird promotions into Canadian government. Yes, several become Canadian government employees.. Very weird.
           </p>
           <p>
            Enter blacklight power: they call themselves white light power or something now.. A 400 million dollar lab in CIA Trenton NJ. The current board of directors are all Illuminanti level players. The original board was just one big WTF: Former GE chairman, Joint chiefs staff, Rothschild banking elites, Naval fleet commanders, -BIG players. Oh, they figured out not just how to do the conversion, but how to get a solid reaction from it. So instead of letting everyone burn water for free, they are gonna make the by-product with a few extra steps and 'let-us' buy it from them.. Oh, now it seems they are going to just make large converters, powered by alittle bit of solar no-less, and sell us the output.. (on their front page).
           </p>
           <p>
            They won't release it yet because it's just so fucking easy to make the original process, that their scheme hinges on over-complicating it. Not to mention the leverage they possess: Oil rich countries are their pawns with this tech.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tesla motors and 100 other entities are gonna figure it all out soon enough though. The hydrogen economy is coming. And guess what: its not going to be a pyramid. Its a level playing field, and that's got them pretty scared. It's no accident Tesla is facing pushback from every extra-legal avenue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Want to duplicate the results? Want free hydrogen? People have figured it out, wasn't that hard. Here ya go:
           </p>
           <p>
            h2o is a simple molecule to split. It has two covalent bonds holding those atoms together. Normally, covalent bonds take a LOT of force to break. In electrolysis for example, more energy is expended in breaking the bond than can be recovered by turning the released hydrogen and oxygen into energy.. But what if you could break the covalent bond for nearly no expenditure?
           </p>
           <p>
            Turns out the reason the covalent bond splits is because of the energy wavelength. Get the right wavelength, it acts like a nice blade, chopping up those bonds. But it requires a good amount of energy to get to there. How did Meyers do it? He found the frequency, 48ish hz range, then he started adding power to the reaction chamber and kept it there without really expending it.
           </p>
           <p>
            To do that, he made the whole chamber a kind of capacitor using resonant chokes, (you can make these for about $3, see youtube). He could just load amps into the chamber, and then he generated the 48ish hz with a simple oscillator and kept resonance. Half his circuit is a Jacobs ladder. The half you don't see on the patents was what he did with his Tesla Bifilar coil. It's centered below the chamber and projects energy upwards.. Yeah we use these devices every day now: remote power charging devices are using the same Tesla bifilar pancakes now to do this. You can actually convert some hotplates to act as one of these with a single wiring alteration. (Even Tesla was fascinated by the weird implications of this coil, a lot of his secret research centered around applications with bifilar coils, even his most iconic picture has him in front of one).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, add a circuit to maintain resonance and you're done: takes a few watts to start up the process then it just makes LOTs of hydrogen. Look at stanleys videos: WOW a lot fo gas! Apparently he freaked out the US patent agent who was aware of just how flammable the stuff is..
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, The h2o2 units you get commercially use the cars output to energize the medium, but it's wasteful and unnecessary compared to the Tesla Bifilar coil.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, try and market this and be sure you have life insurance. That whole theory about how some people hawk BS devices to keep the legitimate ones in the 'quack science' department? Yeah. They exist. Disinformation is a powerful tool. But who thinks they built a $400 million dollar lab following 'quack' science?
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow the money.  And have the balls to post rebuttal before you downvote disturbing facts. I repost with with supporting links for shills sake.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many Private organizations and University science departments have replicated Dr. Mills work? Yeah, and growing..

<p>Back in March of 2015, when the story of Hillary Clinton\'s private email server began to break in the mainstream media, a small clique of long time Clinton associates was identified by Gawker and Pro Publica, in leaked emails from the 2013 Guccifer hacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/private-emails-reveal-ex-clinton-aides-secret-spy-network">https://www.propublica.org/article/private-emails-reveal-ex-clinton-aides-secret-spy-network</a></p>
<p>These men: Sydney Blumenthal, Tyler Drumheller, and Cody Shearer, formed what appeared to be the outline of an off-the-books private intelligence network, which was feeding Hillary Clinton information while she was Secretary of State. Whether or not Clinton was directing this group, or she was merely a client has not yet been determined. But it is clear that the point man was Blumenthal, who was feeding sensitive reports from this crew (Drumheller and Shearer) to Clinton at her then private personal email address.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/blumenthal-didnt-write-any-of-the-libya-intelligence-he-sent-clinton-119081.html">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/blumenthal-didnt-write-any-of-the-libya-intelligence-he-sent-clinton-119081.html</a></p>
<p>The extensive CIA ties of this crew begin to jump out at you immediately. Drumheller was an ex-CIA European division chief at the Directorate of Operations. He was also mixed up in the Iraq &quot;Curveball&quot; yellow-cake uranium debacle, which is an interesting connection to take note of. It also appears that Blumenthal and Drumheller were connected as advisers to Hillary Clinton\'s failed 2008 presidential bid (a connection which will pop up again).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/25/monica-crowley-was-tyler-drumheller-part-of-hillar/?page=all">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/25/monica-crowley-was-tyler-drumheller-part-of-hillar/?page=all</a></p>
<p>Now while one aspect that hasn\'t been looked at yet is the fact that a member of this spy network connected to Hillary WAS handling classified information...Cody Shearer.</p>
<p>Shearer has a very interesting background, including one time in the 1990\'s when he went to Europe and acted as a \'shadow\' agent of the State Department (his brother-in-law is F.O.B. Strobe Talbott), and engaged in unauthorized negotiations with some Serbs, who paid him at least $25,000. The State Department later investigated him, but the report has never been released. Very spooky.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419131/meet-cody-shearer-strangest-character-hillarys-vast-left-wing-conspiracy-brendan">http://www.nationalreview.com/article/419131/meet-cody-shearer-strangest-character-hillarys-vast-left-wing-conspiracy-brendan</a></p>
<p>In a leaked email from the Guccifer archive, dated Jan. 17th 2013, Shearer passed along a document to Sid Blumenthal that, for whatever reason, he had determined was &quot;classified&quot; at that time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.anony.ws/image/DvNN">https://www.anony.ws/image/DvNN</a></p>
<p>That attachment is an itinerary for his brother, Ambassador Derek Shearer and wife Sue Toigo. Derek Shearer is a professor at Occidental College, and Director of their Global Affairs department, “handling the college’s international relations and directing the expansion of its international affairs programs.” Derek Shearer also was an advisor to Hillary’s 2008 failed presidential bid. His wife, Sue Toigo sits on the Board of Overseers at the Columbia Business School of Columbia University.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-shearer/">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-shearer/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=109099694&amp;privcapId=142461261&amp;previousCapId=22779&amp;previousTitle=RRE%20Ventures%20LLC">http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=109099694&amp;privcapId=142461261&amp;previousCapId=22779&amp;previousTitle=RRE%20Ventures%20LLC</a></p>
<p>Now as far as I can tell, Derek Shearer hasn’t been in the Gov’t since the mid-late 1990’s when he was the US diplomat to Finland under Bill Clinton\'s administration. So why, in 2013, would an itinerary for him and his wife be &quot;classified,&quot; if they aren\'t holding gov\'t jobs? Very spooky.</p>
<p>Finally there is one other email worth noting, from Cody Shearer to a group of gentlemen including a Mr. Joe Wilson, Sid Blumenthal, and one Giandomenico Picco, a former UN undersecretary. The email is dated Oct. 19, 2011, and makes mention of &quot;sanitized literature.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.anony.ws/image/DvNk">https://www.anony.ws/image/DvNk</a></p>
<p>That is rather interesting because &quot;sanitizing&quot; documents has a strong link to intelligence and classified information.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_%28classified_information%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_%28classified_information%29</a></p>
<p>Now I fully admit that the &quot;sanitized literature&quot; in question could be anything really. The bits of the conversation we have are being taken completely out of context. But...</p>
<p>I believe there may be reasonable room to speculate, because the Mr. Joe Wilson in question is none other than Joseph C. Wilson IV, retired U.S. Ambassador and husband of Valerie Plame Wilson, the famous &quot;outed&quot; CIA agent. Also note that the Wilson\'s feature prominently in the yellow-cake uranium debacle. Very spooky.</p>

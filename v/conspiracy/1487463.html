<p>I saw your post about Trumps cabinet picks on Reddit just now. I think we really need to hear your thoughts on the Trump cabinet picks.</p>
<p>I was very frustrated when the transition team for the FCC included anti-net-neutrality guys. But I don\'t have the same doom &amp; gloom about his other picks, because I am a pragmatist. We need people who get things done, and who work in international arenas they will be operating in. But you mentioned how Mnuchin is a good pick if you\'re expecting the Petrodollar to collapse.. Well here I won\'t paraphrase; here\'s the post:</p>
<p>&quot;cabinet picks. Basically, he was saying they are good picks in terms of &quot;realism&quot; for what\'s coming.</p>
<p>Mnuchin: In anticipation of the bankruptcy of the US government, you need a liquidator in chief. I have been anticipating the collapse of the petrodollar and the shift to the SDR as the world\'s reserve currency (regardless of who won), so this actually makes some sense.</p>
<p>Tillerson: US foreign policy has been centered on oil for decades, and the idea here is you need the right person to shift the axis of oil away from reliance on Saudi. The problem for his opponents is they will attack him for being a servant of oil interests, totally ignoring that that is and has been the case for a long time. If it means the US getting the fuck out of the Middle East, great.</p>
<p>While this gives a positive spin of &quot;realism&quot; on some dark looking choices, there still seems cause for concern. I have less to say about the other picks. Then again, we all may be surprised by what happens next—including the people in Trump\'s White House.&quot;</p>
<p>I also like this:</p>
<p>&quot;I understand your anxiety, because the MSM is still marching for Hillary at full tilt, but key parts of the establishment have settled in Trump\'s corner, which will put the kibosh on these desperate flailings from Hillary\'s faction. In case you haven\'t noticed, the MIC, the FBI, and probably the NSA have lined up behind Trump. I don\'t know if it was one specific thing, but I think these particular echelons of power barfed at the prospect of following through with a Hillary agenda.</p>
<p>I\'m not saying that\'s the end of it, because clearly team Hillary is still fighting. But in the end, with the MIC and the militias on his side, the Donald holds the Trump card. (sorry)&quot;</p>',

            Sadly my friend nothing will change.

            Trump is a plant. We live inside a movie. The script is everywhere and our actions are all that matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I could guess I would say trump is just a stepping stone, clinton will end up stealing it in the end, or the NWO will be getting pushed hard in the coming 4 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say there is no such thing as a non hostile take over so my suggestion is to inform all and just keep living life. Don't inform about terrible stuff just that the world is a joke and we can make it better infinitely if we only gave ourselves the power.

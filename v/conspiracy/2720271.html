Through a deep wiki-hole, I stumbled on the Wikipedia page about this particular case, which then lead me to the page on Ted Gunderson, and ultimately I was convinced. I believe the initial wiki-hole I fell through that lead me here started at MK-Ultra, as it was theorized MK-Ultra had something to do with Jeffrey MacDonald. Don\'t quote me on that, though.

<p>Now to the point of this post - thinking about the best way to redpill others, I went back to the Jeffrey MacDonald page to re-read what had originally changed my perspective, and lo and behold, the conspiracy section is nowhere to be found! It briefly talks about the claim the defense made in court, but Ted Gunderson is no longer referenced anywhere. Which is a huge omission, given that he personally took on this guys case for like two decades until his own death! The page has definitely been scrubbed, which of course we all know is likely to happen, but is particularly dangerous as the general public still considers Wikipedia to be the new, authoritative Encyclopedia, replacing the Encyclopedia Britannica. We used to be able to find conspiracy evidence in publicly trusted sources such as Wikipedia, but it\'s all slowly being shoved down the memory hole and relegated to fringe alternative media sources that the public largely distrusts.</p>
<p>It may help our cause and aid in redpilling the masses to document this sort of thing and help discredit Wikipedia in the face of the public.</p>',

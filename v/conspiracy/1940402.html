            I don't think it was done to make it legit to the US. I think it was done to kill off the indifferent people, and to remove the barriers. The whole region is slowly destabilizing, because their stability was artificial. ISIS is a tool used to both destabilize the region, kill off large numbers of the population, force people to obey America or else, and to motivate the kurds to make their own nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the kurds can not find that motivation, then there is no point in building an artificial nation state. Just let the region be a lawless hell and eventually the population will hit the natural stable level.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is population control on top of nation building. After all, how do you get rid of such a large inbred population?

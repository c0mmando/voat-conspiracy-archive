            Here is the updated version of the message I will now be spreading all over VOAT. GOD SPEED AND GOD BLESS AMERICA.
           </p>
           <p>
            -
           </p>
           <p>
            The amount of deep state, Q hating, Trump hating shills in Qboards and everywhere is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's such a desperation to discredit ANY SMALLEST PIECE OF TRUTH! NO MATTER HOW SMALL, EVEN A CRUMB OF TRUTH IS LIKE SUNLIGHT TO A VAMPIRE TO THEM!
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY ATTACK 200% OF ALL TRUTH ACROSS ALL TOPICS, NO EXCEPTIONS.
           </p>
           <p>
            These shills are spreading concern shilling, depression shilling, defeatism shilling, and just over all bad vibes because they think that if they make us get sad that we'll all give up and go home and the great awakening will just get up and walk away FUCKING LOL
           </p>
           <p>
            Attention shills. All true Q followers are voting for Trump in 2020. You didn't change one single vote. You're ALL useless. Tell your handlers you failed, no holiday bonus for you!
           </p>
           <p>
            YOU SHILLS WILL NOT DIVIDE US!
           </p>
           <p>

            Shills are abusing Voats voting system! Nothing stops them from downvoating you to hell and when you run out of points, you get limited. Can't make posts, threads, or even voat others!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have determined using FACTS, that this voting system is not viable or sustainable because there are NO CHECKS AND BALANCES! There is no way to protect yourself against corrupt elements downvoating you to hell regardless of the quality of your post, but simply because they just don't like you! There is nothing that can be done to stop this, and horrible shills and trolls run free literally disabling peoples accounts by removing all their points with a single click!
           </p>
           <p>
            I swear to God these voting systems are cancer. This is why people use chans to post because you don't actually get censored for exercising your free speech. Post funny videos in a funny board and a bunch of arsebliterated lemon sucking monsters downvoat me to hell, which then lowers my points to absolute hell, and now I can't voat anyone else. So let me get this straight, someone, anyone at all can downvoat me to hell, even for completely dishonest reasons, and just because of that they can take my voice away? This is some real communist bullshit!
           </p>
           <p>
            This website is destined to fail because it puts unlimited power into anyones hands, but especially those who are the most willing to abuse it. There is no way to defend yourself against floods of rage mobs of shills with an agenda, all working together to cause harm to censor accounts that don't align with their political agenda. If you support Trump, Q, America, you're a target to them. It's absolutely disgusting how this is simply allowed to happen. How can a site grow and even maintain a level of posters if everyone is driven away by a mafia of downvoat mob shills faster than they can join?

             Some have suggested I use bots to save myself, but I don't think it's right to use bots or other dishonest methods to prop myself up. Then I would be just as dishonest as the people who are trying to hurt me and censor me and destroy freedom of speech. I feel that this is now the sword I must metaphorically die upon if there is to be a change, a true revolution on voat. I will be spreading this message far and wide until change happens, or until my account is destroyed for simply telling the truth way too much. God Speed.

            Was that supposed to be some kind of defense mechanism designed to make me look bad somehow? Because it doesn't. You know what would? An intelligent response addressing the factual content of my post. But that isn't possible, because everything I said is true and you know it.

            But you don't like hearing it, so you react by name calling or using semantic stop-sign themed buzzwords in an attempt to pathetically censor any logical debate or discussion or response that could have possibly come out from all of this, because

I’ve abstained from posting on social media, and from revealing my intentions in real life to those I interact with on a daily basis. The only people who know what I’ve been working on are a small circle of trusted researchers. <a href="https://voat.co/user/Honeybee_">@Honeybee_</a> can vouch for me.</p>
<p>The reason for my posting and the breaking of my vow of silence today, is because I believe that there may be a potential red team scenario playing out in front of us. For those who don\'t know what a red team is, the below quotes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">from Wikipedia</a>) provide an adequate definition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A red team or the Red Team is an independent group that challenges an organization to improve its effectiveness. It is particularly effective in organizations with strong cultures and fixed ways of approaching problems. The United States intelligence community (military and civilian) has red teams that explore alternative futures and write articles as if they were foreign world leaders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In wargaming, the opposing force (or OPFOR) in a simulated military conflict may be referred to as a red cell (a very narrow form of Red Teaming) and may also engage in red team activity. The key theme is that the aggressor is composed of various threat actors, equipment and techniques that are at least partially unknown by the defenders. The red cell challenges the operations planning by playing the role of a thinking enemy. In United States war-gaming simulations, the U.S. force is always the Blue Team and the opposing force is always the Red Team. When applied to intelligence work, red-teaming is sometimes called alternative analysis.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, the highest levels of the Swamp (deep state/Illuminati/etc) have undoubtedly been exploring alternate timelines in hopes of discovering the most effective method for regaining control over an increasingly agitated and non-compliant populace.</p>
<p>I don’t deal in predictions, only probabilities. If nothing comes of all this alien/Pleiadian/disclosure hype, I’ll continue forward just as I have been. But if this is indeed a red team plan unfolding in front us, we may be looking at an attempt by the shadow government to regain their grip on the power and influence they’ve been rapidly losing over the last 18 months. The conventional strongholds of global control are taking on water, and one thing is clear—they won’t go down without a fight. They will do anything to keep pedogate from seeing the full light of day, which is why this possible attempt to hijack the narrative has me so concerned.</p>
<p>What pushed me over the edge was <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/917869274387173376">this tweet from John Podesta</a> a few days ago. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2015/02/13/obama-aide-john-podesta-says-biggest-failure-was-not-securing-the-disclosure-of-ufo-files/?utm_term=.4f3369a68e10">Podesta’s stance on alien disclosure</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/10/12/blink-182-tom-delonge-john-podesta-ufos-wikileaks-hillary-clinton-campaign/91939392/">his relationship with Tom Delonge</a> has been common knowledge for some time now. What convinced me that it was time to release this information publicly though was Delonge’s promotion of the <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1615320648490268&amp;id=161055970583417&amp;_rdr">To The Stars Academy</a>, along with Podesta’s <a href="https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/917869274387173376">extremely visible support of the organization</a>. Combined with the email primers (linked at the bottom of the post) I have been disseminating to my team over the course of the last month, these are at the very least coincidences worth taking note of. Some would call them synchronicities.</p>
<p>Delonge also recently <a href="https://worldtruth.tv/blink-182-singer-tom-delonge-exposes-pedophile-ring-leading-to-arrests/">helped take down a pedophile ring</a>, so he has “street cred” at this point when claiming to be working with the “good guys”.</p>
<p>On the same day that the Huffington Post announced <a href="https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_59dc1230e4b0b48cd8e0a5c7/amp">Delonge’s intention to disclose the existence of aliens</a>, David Wilcock happened to release a <a href="https://divinecosmos.com/start-here/davids-blog/1220-vegas-meta-analysis">four-part meta-analysis of the Las Vegas massacre</a> that seamlessly tied together Delonge’s announcement, the mass shooting itself, the recent exposure of Hollywood’s filth, and the coming alien disclosure to humanity. You can’t make this stuff up. Slightly strange that such an in-depth and lengthy article was ready to be posted so close to the time that Delonge’s announcement came out. It almost seems coordinated.</p>
<p>Wilcock postulates that Hollywood\'s currently crumbling credibility may be an act of the a group of &quot;off-world entities&quot; known as \'The Resistance\' or \'Blue Avians\'. While I am always ecstatic to see human suffering alleviated, this feels almost too convenient, all things considered.</p>
<p>On Wilcock’s show, ‘Cosmic Disclosure’, the narrative pitched is that our planet is being protected by a group of alien entities known as the &quot;Blue Avians”. These entities are resisting the “Cabal” (Wilcock’s term for the shadow government/Illuminati/etc). According to Wilcock, when these entities finally intervene publicly there will be mass arrests, justice will be served, and a new golden age of humanity will be ushered in.</p>
<p>Hollywood\'s entire purpose is to tell stories by acting them out via movies and television. Could this be the grandest production of them all? Offer up an extremely visible slice of Americana as a sacrificial lamb, in hopes that the more egregious atrocities of the ruling elite will be ignored? I\'ll be convinced when Hollywood AND the rulers of this world are exposed for their crimes against humanity. Color me skeptical until I see state actors in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Wilcock’s primary source is Corey Goode, who claims to be a former astronaut in the secret space program. Delonge is working with US government insiders who claim to have worked with the secret space program. After all, To The Stars Academy’s stated goal is to use the entertainment industry to provide “soft disclosure” to the masses, before eventually dropping the major bombshells publicly.</p>
<p>Lastly, Wilcock’s four-part article asserts that the Cabal botched the Las Vegas massacre so badly that the Blue Avians may be forced to intervene. In layman’s terms, the Blue Avians may be forced to reveal themselves to humanity and step in to make arrests, serve justice, and usher in a new golden age of humanity.</p>

<p>A Jew should and must make a false oath when the Goyim asks if our books contain anything against them.</p>
<p>Szaaloth-Utszabot, The Book of Jore Dia 17</p>
<p>We beg Thee, O Lord, indict Thy wrath on the nations not believing in Thee, and not calling on Thy name. Let down Thy wrath on them and inflict them with Thy wrath. Drive them away in Thy wrath and crush them into pieces. Take away, O Lord, all bone from them. In a moment indict all disbelievers. Destroy in a moment all foes of Thy nation.

<p>Prayer said on the eve of Passover  (Pranajtis: Christianus in Talmudae Judeorum, quotations from: Synagoga Judaica)</p>
<p>The Feast of Tabernacles is the period when Israel triumphs over the other people of the world. That is why during this feast we seize the loulab and carry it as a trophy to show that we have conquered all other peoples, known as &quot;populace&quot;...</p>
<p>Zohar, Toldoth Noah 63b</p>
<p>When the Messiah comes every Jew will have 2800 slaves.</p>
<p>Simeon Haddarsen, fol. 56-D</p>
<p>Resh Lakish said: He who is observant of fringes will be privileged to be served by two thousand eight hundred slaves, for it is said, Thus saith the Lord of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, etc.</p>
<p>Mas. Shabbath 31b</p>
<p>On the house of the Goy [Goy means unclean, and is the disparaging term for a non-Jew] one looks as on the fold of cattle.</p>
<p>Tosefta, Tractate Erubin VIII</p>
<p>When a Jew has a Gentile in his clutches, another Jew may go to the same Gentile, lend him money and in turn deceive him, so that the Gentile shall be ruined. For the property of a Gentile, according to our law, belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has full right to seize it.</p>
<p>Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 156</p>
<p>If it can be proven that someone has given the money of Israelites to the Goyim, a way must be found after prudent consideration to wipe him off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Choschen Hamm 388, 15</p>
<p>Happy will be the lost of Israel, whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has chosen from amongst the Goyim, of whom the Scriptures say: &quot;Their work is but vanity, it is an illusion at which we must laugh; they will all perish when God visits them in His wrath.&quot; At the moment when the Holy One, blessed be He, will exterminate all the Goyim of the world, Israel alone will subsist, even as it is written: &quot;The Lord alone will appear great on that day!...</p>
<p>Zohar, Vayshlah 177b</p>
<p>That the Jewish nation is the only nation selected by God, while all the remaining ones are contemptible and hateful.</p>
<p>That all property of other nations belongs to the Jewish nation, which consequently is entitled to seize upon it without any scruples. An orthodox Jew is not bound to observe principles of morality towards people of other tribes. He may act contrary to morality, if profitable to himself or to Jews in general.</p>
<p>A Jew may rob a Goy, he may cheat him over a bill, which should not be perceived by him, otherwise the name of God would become dishonoured.</p>

            Is this a bad translation? A -th at the end of a word indicates either an archaic source, or a bad translation. Also, misspelling yoreh deah as jore dia does not inspire confidence.

             when a jew has you trapped into a bad deal, another jew may give you money to "help", but you will only be financially ruined. Ex: High Cost of Tuituion, other jews give you money, but all you got was a lib arts, now you are ruined. Your property, according to long nose law is the property of the first jew to find it.

            Talmud does not = Mikra. Just bc people wrote some heretical stuff doesnt mean true followers believe it. It would be like saying that all christians are Mormons bc joseph smith wrote some stuff based on the bible. You cant lump all of christendom with joseph smith/mormons. Alot of that stuff posted is kaballah which is a super small sect.

             The peaceful majority has been proven irrelevant in history time and time again. It only takes a small group of dedicated people to change the world. The same quote (paraphrased) also applies to those who wish to nefarious deeds as well. Whether we are talking Islam, Zionism, The Vatican or who or whatever. The disgusting texts such as these is believed by enough people who use them to justify "their" cause and if we just turn a blind eye to it we shall be forced to confront it with force eventually. People need to wake up and start seeing how evil some aspects of these religions are and stop the infiltration in the west otherwise we will have a second crusades/holocaust for sure.

            If there was ever greater evidence that Jews should jump ship and switch sides, that's it right there. It's like a dude sitting on the Titanic and watching the Iceberg in slow motion.

             There are sources following each quote, but I do not understand most. Will see what I can do. I have various rabbi quotes, mostly zionist, on a hard drive but have to sort them out. If I find them they are excellently sourced. Thanks for the feedback all.

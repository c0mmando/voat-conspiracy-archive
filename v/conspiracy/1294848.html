            I first heard of the smoke machine during a lecture by the author of
            <a href="https://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com/2016/04/proof-boston-marathon-bombing-was-faked.html?m=1">
             this article
            </a>
            who said he had spoken to a film director about the BMB, who told him that a.) that was a smoke machine and b.) the event was an example of hyper-realistic film, which is made to be gory and perhaps prepare new recruits to military or law enforcement for seeing gruesome real-life scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes sense considering they used amputee actors which are often employed for similar training exercises, and the fact that

            The device being removed is a studio grade smoke machine.

           <p>
            The more I look at it, the Boston bombing is the false flag event that you should be able to convince those who are most asleep of. It features smoke machines, fake blood, physical impossibilities, crisis actors, and generally sloppy staging.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people don't know we have reports of (and video of!) police bullhorn calling out before the bombing "This is a drill! This is a drill!" We have tweets from the BPD saying there will be a drill activity by the bomb squad. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous.

             Do you have a good place to share where this information is all together? Maybe I spent too much time looking at Connecticut and not enough time on this event.

              I kinda of need better proof as well.   This could have been for winners of the race and taking them away from the scene would be generally a smart idea as they are explosives as well.

              If you can get past the emotional barricade that keeps almost everyone from questioning Sandy Hook, this one should be no problem for you.  My favorite is Jim Fetzer's "update"

              but some people don't like him, idk.
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically your common sense and scientific knowledge should be enough to do the trick. We see pictures of a guy's leg blown off, no blood anywhere, the same guy being wheeled away when he would have been dead within 2 minutes of the blast, showing up 19 days later at a hockey game with a different type of injury, then again at a baseball game as a different person....
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the Tsarnaev brothers is taken into custody, there's video of this, then later it is said that he was shot by police and run over with an SUV by the other brother. So there is also a picture of his dead body.
             </p>
             <p>
              Later, when the younger brother Dzhokhar is apprehended, they immediately pounce on him and perform some weird mini-operation on his throat, this is on video as well, then later it is said that he can't testify because he got a throat injury. How convenient.  One of the guys the FBI interviewed was a friend of the brothers and was shot by the feds when he was said to have resisted. The list goes on and on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course the most obvious is what you're seeing now in the Chelsea fake bomb: no pictures of ambulances, no influx of EMTs to the scene -- you can't divert genuine medical resources for a fake event.  Over 250 people were said to have been injured in Boston yet no pictures show more than the same 10-12 people at any time. And no pictures taken in Chelsea last night except for the stupid trash can? Give me a break.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I can't find video of the arrest of Dzhokhar but there is a photo of him before the arrest with no throat wound, and video of the Boston SWAT team describing his throat wound as a slice wound rather than a bullet wound which was the official report. So he was likely arrested then hastily had his throat cut so he literally couldn't talk.

               Although... I can admit to being one of those folks who think Fetzer is, umm, a bit much. Isn't he a no-planer? I mean, the theory is interesting and I've explored it, but it's just too complex to make the cut for me to consider it a rational conclusion.

                The only disclaimer I have about Fetzer is that ultimately you truly can't know who to trust, which is unfortunate, but in the truth movement accusations are thrown around all the time about people working for the CIA etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                The no plane theory is interesting. I think it's pretty obvious a plane did not hit the Pentagon. As for the other buildings, I can't explain the anomaly of the plane melting through the south tower. So I really don't know. I only just started seriously studying 9/11 this year.
               </p>
               <p>
                But re: Boston, forget I even mentioned Fetzer and just look at some of the other stuff. Search for Carlos Arrodondo for example, the crisis actor with the cowboy hat. There's lots of good content about this. As I said, it was announced that a bomb drill was happening nearby so it doesn't get much more clear than that.

                  I don't really get that piece. For one his medical analysis is terrible and he obviously has no idea what he's talking about regarding the blood or a leg injury. Also at the scene we are presented is a black lady that looks relatively unharmed and is loaded onto a stretcher while the guy who presumably got his leg blown off is pushed in a wheelchair.  Now I do have enough medical experience to say that he would have been dead from his injury within minutes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the whole point is that when he makes other appearances it's not even him. The guy at the Boston bruins game is an Iraq veteran named Vogt who is missing a finger. And the guy at the Red Sox game looks to be a third person with a different leg injury. And Carlos Arrodondo was 100% a crisis actor too.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't know what he's trying to say about "using crisis actors at a real bombing." It wasn't a real bombing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It's kind of weird because it sounds like he's saying it was fake but ignores the most obvious evidence it was. I mean there's plenty of other evidence too. The bullhorn announcement thing like you said, I have also thought the accent is weird. But, assuming it is in English, that's what it most be saying. And the tweet says there will be a controlled explosion across from the library and that's exactly where the bomb was.

                    Well at the bombing like 250 people were said to be injured but when you look at all the photos it's the same 10 or so people. You can even see the badges of some of the people involved in these drills.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think setting a real explosion off is a much less reliable way to go about it, because you can't stage the exact optics like the sight of a Hispanic hero pushing a guy with no leg to safety in a wheelchair.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There's a website called amputeesinhollywood.com that supplies amputee crisis actors for military drills and other fake scenarios.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That guy supposedly showed up at a hockey game like 19 days after the bombing when he would have been making a recovery for months.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think Occam's razor is a good way to go but to apply it you have to think, is it more believable that this guy would have a leg (both legs) blown off, not bleed, that the wound would look fake compared with real pictures of the same injury, then survive after bleeding out for like 5 minutes? Or would he just die in like 2 minutes? Rolling him away upright in a wheelchair would be the last nail in his coffin.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There are so many other aspects we could talk about besides the fake photos though. Like how crazy it is that the older brother was taken into custody then said to have been killed. Or that Dzhokhar was said to have scratched a confession in the side of the boat he was hiding in. Well it was a fiberglass boat and it requires a special implement to write on it. Since the odds of him having that implement at the time and being able to write in perfectly straight lines are about 0, it's pretty clear that at least that part of the story is fake. So eventually all these little holes just make the whole thing come apart.

                 So far the claims from Fetzer's vid aren't adding up to anything, and hurting whatever other evidence may exist (sadly).

                 No-plane theory is interesting but doesn't hold water for NYC. They were planes, no doubt. The plane 'melting through' is something to ponder for amusement, but really it just distracts from the suspension of disbelief it takes for the two buildings (and another) crashing down within their own footprints within an hour of the planes crashing into them.

                 As for the pentagon, I'm not so sure. And the crash site in PA doesn't look like any plane crash I've ever seen.

                 I haven't found evidence of the announced bomb drill yet beyond the video footage with the subtitles. I can't place the accent there, it sounds very strange. The tweet 'evidence' is complete BS and doesn't make any sense, in my opinion. I'll look up Carlos and see what I can see.

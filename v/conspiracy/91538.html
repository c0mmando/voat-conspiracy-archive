             Tamils who committed atrocity in Sri Lanka have been granted safe haven in Australia, where they are causing the same trouble that they caused there and are blaming inherent racism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tamil woman behind the counter in the supermarket deli breathes heavily into the bag of fish, a couple flecks of spittle land in the bag, she wraps it up throws it onto the counter and stalks off.
            </p>
            <p>
             Next time at the same counter after I had made a complaint re the spitting incident, a male Tamil took a knife from a rack and plunged it into a stack of cardboard boxes .. I interpreted his actions as a death threat.

            <p>
             Giving comfort and financial assistance to terrorists is a capital offense .. all Tamil elements who are found to have donated funds or to have been members of Tamil terrorist groups.

            <p>
             Are deemed terrorists and will suffer the same capital fate as the Jews - only after fair trials similarly in duly appointed Australian courts!

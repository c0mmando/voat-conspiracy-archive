<p>Hola allows other people to use your IP. They can use this to DDOS sites. Stamping out the offending IPs is something of a fools errand because you\'re getting a randomized swath of IPs.

           So far, there seem to be two hits: VOAT and 8Chan. I wonder if there are more. Would it be possible to cobble together an "axis of lulz"? If we're the "target", we're someone's enemy. Who hates us? Why would Hola do this this to the netizens? In other words, who does #2 work for? The creators of Hola are
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hola_(VPN)">

            ..because it is.  We're in chaos theory.  No current model can predict the coming changes, there are too many 'Black Swans' to account for that we aren't even aware of.

            We've already passed several 'tipping points', of which there is no return.  The catastrophic weather we're experiencing will only increase in magnitude and frequency.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're best bet is to prepare for any eventuality, whether it be war or nature.  Get food (buy or grow), lots of it.  Get water and purifying options (filters etc).  Get a go-pack (containing whatever you believe is important; two-way radios, rope, compass, knife, shovel, canteen, matches, tarps, MRE or dried trail mix, radiation suit, gas mask, eye protection, collapsible fishing poles etc).  Practice, once a month, camping for a few days and see how well you do.  Learn your weaknesses.  Adapt.  Survive.

            It's fucking weird that all this has turned into a giant media circus out of fucking nowhere. I'm fed up with hearing about this Kardashian clan lady man who pretty much just got surgery to look like a woman but didn't have the guts to actually cut his dick off. I'm traveling Central America right now and overheard an American girl talking to one of the hostel owners when I was in Guatemala. She had so much praise to sing for Catelyn Jenner then the Guatemalan man who runs the hostel brought up Chelsea manning and she had no fucking idea who she was.

            I don't hate trannies. In fact, I don't think about them much, except when pondering why people say "chicks with dicks" rather than "dudes with boobs". I do, however, think this is an indicator of the populace's acceptance of an external reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trans people hate the "what next" argument, but... what next? Declaring a pine forest to be a stand of hickories? Insisting that the US is solvent? That FR notes have some intrinsic value rather than an implied debt? Yeah, some people have weird genitals, weird hormone balances, but this is far from a cultural phenomenon. We don't say "people have tails" -- although some do. We haven't made special acceptance programs for people with parasitic twins. Moreover, the definition of the imagined gender depends on feelings and opinions. Yet when a psychiatric patient is upset about some powerful abstraction (the gubmint, the jooz, Mr. Charlie) these same enablers are willing to say that these opinions and feelings are displacement -- and stem from childhood anxieties, or material concerns.
           </p>
           <p>
            The emperor has no clothes. Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner is not "really" a woman. (Oddly, that use of "really" is nearly an antonym for its meaning.) Bruce might want to cut his junk off, get some implants, dress fancy and change his name, but... would he have to do that if he was "really" a woman?
           </p>
           <p>
            Where does it come from? I think a large portion of humanity has begun to think more about other people, networks, cultural values and social norms than they have about external reality. Their jobs are essentially the schmatta-men of the emperor. Oddly, external realities -- hot in the summer, water is cold, cow is dead -- rarely have an effect of their life because they're sufficiently enmeshed in the social web and carry sufficient weight that the landscape can shift with their moods.
           </p>

            We used to call the people who enable this "flatterers" but we no longer have a head of state who will listen to flattering reports that his ragtag navy is the best in the Baltic (which means shit in the Atlantic). It's hard to tell if this reality-creep has poisoned your own mind. Probably, it has. It's probably identifiable in the things that make you really angry for no clear reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Were they "born this way"? Well, they were born. They had worries and doubts and skepticisms. They were also born into a position where those vague mental activities might be indulged. What's really weird to me (and I see it was mentioned in the downvoated comments): cultures with a "third gender" don't want any part of this, for the most part. I see some overlap forming in richer Asian countries prone to the same cultural flattery, but in other places the opposition can be quite strong. LadyBoys are supposed to have cocks. Or they give the game up when it becomes harder to pull off, etc. But these details vary by culture. What's weird to me is the Western notion that external reality begins in the opinions of the subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could think of explanations, but they'd tend metaphysical and weird and I'm not sure I believe them.

            again, you're making blanket statements
           </p>
           <p>
            first of all, according to my research, about 80% of the "Jews" living in Israel are not Jews, but
            <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/05/16/israeli-researcher-challenges-jewish-dna-links-to-israel-calls-those-who-disagree-nazi-sympathizers/">
             Khazars
            </a>
            , which of course debunks their claim that Israel is their homeland
           </p>
           <p>
            as far as the Torah, see the
            <a href="http://www.truetorahjews.org/">
             True Torah Jews
            </a>
            website - i don't know if they're really true Torah Jews or not, but they claim to be and they're also anti-Zionist...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             True Torah Jews is dedicated to informing the world and in particular the American public and politicians that not all Jews support the ideology of the Zionist state called "Israel". In fact, a great number of Orthodox Jews view the ideology of that state as diametrically opposed to the teachings of traditional Judaism.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are concerned that the widespread misconception that all Jews support the Zionist state and its actions endangers Jews worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are NOT politically motivated. We are motivated by our concern for the peace and safety of all people throughout the world including those living in the Zionist state. We support and pray for peace for the people of the Zionist state but have no interest in and do not support the Zionist government.
            </p>

            i think it's pretty obvious from my research that they don't all stick together or agree, even on major points

            Jewish yes, but let's be careful to not put all our Jews in one basket :)
           </p>
           <p>
            there are many factions of Jewry and they do not all agree with each other - for example, some of the best holocaust revisionist works were authored by Jews and many Jews are anti-Zionists

            My thoughts on the matter are quite unorthodox, after some studies such as "Pesticide Turns Male Frogs into Females"
            <a href="http://www.livescience.com/10957-pesticide-turns-male-frogs-females.html">

            my conclusions are that the environmental toxicity from our lives are causing the drastic shifts in gender.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that there has always been homosexual acts in history, such as Greeks/Romans and young boys (although, they never took them home and married them - it was for lust only) or the Two-Spirits' of Native American origin (although, once again, the amount of gender-confused beings in these tribes were extremely rare).  I also understand that, in nature there are homosexual animals observed (there is also cannibalism, doesn't mean it's 'natural' in the sense of "good for the whole/environment").
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not doubt, for an instant, that these gender-confused people are genuinely having whatever feelings they're having (their brains are literally being rewired).  There are so many estrogen-containing products (from fat in red meat, plastics etc) in our daily lives that we ingest and pay little mind to.  The huge influx of transgender or homosexual people could be from the amount of toxins in their parents while in utero, or from their countless years of ingesting hormones in their diet, or from pesticides etc.  To me, this influx of people confused with their gender is like the influx of other developed country ailments (not trying to be offensive in using that word) such as; ADD, diabetes, auto-immune disorders, asthma etc.

            Chromosomes aren't as simple as XX and XY.
           </p>
           <p>
            XXYY, XXY, XYY, XXXY, XXXXY, XO, and XY/XXY are all valid, documented possibilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            But let's forgive your ignorance of chromosomal complexities and concentrate on your ignorance of the difference between sex and gender.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sex is a chromosomal, biological attribute. Male/female/intersex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gender is a cultural, social attribute. Man/woman/fairy.

            It's nearly entirely trendsexuals trying to score social capital by being part of an oppressed (read; privileged) class.
           </p>

            The worst part is the people living out their oppression fantasies by forcing their children to take hormones.

            This was a very well organized and executed agenda for someone (not sure who paid for it all) From the beginning, you could not say any jokes or anything other than praise. This went for every news organization, the talk shows everything. I don't give a shit about what people do, but I do mind an agenda being rammed down everyone's throat and nobody even questions it. Think about if this were happening 10 years ago, people would be able to discuss it objectively. Today, everyone smiles and says Bruce jenner is a hero. Again, I don't give a shit what people do, but I don't think that everyone would collectively agree that Bruce jenner is a "hero" without a very big machine pushing the agenda.

            I'm pretty sure it has a lot more to do with Jewish bankers and resentment over losing WWI on behalf of the Jewry cutting funds for the German warmachine and nothing to do with fairies or family values.

             while Jewish influence and corruption in areas of law, media, government and banking were certainly central to the expulsion of the Jews from Germany, there is no doubt that the decadence they brought to Germany in the form of widespread prostitution, drugs and the corruption of moral and cultural values was very important to Hitler
            </p>
            <p>
             if you study Hitler and read Mein Kampf, this is readily apparent
            </p>
            <p>
             Hitler was what we Americans might refer to as the quintessential Dudley-do-right - he didn't drink, smoke or approve of dirty jokes and there is no doubt whatsoever about his bravery, which he demonstrated several times in WW1, nor his love for his country and the German people
            </p>
            <p>
             while i cannot personally claim that the immoral behavior of a portion of the Jews was the primary reason many Germans wanted them gone (and let's not forget they were expelled in ~67 countries prior to WW2), there is no doubt that Hitler hated what the Jews had done to Germany from a moral standpoint
            </p>
            <p>
             from the book,
             <em>
              Did Six Million Really Die?
             </em>
             by Richard Harwood
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Rightly or wrongly, the Germany of Adolf Hitler considered the Jews to be a disloyal and avaricious element within the national community, as well as a force of decadence in Germany’s cultural life.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             from Mein Kampf
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              As soon as I began to investigate the matter and observe the Jews, then Vienna appeared to me in a different light.
             </p>
             <p>
              What soon gave me cause for very serious consideration were the activities of the Jews in certain branches of life. Was there any undertaking, any form of foulness, especially in cultural life, in which at least one Jew did not participate?
             </p>
             <p>
              I discovered the Jewish activities in the press, in art, in literature and the theatre. One needed only to look at the posters announcing the hideous productions of the cinema and study the names of the authors in order to become permanently adamant on Jewish questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here was a pestilence with which the public was being infected. I began to carefully investigate the names of all the fabricators of these unclean products. The result of that inquiry was still more disfavourable to the attitude to which I had hitherto held in regard to the Jews.
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact that nine-tenths of all the smutty literature, artistic tripe and theatrical banalities, had to be charged to the account of people who formed scarcely one per cent of the nation - that fact could not be gainsaid.
             </p>

            Your insistence on denying the biological truth that  I am a woman with a penis is disrespectful.

            So far I am only aware of fundamentalist Christian efforts to legally segregate bathrooms based on genetalia at birth. I didn't know transfolk were trying to criminalize genetalia based bathroom discrimination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally, I don't see your problem with that. Does denying you your right to segregate your bathrooms hurt your feels or something?

            It's just more of the Unequality Movement.  I need special and more rights than you.  I need you to treat me like I'm better than you.  You need to treat me better than other people.  Pay attention to me.  Listen to what I have to say because it's more important than what anyone else says because I'm special.  And no you can never tell me I'm wrong because I'm different and you can't ever say I'm wrong about anything.

              If you have a dick, you're not a female. Genetalia does not determine gender. For instance, boys have dicks yet they are not men. Daddy Long legs have dicks and they're not men. They're both male though (or hermaphrodite, they could also have vaginas.)

                I'm not trolling. I'm telling you that you're conflating gender with sex. It's OK, you don't have to be embarrassed. You're not alone.

            I dislike that it's getting as much attention as it is. I think there's been a lot of people doing it for attention and ruining their bodies.
            <br/>
            I do like that people are able to make a switch, don't get me wrong. I have a lot of friends who have found joy through it.
            <br/>
            As somebody who has struggled a bit with things regarding gender and feeling like they have the wrong genetalia, I'd rather the media stay out of it. It's embarrassing and sensitive and personal, and I'd just rather not see stuff about this all the time.
            <br/>
            If you pass as a woman, go to that bathroom and sit down. And vice versa. Nobody will question it or care.

            It's part of the diversionary tactics used by those who control the media and the US itself. Give these little freedoms to a transgender, quite small, minority while you steal all the other freedoms. Maybe no one will notice that most of the population is enslaved by the ghouls in control.

            I have grown up with trans people, and they are regular people like you and me.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, people that feel they are the wrong gender have a serious problem in our culture. Their bodies are not corresponding to the gender that they feel that they should be. This is a serious problem for them, because try as they might, they can't change their genetics. Unlike sexuality, genetic gender is a truely binary proposition (XY or XX). Let's just ignore hermaphrodites for this discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, it is possible for a person to be born with the perception that they were born as the wrong gender. As a society, we have a choice. We can either treat these people as someone with a disease, or someone that is just following what is right for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            As with most things that are inside the human existance, things are never actually black and white. Usually the determination of these things falls on a spectrum. There will be people at both ends. People who identfy with their genetic gender will be in the majority, while people that do not will be in the minority.
           </p>
           <p>
            Among those that DO have a gender identity crisis, some will be able to live with the fact that they are not the gender that they 'feel' themselves to be, and others will not be able to cope.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the point that we have found a person that both is not able to cope with the fact that they do not feel that they are the gender that was assigned to them at birth, and is so far beyond the ability to 'deal' with it on their own, we have a choice:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             We can treat it as a disease, and treat them as if they have a disorder
            </li>
            <li>
             We can use technology to change their body to match their 'identity'.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            As a society, we seem to be moving toward option two. I'm not necessarily opposed to that, because I think that would allow more people to thrive in our socitey, and the more voices we give to people, the better our collective perspective becomes.

             You seem like an intelligent person who actually has some in-site into this so I would like to ask you a question.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I were to write a list as to why I am male the list would begin with my sex organs.  Then I would write 10 pages of why I "identify" as male.  The list would include my hobbies, the sports I like to play, if I have any urge to wear makeup, my favorite color, etc.  Then when the list was done I would hold it up and say this is why I "identify" as male.  But then I would look at what's on the list one by one.  I don't want to wear makeup, does that make me male? - No.  I enjoy playing hockey, does that make me male? - No.  My favorite color is blue, does that make me male? - No.  Do those things make me female? - No.  Everything on my list would get thrown out and I would be left with blank sheets of paper.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the end the only thing that I can actually say that makes me male are my sex organs.  Do I want female sex organs?  Maybe, I dunno, they seem like they would be more fun, other than the whole period thing. I think it would be cool for my child to grow inside me from inception and have that bond, I think that would be kinda neat.  I like peeing standing up, I don't want to have periods, doing the helicopter makes me giggle and smile.  If someone says they don't want periods, that doesn't make them male.  Someone who says they don't like sweaty balls, doesn't make them female.  But the point is, in my mind, I don't see any reason as to how someone is able to "identify" as male
             <strong>
              OR
             </strong>
             female.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see and hear about people who identify as the other gender and they do/say all the things that they associate with that gender.  They wear/don't wear makeup, they cut/grow their hair, they say that this is their favorite color.  But none of these things (if you actually look at them one by one) makes them that gender.
            </p>
            <p>
             So in the end my question is this -
             <em>
              How can someone "identify" as a different gender?
             </em>
             Maybe this is like trying to explain color to a blind person, but I just don't understand how someone can "identify" as a gender.  I have no hatred towards trans-gendered people, I just have no idea how this is possible.

             Or we can just accept that gender is a spectrum and "third gender" people of one kind or another have been present in every society ever documented.

            like the OP,
            <strong>
             i completely support the inherent right to do whatever one wishes with their life or to their body
            </strong>
            , however my research into Germany's role in World War II has brought to light who may be largely responsible for promoting such lifestyles and why...

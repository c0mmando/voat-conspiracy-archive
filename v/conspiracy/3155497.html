            4d chess? Was this a setup to get rid of Assange? Trick him into cutting a deal so that they can later on go in and claim he is an extortionist? They would need to get rid of him regardless of who was in office.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully the next guy learns a few lessons from assange and we get a better leaker.

            I don't believe any of that crap.  Assange practically said it was Seth Rich who was the source of the Podesta emails.  I don't know about the DNC emails, but here is the interview where Assange reveals the source of the leak in so many words:

            Reminder that Julian Assange contacted the DNC ahead of publishing their emails and let them know he had them, though it is not specified how far in advance.  Judging by context, it was easily weeks or months of having the emails before wikileaks actually publishes them.

            seth rich was negotiating payment for the dnc data he leaked via wikileaks
guccifer 2.0 was a fake hacker op run by the dnc to provide cover for above leak
assange openly timed his leaks for political value but nothing else shady he is accused of has ever been demonstrated

             I agree Guccifer 2.0 was questionable for a number of reasons.

             Since DNC leaks had the emails first, I question how Seth Rich would have got them in the first place.

            It's interesting how the media has ignored john mark dougan's claimed role in this even though he fled to Russia, but that would go against the Russian hacking narrative.

             Consider both options. If it turns out Wikileaks received more than they published, then we are looking at a GCHQ operation from the start.

            Good analysis. Wasn't aware of DCLeaks publishing the emails prior to Wikileaks. Thought Assange was more in trouble for helping Chelsea Manning crack the code for the NSA computers, not publishing emails. Also, Guccifer 2 supposedly testified, but many whistleblowers have stated there is no such person.

             the dcleaks/guccifer 2.0 op published a small handful of dnc emails and a number of files. this was shown to almost certainly have originated in the dnc offices. wikileaks released all of it and that led to pizzagate amongst other things.

            What Seth rich found was Hillary was using his app to send her voters to specific polling locations just for her voters... That way when she election frauded the OTHER locations that had non Hillary voters it had a larger impact.

            These beans were spilled by his girlfriend and the quickly deleted right at the time of his death.

            That's what pissed him off enough to leak the emails to WikiLeaks because he was abeenie supporter and she was using him to steal the election from Bernie.

Even though the glitch opened access, users still needed to take deliberate steps to seek out such information.

              You should know better than beliveing Wikipedia, especially on political subject matter. First of all guccifer 2 is not Russian at all he is Romanian.... The claim he is Russian is a common MSM lie.

              Wikipedia is FULL is disinformation on this topic I suggest avoiding that if you want a credible source.

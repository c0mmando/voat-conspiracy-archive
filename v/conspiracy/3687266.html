            It keeps the wealth in the hands of the few "right minded people", kind of how the city operates. Have known a few Names over the years, who always make me wonder how on earth  will carry on,  but you only need a few controlling suitably woke and paid on message folk (goys) to keep it running . It is why the big accounting firms run things. The city is like another country not really Engerland or is it the other way round ?

            I read something after the 1996 Docklands bombings which said it would take Lloyds 80-100 years to recover, and a second similar event before that would cause them to cease to exist.

           People are hypnotized. That's it. I can't believe that all the fucking european and american elite were genetically idiots. As soon as I started learning world wide history, I was able to predict every fucking move. Am I a fucking genius? I don't know, you tell me.

            There are additional explanations, but yes people are brainwashed/hypnotized. Additional explanations:
"History is a set of lies agreed upon."
Human sacrifices - deliberately increasing misery and death.
Leaders actually being on the same side, or being misled by shadow leaders.
Dark entities that are controlling things from the shadows.

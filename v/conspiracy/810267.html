            Every since I've researched how the gov and marketing agencies get info, I have completely stopped participating in polls/personality tests/etc.  This is definitely a way that they can get info.  We know from
            <em>
             The Genterpersons Guide to Forum Spies
            </em>
            that they do these things in forums.  I honestly think they will use anything they can get their hands on.
           </p>
           <p>
            A fun little FYI.  Those little boxes that you see in town for a "FREE TRIP" that you fill out and enter, are only used to grab your info.  I once worked for a company that did that and they never gave out free trips.  They were just grabbing peoples info for their sales people to sell things to.  I'm sure the ones online are the same way.

             Reminds me of when my friend in highschool sold simple notepad.txts of business listings because of course people would pay money for information, even in the age of dial-up this was obviously the best form of media sharing to have ever been created by humanity.

            Exactly.  I always buy whois for the sites I build.  It just protects you from harassment and that kind of stuff.  There are website owner horror stories out there.  It's just a form of protection from the crazies.  You might piss of a SJW and next thing you know they're knocking on your door or following you around.

            There are plenty of those "find out which character from a popular tv show or movie you are" or "find out your stupid theme" name that are run by people who are trying to break into your bank account.  I saw a FB thread where thousands of idiots had posted the name of the street they lived on when they were a kid.  This is a common security question for banks and other accounts.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for personality tests in general, without other identifying questions, they're not of much use for nefarious purposes. Behind a computer screen, there's no way for them to know if they are your answers or if you're answering for someone else.

             Wow, that is definitely something I haven't thought about.  I always forget all about hackers being in the mix of info grabbing.  I can see how they can find your security answers using those tests.  That's good to know, thanks.

            It doesn't matter if they're intentional or not, the intelligence agencies are sniffing all traffic and backdooring everything (MS and Apple obviously complicit, Linux complicit via "PANT SPARTY" and "RUNNER KRISTY 6.7"). And you don't have to write something
            <em>
             specifically
            </em>
            to interpret the results of all these different surveys, you merely need to statistically correlate how people answered to their already-assessed personalities, i.e.
            <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2014/12/19/special-report-police-pre-crime-algorithm-uses-social-media-posts-against-you-in-real-time/">
             if you answer like a known terrorist did that increases your chances of being a terrorist
            </a>
            , regardless of the specific questions and answers. All you have to do is look at filed patents and wonder, "Gee if I was the intelligence agencies and had access to above top secret technology 50 years ahead of the patents being filed, what would I do?" Me personally, using just already existing technology, the first thing I would do is combine remote brain scanning with the ability to reconstitute words based on activation of labial premotor cortex, making remotely reading everyone in the world's mind trivial. Then I would use also already-extant technology to go the other way, to make my enemies hear things they think are their own thoughts. Oh wait,
            <a href="http://therundownlive.com/mk-ultra-mind-control-governments-voices-god-weapon-101/">
             that already exists, it was used in Iraq
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            But wait. Once I could remotely both send and receive information from minds worldwide, then I could set up a central dispatch to a (completely plausibly-deniable) network of sleeper agents, who can now request information from/give information to the apparatus harvesting it all. Agents who can mentally ask dispatch what the person they're talking to is currently thinking. And rather than killing anyone who finds out the conspiracy, they're made part of it and get to read minds, as long as they don't blow the whistle. If they're not useful as a sleeper agent they could even turn it into a parlor trick and set up shop as a "psychic".
           </p>
           <p>
            But that's just me. What do I know?

            Absolutely.  I read a description of how and why they are used on Facebook: ad targeting.  And yes, that data is sold widely, including to the government.

            Some are some aren't. It's like thing when you could find your "pornstar name" by your street and pet name which was used to answer the forgotten password question.

            Okay, I posted this as I was doing one my friend shared to me, and I just reached this end- but I can't complete it without allowing it to use my Facebook for the following reason:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The accurate calculation of personality factors and the level of cultural error
take into account a series of three personals factors : age, gender, and country.

            I might just be
            <em>
             really high
            </em>
            , but the Facebook-only finish and the last round of questions makes me super suspicious about the creators. Here are the ones that made me specifically feel like the test was trying to determine if I could be a terrorist:
           </p>
           <p>
            86- I like to stand during the national anthem. (Nationalism, loyalty to the government)
           </p>
           <p>
            87-  I start conversations. (Social, you are friendly)
           </p>
           <p>
            88-  I cry during movies. (Empathy, you feel)
           </p>
           <p>
            89-  I distrust people. (What it says)
           </p>
           <p>
            90-  I do unexpected things. (Potential for radicalization/extremism)
           </p>
           <p>
            91-  I keep my thoughts to myself. (Don't tell others your actions, secret plans)
           </p>
           <p>
            92-  I feel guilty when I say « no. » (You lie a lot)
           </p>
           <p>
            93-  I prefer variety to routine. (What it says)
           </p>
           <p>
            94-  I enjoy silence. (Praying)
           </p>
           <p>
            95- I am exacting in my work. (Technical skills, hacking/bomb making)
           </p>
           <p>
            96-  I can't stand being contradicted. (Only one true god)

             Smells like bullshit to me. If they wanted your age, gender, and nationality, they could easily get them from questions 97-99. If they require your fb profile, they want your name,  contacts, and whatever else they can scrape from it. Probably for marketing, but maybe for threat profiling, or both. I didn't see any privacy policy on their site.

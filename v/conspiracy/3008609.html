            Call me cynical, but I printed this article off when it was first published, and then went to see a friend of mine -- a very Americanized Muslim who was born and raised in Egypt.  He regularly attends his local mosque and made the pilgrimage to Mecca back in the 1970's.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is an old man, as I am, 78 years old and very urbane and well educated.  I asked him to study the article and to discuss it with me -- we have had many discussions about religion over the past 25 years.  There is a very quiet Egyptian coffee house in the ethnic area of the city in which I reside.  FYI, I am a practicing Evangelical Christian raised in the Free Will Baptist Church as a youngster, but am very open-minded when it comes to the belief system  of religion and faith practiced by others.
           </p>
           <p>
            The gist of his remarks to me were (paraphrased):
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Ah yes, but take this with a grain or two of salt.  The Holy Koran specifically instructs those who have Surrendered to Islam that to lie or deceive the non-believer, the infidel, the pagan, the non-Muslim, is permitted.  The Holy Koran spells out in detail that The Prophet did not err when He told His followers to (in essence) do anything they can possibly do to bring the world to Islam.  Does this mean killing innocent people?  Well my friend, that is a very 'Clintonesque statement' isn't it?  -- to wit, who is 'innocent'?  And who defines 'innocence'?  Yes, the newly born baby is innocent both in fact and in the eyes of God Almighty.  So when does the innocence end and the guilt begin?  Riddle me this, if it is a sin to be a non-believer and reject the teaching of Allah as conveyed by The Prophet, then and therefore, in the eyes of Allah the Merciful, the All-Knowing, that person then is a sinner and is not innocent."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Well, the discussion went on from there.  Let's just leave it at that and scratch our heads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I think the guilty parties are Jews, but even that is open to conjecture.

             The Talmud is the only quasi religious tract to endorse deception and untruth.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Dispute ye not with the People of the Book [Jews &amp; Christians] except it be with those of them who inflict wrong, and say "we believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you, our God and your God is one and it is to Him we bow." Koran Sura 29 Al-Ankabut, The Spider Verses 45-49.
             </p>
             <p>
              The correct spelling is "Moslem," in Arabic it is pronounced with a hard "s" whereas in written English when a single "s" turns up in the middle of a word it is pronounced "z," thus the Arabs say Mosslem which in spoken English is pronounced Mozlem. The term predates Islam and was used to describe those who have surrendered to the will of the Almighty in the days of Prophet Abraham, which similarly predate the Jewish religion

              Wrong. They even have a name for it. Taqiyya.  Or maybe you are Taqiyya-ing us...

               Does Islam permit Muslims to lie?
              </p>
              <p>
               Muslim scholars teach that Muslims should generally be truthful to each other, unless the purpose of lying is to "smooth over differences" or "gain the upper-hand over an enemy"
              </p>
              <p>
               There are several forms of lying to non-believers that are permitted under certain circumstances, the best known being taqiyya (the Shia name).  These circumstances are typically those that advance the cause of Islam - in some cases by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them.

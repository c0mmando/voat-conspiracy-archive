<p>Oh and i found another warning about the massacre before it happened. </p>
<p>We were actually warned about here twice. Once by John and another time by a guy who said Heather Heyer was planned.</p>
<p>&quot;Guys i don\'t have long but please take my message seriously. This car crash yesterday was planned in advance. I just want all of you to know another event will be taking place soon in Henderson Nevada. All i can say about Henderson is don\'t go to any rallies or parades or public outdoor events.&quot;</p>

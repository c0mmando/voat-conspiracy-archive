<p><strong>First</strong></p>
<p><strong>It has come to my attention that not everyone appreciates my sense of humor. üòáüôÄüò≥üòñüò•üòîThis world is so fucking distorted and twisted upside down, how can one not make fun of it? There are currently people protesting in the streets because it has been revealed that all over the world --- our elite politicians, celebrities and religious leaders fuck and cannabalize children.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our intelligence agencies are so corrupt that we all know that the CIA is spying on us. And we all know that the CIA has been experimenting on people since it\'s inception and is running the largest drug operation in the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We simply have to look up in the sky --- to see the chemical laden jet fuel streams that block out the sun, poison our crops and destroy our bodies and our minds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But sure why should we care about the quality of our air when we fucking allow all these chemicals into our food and food packaging.</strong></p>
<p>(Packaging that has been linked to causing gender confusion...hmm...does it not seem like there are a lot more transsexuals these days? It is honestly not their fault --- often their brain scan and body chemistry more clearly matches the opposite sex. And it\'s really fucking sad to see so many people so unhappy in their bodies that they would have to make such drastic and permanent changes to it. So unfucking fair. üò•)</p>
<p><strong>How is that not insane?</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Everything I\'m saying is true and if it sounds ridiculous, it is because our reality is in fact absurd...by design!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>But to people who don\'t have time my bullshit, at the bottom of this post you will find, just a sampling of the mountains of videos and picture proofs showing that the world wide space program is fake and that NASA is the Grand Deception.</strong></p>
<h2>(Unfortunately baby Jesus is not going to save us this time, because he is in fact a Spy!)</h2>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>Reddit, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and even 4chan at times keep censoring, shadowbanning and deleting my threads. üò°</p>
<p>Like all of you, I am simply trying to red pill and bring attention to the <strong>currently ongoing</strong> biggest conspiracy ever perpetrated against humanity and explain how The Mandela Effect - pedogate - chemtrails - poltergeists &amp; ghosts - ancient aliens - the NASA/SATAN Grand Deception - Jesus &amp; Satan - Isis &amp; Osirus - Cain &amp; Abel - Jupiter &amp; Saturn - the Devil &amp; the Messiah - Witchcraft - Hollyweird - Star Seeds, Light Workers &amp; Way Showers --- are all the same thing and that essentially it all boils down to the fact that our entire reality is a goddamn fabricated bullshit Grand Illusion.</p>
<p>This is all a test. We are quite literally in a Play.  All of this is of course really happening. Our elite are in fact evil. Inter-dimensional parasites do exist. At the same time, our world is <strong>magnificent</strong> and there are many more positive higher dimensional entities/angels guiding and trying to help us. There is nothing to fear! </p>
<p>This really all is a Grand Illusion!</p>
<p>But yeah, for more information please see my more coherently laid out rants here:</p>

            I'm all for conspiracies, but the ones that I and many other believe to be true are backed by a lot of evidence and very sound research.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm an engineer, I know maths, and I know physics, and I've tried many many times to look at the flat earth claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've tried real hard. Really really hard. And so far I have not found ANYTHING convincing in these claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, what I consistently find is flat out blatant lies, falsehoods and misdirections. At this point my only conclusion is it's either invented by someone with a high-school education, and no real understanding of basic maths and physics, or it's a very poorly constructed deliberate lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore there are only two possibilities here:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) You're sincere, but you just don't realize you are being had. You spend all this time and energy on a topic that is a dead end. You waste yours and everyone else's time here telling stories that have no real basis in anything scientifically or mathematically factual.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) You're trying to co-opt Voat into this ridiculous complete blatant psyop lie
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, I wish you'd spend your time on something more productive. "Exposing" whatever it is you think you are exposing doesn't do anyone any good.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your time would be much better spent concentrating on the immediate problems we face here, such as war, political and corporate corruption, media lies, and medical/pharmaceutical poisoning of our food, lands, and populations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I repeat, you are wasting everyone's time here, including your own.

             Sorry for the late response. The truth is, we all have to play our parts. And imho, each one of us, should focus on a issue(s) that we feel passionate about. And you are very wrong to think that I am doing this as part of a "psy-opt."
            </p>
            <p>
             It just doesn't even make sense to me when people suggest this. What would NASA possibly have to gain by having so many people claim that space or space as we've been taught, is the Grand Deception?
            </p>
            <p>
             Moreover, what do Flat Earthers have to gain, save for public ridicule, unless they sincerely believe this to be truth?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the mainstream media and scientists who have put so much effort into calling Flat Earther's a "psy-opt." The same mainstream media and scientists who suppressed so much of our ancient history, called 9/11 truthers mentally ill and Pizzagate fake news. Perhaps someone needs to redefine what a psy-opt is to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             One never hears about the mathematicians or air plane pilots, naval officers or scientists who also make up the Flat Earth movement. Instead the media uses the straw man argument and just highlights a poorly educated nut.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite that, I do very much agree with you, that there are many other very serious problems in this world that people should be focusing on, so I won't bother you again. However, I will always continue to expose deception and hypocrisy whenever I can. And whether you believe this or not, I 100% support your efforts in exposing evil and deception as well. Best of luck to you!

              It's not NASA that gains anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              A psy-op is an operation started by some 3rd party (for example CIA) to distract the populace from the real issues.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's an operation meant to waste people's time. That's all. That's what a psy-op is, and that is its purpose.
             </p>
             <p>
              Isn't it wasting your time? Very successfully.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I agree, you are entitled to talk about anything you want, and spend your own time as you see fit. I am only really concerned, as I see a growing number of people spending significant time on the flat earth theory. And I mean really an enormous amount of time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some people spend their full waking hours on it. I heard a radio interview of an unemployed guy who did nothing else all day long. Completely consumed. To the point he was unemployed and unable to take care of normal human duties. And I'm sure he is not the only one doing that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Flat earth has become a global time-waster of enormous proportions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Btw. I will give you just one example that you should seriously consider.
             </p>
             <p>
              In science a model is used to both validate and predict what we see around us. When the model does not agree with what you see happening around you, you need to throw out the model and try and find a better model.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I will give you just one example that is completely impossible to explain using the flat-earth model. There are many others, but this is easy to validate and check for anyone:
             </p>
             <p>
              During the night you can see stars rotate in different directions on either side of the equator. And not only that, the starts rotate around a different common point.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the northern hemisphere all stars rotate counter-clockwise. And they all rotate around a common point in the sky, which is the Polaris, or the North Star.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the southern hemisphere all stars rotate clockwise, and they rotate around a DIFFERENT star, which is Sigma Octantis, or the South Star.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the flat earth model we're supposed to live under a dome where all stars are located.
             </p>
             <p>
              In a dome model it is completely impossible in any way shape or form to have a rotation in two different direction, at two different locations, around two different points, at the same time. It can't be done. It's completely impossible.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can make Youtube videos about it as much as you want, you can't make it work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Therefore, it's impossible for the flat earth model to be valid. This is how science is done. Not with Youtube videos. You go out into the real world. You create mathematical formulas and you make calculations. The flat earth model is Youtube videos. There are no calculations. There are no formulas. All it is, is a bunch of Youtube videos.
             </p>
             <p>
              And it fails to validate the counter-rotating stars. And that is only one example. There are many more examples, but flat-earthers don't like to talk about them.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's not how science is done. Cherry picking is not science. It's dishonesty. The flat earthers are cherry picking all over the place, and skipping all the situations where their model does not work.

              <p>
               Thank you for such a nice response. If I'm really honest, I think pizzagate is by far the most important truth that needs to be exposed and resolved first, but am most definitely one of those crack pots who has become obsessed with finding out the truth behind the NASA space deception.
              </p>
              <p>
               Believe it or not, I have no shame though for this fact, because I believe our elite to be absolutely disgusting and so not fitting into their fucked up paradigm of what "they" think I should be, is more of a compliment.
              </p>
              <p>
               But anyways there are so many good videos explaining the star trails under flat earth using time lapsed photography. This one is short but has quite the snazzy sound track:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://youtu.be/afsb39_6QF0">
                https://youtu.be/afsb39_6QF0
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               What some flat earthers are missing though, is that while imho, we most definitely are on one of many, many, flat planes of existence, the truth is that all of this is just an illusion anyways. (Haha, and now I have fully confirmed to you that I am an old fool üòú)
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyways thanks for your time and for providing a very well thought out alternative point view, (And I will definitely check more into the star trails argument just to be sure) and would like to thank you for all of the excellent work you're doing exposing hypocrisy as well.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cheers! ü¶Ñ

               Pssst: I'm so happy that you brought up the importance of theories matching the observable evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it not just a little bit odd anyways, that just like the never been proven equation for gravity, the "theory of relativity" which has also never been proven, is only able to passably fit into the mainstream narrative by making up an exotic form of energy and matter (dark energy/matter) to explain 95% of the observable universe?
              </p>
              <p>
               Like you, I was always taught that our observations needed to match our theory? But I guess now we know that we can just make up 95% of the data and call it invisible!

                Also the video does not even try to explain the counter-rotating stars at all. You do realize that the stars rotate in a different direction south of the equator?
               </p>
               <p>
                Like I said before. You cannot construct such a lie where counter rotating stars work on a flat earth, no matter how hard you try. You can make Youtube videos all day. It's impossible.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's like trying to prove water is a liquid below the freezing point. Or that the color black is the same as white. It's completely preposterous.

                I watched the video. It's wrong. Again I see the same broken lies.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's simply wrong. It states you would need to be on the north pole to see the stars spinning around a common point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Not so. When the stars are a long distance away, compared to the circumference of the earth, it does not matter if you're on the pole or closer to the equator. You will still see the stars rotate exactly the same way.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is what I mean with the flat earth theory. It's created by people who do not understand basic mathematics and trigonometry.
               </p>
               <p>
                What they say in this video is simply mathematically wrong.  I challenge you to calculate this yourself on a piece of paper, and you will see that what is presented in this video is wrong.
               </p>
               <p>
                So you see what I mean. The flat earth theory is paper napkin doodling. Nobody ever does a proper calculation. They just put words on videos, and no mathematical proofs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again. From basic trigonometry and mathematics, what this video states is just plain wrong. You do still trust mathematics and trigonometry? You know, the basic building blocks used to understand reality.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you don't trust mathematics and trigonometry any more, but instead words on a Youtube video, then you're going straight back to the stone age.

                Check out the Electric Universe. Thunderbolts Project. There is an alternative, much more scientific theory, that explains gravity and the reason dark matter is the wrong viewpoint.
               </p>
               <p>
                Dark matter is not needed in the electric universe model, and it doesn't involve flat earth. This theory actually has scientific backing, but not by main stream scientists of course. Main stream scientists are locked in the dogma of their current theories. But you don't need flat earth. The electric universe model is very interesting, and to sum it up simply, it explains all the missing parts from the current main stream science.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just because main stream science has problems, does still not mean it involves falsifying data or any conspiracy. Main stream science is simply locked into their own belief system, just like hundreds of years ago people believed the earth was the center of the universe. The electric universe is the next evolution of science. The flat earth theory is a devolution of science.
               </p>
               <p>
                So you are correct our current cosmological science has problems, but to fall back on the old theories is the wrong direction. We need to evolve to the next level, not go back to old broken theories.

             Listen I provided a ton of video evidence to explain why I believe we've been lied to about the space program.
            </p>
            <p>
             i definitely don't know for sure what the shape of the earth is, but I do sincerely believe flat earthers are on to something.
            </p>
            <p>
             You don't have to believe in flat earth to accept that the NASA space program is fake.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fwiw, my personal opinion, which of course I can't prove, is that reality is a lot more malleable then most people realize. (Please look into the Mandela effect conspiracy if you are interested)
            </p>
            <p>
             And there is a reason why the elite have been sacrificing babies and virgins since our ancient history. I genuinely think Gray aliens are interdimensional demons. (That our anscentors called demons or jinn)

            Thanks man, that all I can ask! I think this is an important truth and tbh that flat earth was ridiculous when I first looked heard about it as well. It wasn't until I started researching it for a long time that I started to take it seriously. Now, I'm convinced that at very least the entire Space Program and space as we've been taught is bullshit.

             You clearly have everything all figured out. So what are your thoughts on NASA? Do you think they are trustworthy people?

            <p>
             Did you know NASA was founded by Satanists like Jim Parsons and NAZI war criminals like Werner Von Braun?
            </p>
            <p>
             I dare you to respond back with some actual evidence supporting your claims rather then just a mean insult. If not, I'm just going to assume you are an asshole and a pussy.

              <p>
               I am well aware that the holocaust never happened. I also realize that that Hitler had done an excellent job improving the economic and social conditions in Germany up until the Elite
               <strong>
                Jewish bankers
               </strong>
               declared war on Germany (from the safety of their luxury homes in Britain) after Hitler kicked out Rothscunt banks.
              </p>
              <p>
               But guess what, the Jews that were targeted during ww2, were not the satanic Jew bankers that declared war on Germany ---they were the regular shop owners and everyday people who aren't aware that that the elite Jews calling the shots are in fact luciferian.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again, I know that the mass concentration camps we were taught about in school is just bullshit propaganda from the elite Jews in Hollywood.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you are a fucking idiot if you think all Jewish people are like that. Most have no idea and have brainwashed been by Hollywood since they were kids too.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just like most Christians are disgusted by the paedophilia in the Catholic Church and aren't aware that the pope's brother is currently being investigated for molesting hundreds of kids.
              </p>
              <p>
               And you are also very misinformed if you are not aware of the horrific experiments that were done by the elite NAZI scientists during ww2 (these "people" are Satanists who masquerade as Christians/Jews) and came to the United States after the war during operation paper clip and helped found the NASA space program.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is the government and mainstream media that calls flat earth a psy op.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The same media that called Pizzagate fake news and 9/11 Truthers mentally ill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Or Is it just because you don't agree with my opinions which I backed up with a ton of video proofs?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Because there's so much that we actually agree upon. I agree that the Jewish Talmud, the Islamic Koran, and the Catholic Church is run by satanists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also believe that the "path of Christ" is the path of divinity and is the best path one can take.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Just because satanists believe that Jesus is Lucifer (at least the Catholic Church version) --- it doesn't mean that normal every day Christians do or truly that there is anything inherently bad with the message of Christ. In fact, i whole heartedly support his message.

                  <p>
                   Riddle me this, if you'd be so kind. Obviously you think I'm nuts or worse, you think I'm a shill and am current taking it up the ass from shareblue...but even still, do you really think Jesus would be impressed by the way you talk to other human beings? Just because you disagree with their opinion?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Have you ever been wrong before? (Note, I'm definitely not saying I'm wrong here) But you obviously do and so, is this really the kindest way to respond to someone who you think is an idiot?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Furthermore, if you've studied history at all, you would know that the myth of the Messiah and the Devil has been repeated many, many times before.

                  <p>
                   Ie. Cain and Abel, Isis and Osiris, Zeus and Hades, Saturn and Jupiter...as someone else rightly pointed out, they are based on archetypes --- all of us --- in fact are based on archetypes. Obviously I'm the Fool.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But if you really want to go deep, the Illuminati actually control both sides...and...wait for it... the truth is coming....almost there....here we go....this is all just a fucking absurd bullshit Grand Illusion. Your life, my life --- it is all a test. A game. Basically, we're all in a play, that we all created ourselves before coming into this life.

                   I know you won't believe me and will just hurl back a bunch of mean insults. But I've been studying this stuff for well over a decade and do know what I'm talking about. I can't prove that part, but it is my crazy truth anyway.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Feel free to write me off as a nut, but one day you will see that all of this --- is an Illusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And as a rule, like I explained to another guy, I will not respond to anymore insults unless they are very funny and I can't help myself. üòà
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However, anyone kind enough to speak civilly and heaven forbid --- back up their claims with evidence, will always get a response.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Peace!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Psst...if you're not smoking anything, maybe you should really consider it. When a ranting loon tells you to chill out, you really, really should! üòé

                       I hope at least by being mean to strangers who are sincerely trying to wake people up to the truth (at least as I see it) that you are happy in your real life. I can't imagine what it must feel like inside to have lash out like that.

                        Let me be clear: I fucking hate all the politicians. It's all political theatre! To keep us distracted. These assholes are all laughing at us behind the scenes, while they kidnap, rape and cannabalize our kids. How so many people on Voat can't see that trump is a Zionist illuminati puppet like all the others is beyond me.

            You're right about NASA telling lies and flat earthers have done an amazing job in exposing many of them. You're right to question the shape of the Earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I think flat earth's recent popularity is a psyop.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I don't think flat earthers take into account is that light bends.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/">
             http://www.wildheretic.com/bendy-light-the-evidence/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This explains why, no matter how high you go (whether top of skyscraper, mountain, or even high altitude plane) the horizon always appears flat. Flat earthers are operating on the assumption that light is straight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earth is concave and it's the exact shape that scientists tell us, just we're the ones on the inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS: I will give flat earthers some credit though, I think the weather pattern you cited is pretty interesting (maybe there is or there isn't one, but I haven't come across an explanation for that)

             Thanks for keeping an open mind! üòä And I appreciate you being respectful. I can take a joke but am feeling a little fragile after ranting for so long.

            <p>
             I am open to concave earth as well! I honestly don't know for sure if the earth is flat or what it is really --- I am just pretty darn convinced that space, as we've been taught is bullshit.

             My hunch truth be told is that all of this is an illusion anyway...have you gone down the Mandela effect rabbit hole yet?

            Flat Earth is a grand conspiracy.  Definitely one that carries the largest amount of distortion. The connotations of it are far reaching, and firmly roots you back into the major religions. It seems so many support the flat earth design. So then, assuming ancient relgions all are true, how do you unify them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Conspiracy Theories are inverted philosophy. Instead of why, its why not.

             You are so right!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm a little long winded most days, so my short response, is I really don't know either because all our spirituality and religions systems have likely been distorted and twisted by the elite --- and would advice that we just use common sense and try to internalize the lessons that we should have learned in nursery school.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ie.

            <p>
             Don't bite or hit. Use our words (Communicate). Share.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding religions:
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously Christianity, Islam and the Jewish Talmud/Kabbalah have been twisted by evil people. Both the Talmud and Kabbalah actually have it written in their holy texts that paedophilia (of anyone not in their faith) is their divine birthright. And we all know what the fucking pope is up to.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I have a real problem with any new age belief or philosophy that would recommend sitting on a fucking rock and mediating all of our problems away as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I love a lot of what Alan Watts says, but truly think that the "Path of Christ" is the best way to go. (Definitely not suggesting I'm anywhere near that good lol)
            </p>
            <p>
             This philosophy/path is so simple but would transform the world if everyone did it:
            </p>
            <p>
             To paraphrase our beloved Messiahs (and there have been so many devils and messiahs over the years)
            </p>
            <p>
             'Don't be an asshole and maybe just maybe, give a shit about about what happens to other people and not just oneself or one's  immediate family'
            </p>
            <p>
             The mindset that's hammered into our heads on tv and in school is that we always need to put our needs above every else. And look where that mindset has gotten the world? üò≥
            </p>
            <p>
             My more eccentric, spiritual beliefs come from deep meditation and haha the odd psychedelic journey now and then.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I can't prove what I believe in regarding God or the afterlife and worry that by including my beliefs it might negate all the real evidence that NASA and the elite have distorted our perception of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Space is not what we've been taught is pretty easy to prove if people are willing to look all the thousands of videos and pictures and then use a little common sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, there's no way imho, to know/prove what our greater reality is to other people unless they see for themselves. And of course, I could be crazy lol.

               Listen I don't want to alarm you, but I think you need to get you eyes checked. I posted a ton of videos in my OP to support the claim that The NASA/SATAN space program is then Grand Deception. In other words a lie. I don't know that the earth is flat, might very well be conclave, but it's sure the fuck not a spinning ball.

                 Fair enough, if you've watched all of the videos I posted and examined all of the pictures and you still can't see any fuckery in NASA's fake space program, then we'll have to agree to disagree. I appreciate you participating in this thread though and hope you have a good night!

<p>I hate to tell you to watch that video above.. but it pretty much lays it out. When this video was released a year ago we didn\'t have as much info as we do now.</p>
<p>Pay attention to where he analyzes the words &quot;2013 was the warm-up, 2014 was practice .&quot; </p>
<p>I believe they were talking about the 2014 FIFA games where there was a Zika scare.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/zika-virus-landed-in-brazil-in-2013-genetic-study-suggests-20160325-gnqzcw.html">http://www.smh.com.au/world/zika-virus-landed-in-brazil-in-2013-genetic-study-suggests-20160325-gnqzcw.html</a></p>
<p>Then note that one of the slides talks about &quot;If your reading this now it\'s already too late.&quot;</p>
<p>The author didn\'t mention it but I believe his shirt says &quot;WHO&quot; on it. For world health organization.</p>
<p>Notice how it shows the brain spilling out of his head.</p>
<p>Just so happens now reports are showing that Zika effects the brains of adults too. They are spreading a disease that causes degenerate brain function for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/zika-may-cause-brain-damage-in-adults-too">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/zika-may-cause-brain-damage-in-adults-too</a></p>
<p>I would also like to note that scientists came out and stated that microcephaly was NOT being caused by Zika. </p>
<p><a href="http://secondnexus.com/ecology-and-sustainability/zika-is-not-to-blame/">http://secondnexus.com/ecology-and-sustainability/zika-is-not-to-blame/</a></p>
<p>Shortly thereafter everyone\'s favorite &quot;debunking&quot; website Snopes came out saying this was unproven:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snopes.com/zika-microcephaly-outbreak-pesticide/">http://www.snopes.com/zika-microcephaly-outbreak-pesticide/</a></p>
<p>We all know how that snopes is basically a propaganda arm when it comes to politics and science which leads me to believe something ain\'t right.</p>
<p>Its my hypothesis that the Genetically modified Mosquitos that are being dumped in Puerto Rico, California, Florida and wherever else that we are being told are helping, are actually most likely spreading the disease.</p>
<p>There are reports that 1 in 4 Puerto Ricans will have acquired the virus by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zika-virus-spreads-in-puerto-rico/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zika-virus-spreads-in-puerto-rico/</a></p>
<p>Ask yourself, where did this pop up all of a sudden?  Why was this predicted in that video?  How did reports go from &quot;only effecting newborns&quot; to all of a sudden &quot;effecting adult brains with Alzheimer\'s like symptoms&quot;.</p>
<p>As a side note: The recent George Soros leaks clearly show an attempt to destabilize USA and many European countries. The Zika virus is patented and owned by the Rockefellers to which George has many ties. </p>
<p>I hate to be the guy, but I\'m pretty sure this epidemic that is about to hit hard is part of that plan.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Apparently this wouldn\'t be the first time this was done.</p>

            Thanks for the post. I think you are correct about the frame with the WHO shirt. I also remember reading the articles about microcephaly not being linked to Zika.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's another example of precedent on a "willing" community:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Drop_Kick
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also as to GMO mosquitoes they are already made, but said to be the same type of the Zika carrying one, but then once the two have mated the offspring will die. "Apparently," as they say. And they're live testing it:
            <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/fda-gmo-mosquito-test-fight-zika/story?id=41143198">

             Thank you for the reply. I was definately on to something by the amount of shills that swarmed my posts on Reddit. The ad hominem / tinfoil hat insults were absolutely insane. Glad to know there are many who are vigilant. We may be the first to be purged. Good luck!

              You should leave Reddit it is toxic. I spent a lot of time on the news subreddits one summer just to see how it worked; once vote counting was hidden it really took a big turn downwards. The original blog post seems to be deleted but this is interesting-

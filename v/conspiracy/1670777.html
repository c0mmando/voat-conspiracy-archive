            I thought that maybe this Milo scandal was orchestrated to distract from pizza gate and/or soften the blow for what's coming.

            While a christkiller would definitely fake things to get more shekels, a faggot would also definitely fuck children. The latter supersedes the former.

            He’s a faggot christkiller. To be a turncoat he would have had to be on the side of truth IN THE FIRST PLACE, which he wasn’t.

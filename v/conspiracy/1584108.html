            love the name, op. The ultimate question is whether or not Trump is as dumb as so many like to say he is. I've seen enough to believe that he's not, but there's nothing like first-hand knowledge as opposed to reading from such great distances the going ons of the elite and political powers right.

            If Reich had a shred of a brain, he wouldn't have revealed the strategy. If this is true... People say a lot of shit. Someone could have said it, sure, but Reich didn't name a name, which makes it sound like wishful thinking. (If Pence was "their guy", where was he in the primaries?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Letting "the fool" take credit for "tax cuts, deregulation, military buildup, slashed poverty programs, Social Security and Medicare"? It smells like 1938 -- "Let Hitler build his stupid Autobahn! No one will use it." This agenda could create an unstoppable monster, but, then again, the way these fucktards handled Trump in the primaries might suggest that this is the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Will Trump get impeached? Who knows? The ball's in his court and he's been put on notice.

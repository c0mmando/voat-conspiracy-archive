           Any one who has worked for the military, foreign service, FBI, CIA and other department knows that you can't accidentally spill any information above Secret and Top Secret onto Unclassified or personal emails.  "Secret" has its own network, you can't access it without a "Secret" clearance.

            Enh... Let's imagine that there is a "Top Secret" State Department memo that tells ... the Head of the FBI, CIA, and DHS that Osama bin Laden has irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, since we're in the realm of TLAs. Hillary's email to the head of the CIA could state "You should concentrate snipers within range of port-a-potties on account of OBL has IBS and shits every five minutes." By transitivity, that email is "Top Secret", but makes perfect sense to send. There's no "accident" there, nor any deception.

            You're spot on with Sanders, though. I think he wants her to attract attention away from people who are
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            doomed, like Lessig.

             If that's the case, I can't believe that no one would call her back on a secure line and remind her not to use personal lines of communication.

             Personnel in that line of field are usually hyper-sensitive of "leakage".  A slip now and then is not unusual--it happens, but 30,000+ is stomach turning.  That is why the FBI won't "drop it".

              I'm not certain the call would be important -- if she were using a secure server. Like, state.gov, or something with some validation.

             <p>
              A further point that no one has mentioned is that as senator, she voted on the data standards she violated... Did she read those bills? Do they read anything?

            Gee Wiz I wonder who would want/pay for that info? Isn't someone in prison for doing this? Something...Manning? Oh wait that person burned a CD of classified info then passed it to uncleared people on the Internet. Yeah, totally different because it was a Lady GaGa CD.

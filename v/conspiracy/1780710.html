            I think the Navy Yard shooter falls into the same suspicion. That story never made sense. Remember the ELF gun?

            I think we need to revisit a lot of these incidents.  I recall the police in Oklahoma were chasing some dude who allegedly molested a child.  I believe it was last year, and they found and killed him.  I wonder what the real story is?  He could have been out to expose something.

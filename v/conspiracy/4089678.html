            You are using logic, there is no place for that anymore. ;)

            Of course the ruling class controls both Nationalism and Globalism.

           <p>
            Just like they control the rioters AND president Trunp.

             But they're not controlling nationalism. Conservatism is not nationalism. The State is not a nation. This is what I was trying to point to. By using vague and misleading language, 'Conservatives' are basically 'hi-jacking' patriots who do not know the difference. You can be Conservative, all you like, but what does it matter if Conservatives keep The State in Sweden strong, if all the Citizens are Negroes?
            </p>
            <p>
             You comprehend that the nation the ethnic Swedes is not something Negroes can 'join' as if it were an organization. They can, however, join the Citizenry. By pretending the whole topic is about 'conservative values,' Conservatives are making a big show out of opposing socialists and those who actively embrace alien cultures and whatnot, but without saying a 'peep' about preserving ethnic groups. The diverts a big chunk of the energy of patriotic men, out into a wide open nowhere... Conservatism is not nationalism. The State, conservative values, Capitalism, these have absolutely nothing, at all, to do with nationalism or with any nation.

            It's sad that most people are already aware of these tactics and the way the media spins shit to cause division yet somehow this still became an argument between Trump supporters and Sanders supporters. Most people who support Trump and Sanders are not doing these acts of violence. There is a small pocket of agitators who are more than likely being controlled by an outside source to stir the pot. Thank you for your post.

            I think it was done to get Bernie supporters against Trump, so that when they steal votes and get Hillary as the Nominee, they (hope) that the Bernie supporters won't go and support Trump.

            The establishment, on both sides, needs for its outsider candidates to go away as soon as possible because they can't risk a split race.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bernie's #1 problem right now is Hillary and lack of media coverage.  Trump isn't even the GOP pick yet so it makes no sense to expend resources to distrupt his campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this protest by his "supporters" is either phony or only to pick up some air time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It definitely benefits the establishment for both outsiders to start fighting, change their focus before anyone's been formally nominated.

            I tell people who scream racism/sexism that you can't have a proper discussion on this subject matter without adding classism to the equation. They'll get her to the presidency using both legal and illegal means. Bankers and corporations always get what they want one way or another. These events prove that they're trying to make her appear to be the only electable candidate despite the fact that she is a professional criminal. I recently looked up the term Arkancide and I encourage anyone to do the same.

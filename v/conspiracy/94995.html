<p>Leslie Oliver is being “cooked alive” and Jesus Mendoza is dying a slow “electronic death,” as two more stories surface about torture and abuse at the hands of a totalitarian U.S. government using high-grade military weaponry against its own people.</p>
<p>Their stories of gang stalking and electronic harassment, by a U.S. government grown mad with power, add to a growing list of thousands of Americans who are desperately trying to alert the public about what they call “the perfect crime.”</p>
<p>And it’s called the perfect crime since electronic weapons are invisible while causing severe mental and physical damage on its target.</p>
<p>In response to the accusations, government officials claim to use electronic weaponry against only foreign enemies, but Mendoza, 52, of Mission TX, has uncovered shocking evidence in a lawsuit he recently filed that the CIA and NSA are authorizing the use of this weaponry against innocent Americans, including Mendoza.

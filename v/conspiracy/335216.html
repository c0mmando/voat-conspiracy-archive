            Just realizing we're all One is all well and fine but you'll need action to create your own reality. You won't get it from exclusively spreading the word through forums (though it helps a bit); you need to do something for that potential idea to be put into existance.
The idea of mere positive thinking is putting your head in the sand: you'll get screwed but at least you're thinking positive about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, we are all One. But that realization alone will not set our species free.

            Oh goobles, we could totally be friends AFK. I'll check out the site.

            I've only listened to Passio's stuff. It's funny when he gets really heavy handed, but I understand where it's coming from.

            We don't create our own reality, we just decide how we perceive it. With enough resources, yes...It's possible to affect reality, but  it's not very permanent as a fraction of the universe trying to control the rest of it.

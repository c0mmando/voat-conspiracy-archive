            ADHD is not a real disease. ADHA is a false diagnosis of untrained human ability and agency deeply affected and afflicted by electromagnetic frequencies and ion pulsing; for lack of a better phrasing.

            The mind is struggling with multiple currents of input that are generally more numb or latent in poeple on average. Polarity and frequency reference our ability to conceive ideas, speak in stream-of-consciousness diatribes, while also absorbing external sensory input and stimuli.
           </p>
           <p>
            Minority report provided many secrets to our current state of technology. We do have mind readers in deep saline water systems or tanks that are strapped to machines (developed by the nazis) that stimulate the human body on as many levels as possible in order to access the altered states of "light" and "sight".
           </p>
           <p>
            Moving through a dimension is simply the experience of photons being more visible to some people while obscured (distant and blurry) for others. If some thing occurs within an illuminated quadrant of space, it is either a matter of technology or time that allows us to see it. Either by device (telescope) or by perception (mind) as the brain is within the bounds, biologically speaking, of an electric universe. If something happens, it can be perceived. Photons travel on many wavelengths.

            ADHD is a sign of progress that is being treated like a disease, most likely introduced by governments and black organizations. Much research directly correlates EEG, 5G, and Radio frequencies with developmental issues in the womb, in adolescents, and adulthood. It is generally dependent on the ability of individual.
           </p>

            When the Alchemists of the 1800s began earnestly working towards a philosophers stone (a total, base essence [Essenes]), often referenced by older alchemists as a pure white powder, it didn't take long for flouride, cocaine, mdma, baking soda, polymers, glues, etc., be seen as advancements within the sciences.
           </p>
           <p>
            Naturally, ancient Alchemy need a modern twist on how it was utilized and taught among the luddites.

            My brother was hyperactive- my mom gave him a cup of coffee in the morning and had the teacher get him a desk where he stood to do his work- end of issue. We didn't do the Ritalin- that was prevalent when I was young- meth for kids- sounds great doesn't it? vs my moms black coffee.

            No such thing as ADHD. Just electromagnetic pulses effecting every persons brain a little differently. In an attempt to create a bunch of ESPers, we now have people running around connected to all kinds of shit and no ability to funnel or channel their new found energies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sea water and Chemical air trails are good at facilitating electricity, and radio transmissions through the ionosphere (transmissions are bounced of the ionosphere {we're told it's a satellite}), so you have a bunch of telepaths in deep water subs that even commanders can't enter the room. (remember all the occultists who practicing meditation in deep tanks in their basements?)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm all for the theory of the sky/cloud geo engineering being used as a some sort of military diversion/planet terra forming and weather control, but it really seems more like either bio engineering people as well as a polarized (metal clouds) central network that can be tapped into by their most talented people...
           </p>
           <p>
            Cell phones can be hacked to read EEG waves and sent to a server easily. All the metals they're putting into the air are either making us stupid, or a war tactic for increasing mental powers. Reading actions and perceiving thoughts before they happen etc.

            I knew a kid who had real ADHD - back before it was a well known condition.
           </p>
           <p>
            They tried lots of different drugs on him, over the years, with minimal results.
           </p>
           <p>
            He died in a car accident at 16 years of age when he ran a red light without his seat belt on.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is the only person in my life I have ever met with this condition - real ADHD is extremely rare.

            It's a thing, but I'll agree with it not being a disease. I personally think it's just a different type of learning. Most people I know with it are more of a "hands on" type person.

            I have been trying to expose the big "mental health" gimmick for a long time. It's funny how the two solutions proposed to mass shootings are either
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Gun control
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              More meds
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Anybody who has done their research knows that most of these shooters were already on meds (for example the Vegas shooter).

             CCHR: Despite 27 international drug regulatory warnings on psychiatric drugs citing effects of mania, hostility, violence and even homicidal ideation, and dozens of high profile shootings/killings tied to psychiatric drug use, there has yet to be a federal investigation on the link between psychiatric drugs and acts of senseless violence.

             Combine that with "people with mental disorders can't buy guns." ADHD is classified as a learning mental disorder. That means no ADHD folks can buy guns if that goes through.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the other hand, if you have ADHD, you can invoke protections and accommodations under the 19766 ADA and get extra time and assistance on things like school/work assignments, etc. and you they have to give them to you.

            It's real I legit had it. The medication suck one of the worst parts of my childhood. I do agree however that its over diagnosed and the drugs are over prescribed. Funny thought when I started smoking weed was when I was able to learn to control it. I no longer smoke or drink anymore and have no issues with adhd.

            It's not very well understood, it's complex, and it presents in a lot of different ways. It's also misnamed, as it's not really a "deficit of attention". But as far as disorders that are treatable by medication, its the most responsive. Don't be like me and suffer with it for decades, making shit decisions, failing to regulate emotions enough to keep friends, and failing to finish projects. You can find the diagnostic checklists online, meaning you can pretty easily diagnose yourself. If you have all the symptoms, try the drugs. Amphetamines have been around and studied for about 100 years, that's hard to beat as far as scientific data. Then, when they make you a better person, every minute, come back and talk about "ADHD is fake".

            If not fake or over diagnosed - my thinking is that most women out there forget that caffeine is a drug and will drink it during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.  My sister is one of those idiot people meanwhile I watch her lil halfbreed kid run in circles screaming cuz he is hopped up on a drug cuz she can't quit her starbucks and she doesn't tell him no when he begs her to have a drink.  For fuck sake...

            An interesting thing I heard about ADHD is that it may have been an evolutionary trait that limited some of our monkey brains from diving too deep into a hunt, or staying in an area too long and focusing on it without success.
           </p>
           <p>
            Start doing a thing, and if it doesnt work out your brain automatically turned you onto the next thing that seemed promising.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its interesting to think about and to me makes absolute sense from an evolutionary and even hunter/gatherer standpoint.

            No, it's a malfunction the area of the brain that handles executive decisions (such as concentration). The OVER diagnosis is the problem.

             This is so accurate.  Half these kids just need some actual discipline instead of Mommy running to get them a pill.  A lot of the rest are gaming the system to get stuff (extra time on tests, no punishment for doing wrong, etc). The ones who really need meds are pretty rare compared to how many are getting them.  We live in a society where everyone is looking for a magic pill to solve everything.  Too fat?  Why bother eating better and exercising when you can take a pill?  Kids acting up?  Why spank his ass when you can just turn him into a zombie?

              It's also fashoinable to normalize these issues. "Chill Pill" comes from Ritalin. Fidget spinners were for people who needed self distraction. Hipsters were just an expression of anti-capitalist folks with authority problems. Claiming native american ancestry is hip. Anything to get that victim or special status. Now one of Roy Moore's accusers are running for office, using that victim status for popularity.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last doctor I talked to about my ADHD herself admitted to abusing ritalin when she was working through her medical degree. Pop some ritalin, drink some wine to counteract the affect it gives you if you don't actually have the condition, sit in a bath and wait for it to kick in. Since Ritalin is a 4 hour drug, you just wade through your homework and studies for the day like it's nothing and then do whatever else you had planned for the evening.
             </p>
             <p>
              But wait, there's more. Ritalin kills your appetite (weight loss) and keeps you awake (get more done). Too bad it's so fucking addictive that it's so controlled that you can't get refills, you have to get a new script each month.
             </p>
             <p>
              BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The most commonly reported side effects that are related to Ritalin use, include, but are not limited to: overstimulation, restlessness, insomnia, dizziness, headache, dry mouth, loss of appetite, erectile dysfunction, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation. Ritalin has also been reported to cause high blood pressure, but in most cases, this increase is temporary and will not commonly lead to any significant long term problems. Some of the more serious, but much less common side effects of Ritalin may include: uncontrolled motor tics and tremors, pounding irregular heartbeat, chest pain, extreme agitation, aggression, mood swings, depression, paranoid thought patterns and difficulty urinating. By far, the most serious side effect of this stimulant drug is the risk of a potentially fatal Ritalin overdose.
              </p>
              <p>
               A Ritalin overdose could be extremely dangerous and in many instances, could be life-threatening. The symptoms of a Ritalin overdose may include but may not be limited to: abdominal cramps, aggressiveness, confusion, depression, diarrhea, fatigue, hallucinations, high fever, hallucinations, high or low blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, nausea, panic, rapid breathing, restlessness, vomiting, tremor, convulsions or coma.

             The brain will show many defects when it is deveolping. The best thing to do is let it develop naturally, not throw chemicals at it trying to attain an adult brain in a child's head. Kids being hyper and lacking attention is normal.

             No, no such thing as ADHD. Just electromagnetic pulses effecting every persons brain a little differently. In an attempt to create a bunch of ESPers, we now have people running around connected to all kinds of shit and no ability to funnel or channel their new found energies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sea water and Chemical air trails are good at facilitating electricity, and radio transmissions through the ionosphere (transmissions are bounced of the ionosphere {we're told it's a satellite}), so you have a bunch of telepaths in deep water subs that even commanders can't enter the room. (remember all the occultists who practicing meditation in deep tanks in their basements?)
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm all for the theory of the sky/cloud geo engineering being used as a some sort of military diversion/planet terra forming and weather control, but it really seems more like either bio engineering people as well as a polarized (metal clouds) central network that can be tapped into by their most talented people...
            </p>
            <p>
             Cell phones can be hacked to read EEG waves and sent to a server easily. All the metals they're putting into the air are either making us stupid, or a war tactic for increasing mental powers. Reading actions and perceiving thoughts before they happen etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of you are just talented. And chemical trails is either designed to keep people from using their abilities (ergo headaches, allergies, mood swings, sunlight obstruction {in theory if a photon exists, it can be received by any optical device given sufficient strength of the device. our brains and eyes are actually already capable of pulling from the ether without devices}) or designed to help faciliate other people. I'd also speculate they can attack people based on ethnicity or blood type. Gas attacks are nothing compared to what they created today. All weapons are now smart.

             As an adult, I agree that this is the case. I recently had EEGs done and it agreed with the findings you report. However, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I hadn't been stuffed with stimulants as a kid.

              It's one of those things that people will not understand until they actually research of have to deal with it personally. This is largely due to people not wanting to believe it, thinking that strong discipline is the answer to it a rambunctious child, etc ad naseum. Combine that with all the psuedoscience crap (vaccines and essential oils!) and people get jaded and say "Enough, stop trying to invent diseases". And it doesn't help that the medical treatment for this jacks up the brain's ability to concentrate and form memories and people just look at ritalin, etc as a nootropic so their kid can get ahead. It's an understandable knee-jerk reaction but with the sheer amount of medical data available to everyone, there's no excuse for it any more.

              My life would have been a complete failure. I had no means to focus on shit for any length of time. I just wish there had been something that was in-between the "chill pill" and the complete lack of control I would experience. Something akin to being "normal."

             Really? So a blood test, or an MRI can confirm? Oh wait that's right, if you have X amount of symptoms you have ADHD. That's the only fucking test for this fake jew disease.

             The malfunction is a lack of discipline in schools and the removal of spanking. This has always been a problem. It's well documented. The only thing which has changed is insane lefties have take control of the education system and removed discipline and punishment. The problems created by insane lefties is then chemically treated, which is shown to cause permanent brain damage at worst and potentially very long lasting chemistry changes in the brain.

                 Logical fallacy called a plea to authority. You should research more brain issues which also show up on MRIs. According to you, female is a disorder and should be treated. Or, if you like, turn it on its head and say that male is a disorder and should be treated. Interesting that this actually is argued by many a phd. Oppps.. There goes your stupidity again... dang it.

                  No, it’s defined as a defect. The scans show a difference because it is in the brain and is an area of difference compared to normal brain structures. You’re pedantic pandering is nothing more than a matter of misused semantics.

               So the model of brain used is people who don't have this variation? For example what about a mechanic vs a Harvard graduate? Is the mechanic's brain "flawed" because his brain works differently?

                This is talking about the "executive" area of the brain. There is a distinct difference between "works differently" and "works abnormally." We'd hardly argue that the differences in a schizophrenic's brain (or that of someone bipolar) is merely "a different" way of working since it is a failure of some of the parts which affect things. Come on now, that's not fuckin' rocket surgery. Attempting to mitigate what the differences are so that it can be shoehorned into "just works differently" shows a blatant desire to dismiss how differences affect processes. Because, you know, that kind of rationalization can be used to define brain death as "works differently."

                 The Harvard link you sent says itself that environmental factors play a part, for example abuse, so wouldn't it stand to reason that a child with developmental problems could be attributed to other factors than simply a "brain disorder"? It even says in the study that the effects are reduced as they develop into adulthood. Also, were these ADHD patients based on self-reporting?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Based on your conclusion that "there is a distinct difference between working abnormally and working differently", that doesn't hold much ground since these ADHD individuals also had a higher mean IQ. But you wouldn't know that unless you went through the pay wall or found it on some corner of the internet, how utterly dishonest (of them, not you).

                 I just think you should read both sides before accepting this kind of stuff as gospel

                  I was one of the first people diagnosed with ADHD back in the day. I know loads about it and have lived with it in some form or intensity my entire life. The executive areas are not firing correctly. Period. Because of the plasticity of the brain, it can eventually rewire itself to something resembling "normal" but it is developmentally retarded (in the classic Latin meaning of "slow", not the "dur dur retard" kind of meaning). The studies both in this article and elsewhere are based on physiological structures, not psychology. Psychology plays a role in managing ADHD but it is not any yardstick for diagnosis or medication. It has a physical origin which can be "managed" with medical intervention. The only possible cure is time and effort due to, again, the plasticity of the brain.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Being developmentally slow is a legit condition, yo. And it requires attention by everyone involved in the child's life up to and including psychological monitoring (ADHD people have an insanely high suicide rate and/or clinical depression - another thing that most people absolutely don't want to talk about), medical intervention, and various techniques (including strict time management, meditation, habitual "rituals", etc).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is not something you can just decide is a non-issue as it has its roots in a lack of physiological development in those areas of the brain Ask any parent with a child which truly has ADHD. They'll tell you exactly how it is and how it is not. Ask anyone with ADHD, they'll tell you how difficult it can be just going through the day, walking from one part of the house to the next and forgetting what you were trying to do because you found something else that needs to get done. These parents and children will tell you that you could beat/discipline/punish that child all day long every day and it's not going to make a difference. It takes years, sometimes an entire lifetime, to rewire yourself to overcome it.

                   That's great but your tirade isn't really relevant to anything I just said. Anecdotal evidence isn't very useful to me.

                    Fine, let's put it another way: You can wish all you want, it's still a developmental issue with a physiological origin whether you like it or not. Your opinion isn't going to change how doctors treat it or who has to have treatment.

                    And that makes me thrilled to no end.

                    Literally, your opinion is completely worthless and so are you. I hope you

                     Fact of the matter is I've been diagnosed with everything in the book and somehow today I'm better than ever without pills or anything. But I guess your anecdotal evidence is worth more than mine. Cheers

                       I came here to explain my theory and beliefs and see if anybody can refute it. Talking to people you disagree with is actually a really good way to determine errors in your philosophy or strengthen it, and simultaneously facilitate the spread of information. Everyone can teach you something regardless of how stupid or smart you perceive them to be, it's just a matter of if you're willing to pay attention. We are all simultaneously teachers and students.

             I dunno dude I was prescribed Ritalin for like 4-5 years during my time at school, I could never focus on school stuff unless I was interested. But I would easily spend 5-6 hours playing runescape without getting distracted.

             And now days I can easily spend hours reading into a historical event, historical and current political ideology, race theory’s etc simply because it interests me

              You are in the right. Do pay attention to any documentation about this stuff, unless it contains data and sample pools from before the 1850s.

              I was one of the first people in Chicago diagnosed with it. This was back in the day where they knew it was a problem in the brain and thought they could detect it with blood tests so my

               ass
              </s>
              arm was stuck with a needle every fuckin' time I went to the doctor.

              Adult ADHD isn't a thing except in extremely rare cases and you need to have had it as a child. It doesn't just appear in adults. And eventually that part of the brain tends to "catch up" in development. So, yeah, you grow out of it but it's not an age thing as much as a neurological development thing.

               fuck that. you are attempting to claim something just as sensationalist. the fact the numbers are skewed means its not referencable.. Your attempt to rediagnose the already Bullshit explanation is a flag for me and I trust zero of what you're saying, along with the zero sources you provided.

            If you keep boys cooped up in a school for 1/3 of their childhood, of course the are going to lash out with excess energy. Girls too but to a lesser extent. Public schools are just babysitters for welfare queens.

             Lmao when people think what's wrong with me is just that I have "excessive energy" I swear to god having ADHD is almost more akin to just having your short term memory or immediate attention wiped every twenty minutes than being too energetic. Yeah I was a spaz as a kid but now as an adult, the problem is very much in my brain, I am nowhere near as spastic or energetic as I was. On the contrary, as an adult now I'm always fucking tired but completely restless

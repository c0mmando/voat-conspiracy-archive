            Do the Jesuits control the Jews, or do the Jews control the Jesuits? I know there is some relationship between the two, but I don't know who is the dominant and who is the submissive.

             i find this the most informative in determining who is who through the ages: know your enemy (full):

             i think its a cooperation. some jews, called the synagogue of satan turned to the dark side and abandoned their religion and traditions.  they are called the sabattean frankists and donmeh (sufi influence) in turkey and salonica.  here they are today, in america, at yale, home of the jesuit order of skull and bones :

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             kemal ataturk was a donmeh from salonica.  the donmeh with the germans committed the armenian genocide in ww1
             <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/y6COy89cC77y/">

             </a>
             they called the armenians the jews of the orient.  so the german elites already carried jew hatred way before hitler and his nazis.  thats because the jesuits are tasked to educate the new generations of the elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             also, they might not be jews/semites at all, but khazars
            </p>
            <p>
             but the jesuits are crypto-templars, basically european gentile and catholic nobility who was infested with baphomet worship during the crusades. the jesuits control zionism, they created them and napoleon, the illuminati puppet was the first  known zionist. the bavarian illuminati was created at the jesuit university of ingolstadt, during the supression of the jesuit order (adam weishaupt, a gentile, was a professor of canon law there).  but the rothschilds also played a role in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             the fbi, the cia and the mossad were all created by knights of malta.  a catholic monk, bernard staempfle was the ghost writer of mein kampf

              A couple issues that I would love to see addressed, but society doesn't want an open discussion about this.
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                Yes there is evidence for a Zionist conspiracy.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                But, we need to acknowledge, that all Jews aren't part of this conspiracy (but, prove me wrong, if they're all "in" on this)
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Problem, how do you separate the Zionists, from the regular Jews? You can't just go roundin up innocent people.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Jews (non-zionists) need to wake up and realize that they are being used by the Zionists. This is difficult because the culture has made Jews sensitive to any accusations. And, Jews are a very tight knit community, they are susceptible to group think, and think that there could absolutely be no bad apples in their community.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                The "right wing" groups, while it's appreciated that they bring up discussion about Zion, they need to admit that all jews are not bad. (again, someone can prove me wrong on this issue)

             In my research there are 3 groups that are responsible for the new world order. Whether they are working together or they are different factions I am not sure. But the three groups are:

             <li>
              <p>

             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The Freemasons and the Mormons
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>

              It is my opinion that the Vatican is no different than any other large bureaucracy and is divided into several factions that are competing for power. Those three Catholic associations that you mentioned, I do not believe that they are  necessarily operating in unity.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think that if you were seeking those who have power, they are likely the same ones that have the wealth. Those occupy Wall Street dingbats, they were sort of on to something, except it was in the 1% that was a problem it is the top 1% of the 1%

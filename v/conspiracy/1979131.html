            "Trump ties to CHABAD goes back to father Fred or further. CHABAD is suspected MOSSAD safe cover... I had forgotten.  I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't CHABAD Jews cause they appeared in Germany in the 1600s around the same time my ancestors left from nearby.  Or maybe just serfs or Swedish soldiers.

            Putin's rabbi is Chabad too.

            Jared Kushner grafted himself onto Chabad House at Harvard - they are the most dangerous Jewish group - they bombed the hotel in Mumbai a few years ago - Chabad House was right next door to the hotel that was bombed.  They are the real terrorists.

            **Jared Kushner’s college rabbi recalls a snow-shoveling student mega-donor
**
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/jared-kushners-college-rabbi-recalls-a-snow-shoveling-student-mega-donor/">
             http://www.timesofisrael.com/jared-kushners-college-rabbi-recalls-a-snow-shoveling-student-mega-donor/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "In the years since Kushner came to Harvard, his family has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Chabad-Lubavitch institutions in the United States and Israel. In 2007, according to the Forward, his family’s charitable foundation gave $150,000 to the institution."
           </p>
           <p>
            These Chabad-Lubavitch institutions are very dangerous - Hasidic Jews.  Michel Chossudovsky (means Hassidic in Russian) is a Russian Hassidic Jew from Rostov-on-Don, and his father was the most influential mover and shaker in starting the UN.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Run by emissaries of the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement, campus Chabads offer Orthodox ritual services and Jewish programs to students of all backgrounds, often as an alternative to Hillel, the legacy nondenominational Jewish campus organization. Chabad has built a sizable following among Jews who, like Kushner and his modern Orthodox parents, may not be Hasidic themselves but support its programs and outreach efforts."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Kushner’s relationship with Chabad began when he visited campus for a pre-freshman weekend and attended Shabbat dinner. During the subsequent four years, Zarchi says, Kushner was instrumental in bringing undergraduates to Chabad, which had been geared to graduate students. Two people who attended Harvard with Kushner told JTA that he was quiet, unassuming and dedicated to the Chabad mission."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Since his graduation nearly 14 years ago, Kushner has stayed connected to Chabad. He has helped organize the institution’s alumni events, including a Shabbat dinner that he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, hosted a few years ago. In 2004 and 2005, while Kushner’s father was on trial in New Jersey for illegal campaign contributions, witness tampering and tax evasion, the family would occasionally eat Friday night dinners with the Zarchis at Harvard Chabad while Kushner’s brother, Joshua, was a student at the Ivy League school. Charles Kushner served 14 months in prison for the charges."

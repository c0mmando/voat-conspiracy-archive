            But most of our metallurgy comes from China, and since NK and china are allies, the CIA can't simply assassinate Kim Jong Un. But the media did report on Kim blaming the CIA for trying to assassinate him a few months ago, so it's hard to say what the globalist elites are up to. Hyping up nuclear war only for it to never happen is highly suspicious, but the real question is why.

             This is the whole issue. The US (and Japan and South Korea) would like to reunify, but with the entire country of Korea allied with the west.
            </p>
            <p>
             How they think they will do this? I'm not sure if they even have any idea, but as intelligence agencies usually do, I'm sure they've got some kind of plan. Which will probably have the same chances of success as their previous ones.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, of course, the Chinese are not going to sit idly by and let their ally be snatched out from under them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think this is another case of there being a really juicy resource prize tempting the the MIC and they're making a play. Whether it turns into some quagmire like Iraq remains to be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The big difference this time is that North Korea share a very long border with China and a small border with Russia. This raises the stakes for the US and South Korea hugely.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, the fact that China has a stranglehold on the rare earths  market means that the high tech the US military depends on would be caught in a vise. One of the very first things China would do in the event of an attack on North Korea is cut off export of rare earths to the US and its allies.
            </p>
            <p>
             No rare earths mans you can't make the computers and heads up displays and fly by wire controls and other stuff modern airplanes depend on, just as one example. The US would have to start drawing down its strategic reserves, and sharing those reserves with the Japanese and Korean companies that make so much of the equipment they use.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's obvious why the US military is
             <strong>
              so
             </strong>
             determined to get their own source of rare earth minerals. In spite of all their bluster and noise,
             <strong>
              they basically can't really fight a war against China, or any of its important allies until this situation of China having 90% of the world's rare earths deposits is changed
             </strong>

             Yes, I remember reading about these surveys going on years ago.

             I'm not convinced that sea mining is as easy or cheap as professor Kato is theorizing. I think that's why the Korean mine is so attractive the US &amp; Allies. Mining on land is much cheaper.

              and then you could keep all your expensive pumps and equipment up top in a big cargo ship?

              Add in a drill head and some pathfinding equipment to the vacuum and you could get a lot done.

               That's actually basically what sea miners do, unless coring or dredging is economicly doable.

              <p>
               That kind of gear costs in the 9 figures, though, for much lower production than you get from a land-based conventional mine.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your cost per ton is still way lower with convention land-based mining.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is, rare earths are
               <strong>
                so
               </strong>
               important strategicly that there might be support to make this sea mining work, even if the product costs a lot more.

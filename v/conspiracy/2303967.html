            Sometimes in the profession world when you discover that you are a pawn of a chess player you ask how can I be a better pawn.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's to their career's interest to be an effective pawn.  These people are all vain because they are in a media industry.  They look to the guy at the top and ask how do I get there.  And the people in charge know that's what their workers do so they place their most loyal pawns at the top.

             I disagree with that.  I think Hillary Clinton is a good example of someone who makes all the right moves but in the end she's not awarded the prize because she's simply not likable.  Being a good person is more important than climbing the ladder.

             Fuck the media as a whole. They have deceived many through their selective news reporting. Now the entertainment is so sexualized, violent, and uneducated social drama. where someone's personality is damn near half the entertainment. I can't stand what information and entertainment is forced to the common people who still rely on their tv.

            But don't come asking for everyone's IP, and try to bullshit a good reason for it, just because you want to hack or ddos people that disagree with you.

            Publish IP addresses and virtually ensure that no whistleblower ever peeps to Voat. There are times where anonymity, or as close to it as we can get, are useful. IP is considered personal information up there with tax registration numbers in some jurisdictions (like the EU).
           </p>
           <p>
            A better idea might be to have something that says the percentage of posts made from the same IP address for that user account, or percentage for the top 3, because people might be like me, on a mobile all the time. This gives you an idea of their posting habits without revealing the actual IP address. Even an automatically populated colored bar chart with 'IP #1, IP #2' percentage bars with all IPs for that account, without the actual IPs showing. That data, particularly in an easy graph form, provides useful information about posting habits without compromising people's safety.

             I would make it optional. I would display the IPs because Mossad and NSA already know them... And Goggle sells this information, as well. A whistleblower should be well advised to know that even if the IP doesn't get recorded and displayed on the server, it IS collected by NSA, so they should definitely go through TOR to blow the whistle on something.
            </p>
            <p>
             Percentage of posts from Same IP is great... but I want them the Make the IP's available.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like this because:
1. If you want to display your IP... that's fine.
2. If you want to hide your ip, and you think the fact that it isn't displayed keeps you safe, I want you to learn a bit.
3. If you really want to hide your identity, you HAVE to go through some sort of onion proxy.
3a. If you are a whistleblower and I get your ToR address of the post as 101.99.145.121, I can't do anything with it. I can only triangulate someone who is making a buttload of posts from the same location. I'd need 100-200 in a day to properly triangulate, so this is ONLY effective against vote farms.
3b. The people who run Voat shouldn't have to handle the forensics and investigation of such things. Users of Voat, armed with Excel and one or two trap proxies, can pinpoint the subversion without involving the administrators.

               Semi-Static is where you are assigned a dynamic by DHCP, but it is relatively static, even though you're not paying for a static IP from Comcast.
Vpn on the same subnet as other vpn connections. If your proxy-out box is always on the 192.155.151.x subnet, that is useful.
Nat your IP... mask your ip. It's not using your computer's IP to connect... It's using the Gateway of the VPN network, and that is usually natted.

            NO (if i could make this 250p i would...), there are tons of things one can do with an IP, because you don't know any does not grant you the authorization to make such calls on behalf of others. Thank you.

            Note: if you want to tell about vote manipulation, then ask for a hash of the ip, but please don't request everyone's ip to be up for grab, for fuck sake what is wrong with you?

             Anyone worth their salt would know that a hash of an ip is just as back traceable as the actual IP. Since there are only 2^32 possibilities, my computer could calculate EVERY hash in about 2 seconds. Your insults are childish. You obviously don't have a clue what you're talking about. No one with ANY experience would recommend a hash of a known fixed set.
            </p>
            <p>
             The idea that I cannot get your IP is ludicrous. I'm recommending making it optional, anyways. If you want your ip shown, and tabulated as static, it gets tabulated as static. Just because you don't know how to secure a router (which is the fucking default from comcast) does not grant you the authorization to assume everyone else is a doofus.
            </p>

             Here's google's IP... GO NUTS! I'll expect them destroyed in the week.

              I'm a white hat. I never use IP's for malicious purposes. I use IP's to triangulate vote brigades. Or, if you give me your ip and ask me to, I'll do a threat analysis for you. For a home computer, though, I'll almost always run up against the fact that 99% of routers don't come with a default "admin"/"password" any more... they also don't allow administration from the WAN, and they don't port forward... so Give me your IP, and I'll probably do a port scan and say, "No ports open"... because the default comcast router isn't stupid. I also collect IPs to study threat surfaces, because that is critical to my job. I also collect IP's occasionally to play pranks on other Hackers. Fun stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've done threat surface analysis on four major products covering a user base of 80-100million users. Microsoft Project, Microsoft SharePoint, Starbucks Card(tm) and StackOverflow(internal) for XBox support. In fact, the last 6 products I've made have required deep threat analysis... so.... what do you do? You some codemonkey from an insurance company or just a troll?

              Why can't people ever say, "I'm a newb. I was talking out my ass."

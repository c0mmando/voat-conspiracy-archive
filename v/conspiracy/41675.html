            Your time would be better off spent focusing on destroying usury, the funding behind all false flags, rather than the false flags....more importantly, undermine the peoples faith in the currency...it is only the faith that makes it worth anyhing

             I get your point, but I guess you live in North America, right? U.S./Mossad/SomethingSomething terror has never crossed into Europe in the disguise of Islam before. This is a huge step, as France is the country with the highest Muslim population within Europe. I wanted to document this for the future, because first of all, a lot gets lost in the media circle jerk and second, there are many many people out there who haven't even heard of the word false flag. Let alone they have gone down the road critiquing currency as a whole on the meta level you're talking about. I think this is kind of important to try to pick our neighbours up where they are ... This obviously does not come as a surprise for anyone, but I am trying to find ways to abuse the system we live in for our own good, if that makes any sense.

              You have a point as to why, precisely, this false flag event took place in France. Your comment just cemented in many of the "missing pieces" that I've found regarding this incident.
             </p>
             <p>
              "TPTB" are trying their absolute hardest to garner "Islamophobia" around the world. Where better to gain a European foothold than France? There already is a gigantic foothold in America amongst the Christian population (again, further progress in Israel attempting to get the Christians, whom they hate, and the Arabs, whom they hate even more--to go to war with each other FOR them) and this will only grow as the hard-core Christians are, by and large, very ignorant people who have no idea that Israel not only hates them...but wants them eliminated. See the "price tag" incidents in Israel for further details.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's hope that Christians can figure this out. I sincerely doubt it as most of them have the "critical thinking" ability of a piece of slate...but I guess that there's always hope.
             </p>
             <p>
              PS--Not sure if it's my connection or Chrome but OPs link will NOT load correctly. It's a shame! At the top it's asking me if I'm done with changes and if I want to publish--the entire rest of the document is empty space and words superimposed on pix, broken links, etc, etc. I let it load all night, &lt;9 hours, and I still get the same result. I'd really like to read it as, from what I CAN read, it really blows the entire Hebdo false-flag wide open.
             </p>
             <p>
              I especially enjoyed that one of the blue-eyed "terrorists" (likely a Mossad kidon) shouted "We are Al Qaeda from Yemen!"

              Quite an introduction, that!

              I feel that most people  GET VERY MAD when they get "ripped off" "violated" "taken advantage of " "stolen from" etc. And they get even more mad when they find out that it has been happening to them their entire life.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any fight against the NWO on any level is good, keep it up, But I feel by focusing on money, as eveyone just loves their money, and by showing people how it is being used against them, triggers the most intense response and thus promotes action of some sort more so than other "conspiracy"
             </p>
             <p>
              The stories of the innocent dead live on in peoples minds, but quickly fade to memories not relevant to their own life....whereas being constantly raped in a usury scam happens to them on a daily basis and effects every moment of their life until they die....
             </p>
             <p>
              lets not mince words....you work your ass off...you make X amount of dollars....out of that X amount of dollars you are paying X percent to WHO FOR WHAT?...it does not matter if you live in the usa or europe...there are NO COUNTRIES there are only regional monetary regions that are ruled by the omnicorp central banking system....and that is what should be focused on in my opinion. That and that "our" faith in this currency is the true problem...terror will not be stopped until people understand who the terroists are and whsat their motives are....ie. keep you having faith in them...they will do so by pitting you against each other and creating sides

            Do we know that anyone actually died in the Pentagon? I thought that wing was under construction or something.

            People think a 100 ton aluminum plane can hit a 500,000 ton steel and concrete building and not crumple like a tin can. Smh

            You are right.  These are powerful questions.  They would be even more so if you had some kind of proof of the premises they are based on.  Lets say for instance proof that billions of dollars of precious metals were stored in, and withdrawn from the COMEX vault.

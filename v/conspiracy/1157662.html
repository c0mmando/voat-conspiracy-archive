            OK - stupid question.
           </p>
           <p>
            How likely is it that FEMA camps will be used to round up the resistance when TSHTF? Are there any other legitimate uses that they could be for? Disease outbreak quarantine, maybe?

             It really could be any combination of things. Perhaps a viral outbreak happens, and they use the camps as a quarantine, and they toss the resistance in there as well to die from the sickness. Maybe theyre just prison camps for those caught rioting. I'm sure there are plenty of legitimate uses for FEMA camps, but the government has a track record of always having multiple purposes for every action they take.

            Each day more and more shit is hitting the fan.... Its starting to feel like something very sinister is on the horizon. Jade helm certainly went down the memory hole didnt it... I think its interesting that more people didnt talk about how it was run by an omniscient super A.I. that computes battle plans and calculates how people will react to situations based off of NSA metadata. Martial law is looking more likely by the day, I just hope there are enough actual patriots in the armed forces that they will refuse to fight against us but I guess time will only tell.

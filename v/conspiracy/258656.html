            Well, it is the basis of what you call civil rights. You do not have human rights, you have civil rights. That's because ever since the French Revolution European states have taken Rousseau's ideas (meant to protect humans from the arbitrary ruling of a non-appointed head of State i.e. the king) and codified common law into written law (sheesh, I realize I'm cutting corners here when quickly pointing out the history) but the original idea has deviated since then.
           </p>
           <p>
            Human rights as you know them (right to a fair trial, open courts, free speech etc etc) didn't exist until the late 1700's with the birth of the First French Republic and the Bill of Rights of the Americas. There was the Magna Carta in England, but that gave only limited protection against arbitraty rule from the king.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rousseau wrote that Man is born free, with all his free Natural Rights which include the right to kill whomever one doesn't like. In order to avoid such a free natural state (life's brutal, nasty and short already: read Hobbes) he thought it necessary to strip Man from his Natural (human) Rights and instead turn everyone into Citizens/Civilians bequeathed with Civil Laws (codified into law). This was meant to protect people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with civil rights is that they have been given to you and can just as easily be taken away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast-forward a bit to the 20th century (I know, I'm REALLY cutting corners) and there is-especially in Europe- a growing trend of strenthening the Strawman. It can be found in any lawbook, where it is indicated that you can have a natural personality and/or a legal personality. The legal personality (persona iuris) is given or attached to a living body from the moment a child is registrated with the State and seen as to have ended with the death of the natural person (persona naturalis).
           </p>
           <p>
            Much, much more is written but I don't have the time right now to give you a 4 year course in Philosophy of Law (unfortunately :p Will respond as soon as I have time)

             Your example makes sense compared to what I was exposed to. I work in financial services and was originating a loan for a man and his granddaughter when he mentioned this theory. She was a little shaky about her capacity to pay the loan back and he assured her that her straw man would take care of it. I was dumbfounded and asked him to elaborate a little more. His theory was that one million dollars is printed in your name as soon as you are born and is used to satisfy your debts. He then went on to say that anything you receive in the mail printed in all capitals is the responsibility of your straw man and not you as a person.

              Yes and no. Yes, you have been used as collateral for private banks by your governments. This is because governments all over the world are bancrupt and have used their population as collateral in order to lend 'money' from private central banks in order to cover their debts. Ever wondered where such a thing as the government debt comes from? 
Yes, you are worth between I believe 30 million and 60 million dollars/euros over a given lifetime (taking into account age, social class, lifestyle, healthcare, taxable income, taxes in general, spending, earnings, pensions and of course tickets). That is why your greatgrandparents did not have social security numbers, and you do. The date of socialsec. numbers was the moment your strawman became an asset, attached to your natural body.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, there is a catch: as long as you do NOT know this, you identify yourself with your strawman (which you are not. You are you. You are not, I repeat NOT, your legal fiction).
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the strawman who is the owner of all the goods, benefits, profits, property that you (the natural body) have worked for. It is the strawman who is being punished in court, but it is your natural body which does the time in jail. You, the human being, own
              <em>
               nothing
              </em>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              So if you take out a loan, taken out in reality by the strawman (yes, here the all-capital name indicates the legal fiction and not the natural person), the strawman receives said amount on his/her bankaccount. Remember that your bankaccount is not yours, though you think it might be. It belongs to the strawman. Look on the name of your card. For that matter; look in your passport and see to whom it applies and to whom it belongs (hint; it applies to the strawman and it belongs neither its nor your property to you nor him). 
Since you identify yourself with being the strawman, you will pay with your energy and body the obligations of the strawman, even though the strawman should be the one having to do all the work in order to pay off said debt. Since the legal fiction/persona iuris/strawman exists only as an all-capital name on a piece of paper, this poses a small problem. You have tackled that problem by thinking you are indeed your strawman and now have to work it off with your energy. Congratulations, you have just entered a life of debt.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the catch I was talking about before: there is NO obligation to accept the strawman without your knowing or consent. Not a damn obligation. 
The strawman was given to you without your consent when your father declared at the local authorities that you were born. At least, that's what he meant to say. What he really said was that he and your mom had produced another economical unit which has a monetary value of XXXX. The local authorities congratulated your dad and registered you as collateral. You have been issued a serialnumber, either named as such or named as a social-security number. Either one, it makes no difference. You are now a number. About a 100 laws now apply to you, whether you like that or not. And for the coming 18 years you have no say whatsoever in the changing or abolishing of said laws. If you turn 18, about another 10.000 laws (and counting) aplly to you. And you have been given your all-capital strawman.(check your birth certificate if you think I'm pulling this out of my ass). By the time you're 18 you are convinced you are your strawman.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a fraudulent contract. You were maybe a week old so in no condition to negotiate contractterms. Your dad was oblivious and didn't know what he had gotten you into. Ergo, a contract (and the strawman is just a contract, although a one-sided one) which has been sealed without consent and complete knowledge by both parties is null and void.
             </p>
             <p>
              HOWEVER: as soon as you have been made aware of this deceptive use of a legal fiction, you cannot  in good conscience use it since it is not you. It would mean having one of two things:
             </p>
             <p>
              1)using the strawman to seal contracts, receive benefits etc without ever working for them with your natural body and energy; whenever the taxman cometh, you refer to the paper entity which bears the name of the strawman. Fat chance getting a piece of paper to work off the debt it has gotten itself into. There is however the small possibiliy of repossession, though. But even that can be countered by a good lawyer (no joke: everything has been made legal nowadays and to fight a legal battle, get a lawyer).
             </p>
             <p>
              or
             </p>
             <p>
              2)renouncing all claims to said strawman, social security numbers, pensions etc etc. laws and obligations do no longer apply to you as long as you do not harm people and behave in a decent, honest and peaceful way. You become a free, natural human being, without having to obey to every nincompoop-law; you do not pay taxes, you do not carry a passport etc etc etc. You are free.
Small catch; it is very hard nowadays to work without papers, soc.sec.number and the likes. The economic, legal and political strawman-system is deeply installed now and very hard to break out of.

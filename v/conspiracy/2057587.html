<p>My first thought was - if i wanted to strengthen my cause and get people pissed at the right they need to attack us. </p>
<p>The first reports on fox witnesses were saying the car had no plates.  Some guy was saying they just let them through because they thought it was police. Later they are saying that people were pelting the car.  There had to be something to the &quot;no license plate&quot; reports. </p>

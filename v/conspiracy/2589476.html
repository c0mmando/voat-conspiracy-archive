            President Lyndon Johnson in 1966, caught by his own recording equipment, in which he declared about Diem:
           </p>
           <p>
            “We killed him. We all got together and got a god-damn bunch of thugs and assassinated him.”

            It is not clear whom he meant by “we.” Holy crap.

            The reported (and prominent) Nashville attorney representing country music singer Jason Aldean and the Route 91 music festival, Orville Almon Jr., has passed away unexpectedly at the age of 66. 1 His death, which was listed as “natural causes,” marks the 5th unexpected death of someone connected to the festival. It is believed he died from an unexpected “seizure during sleep.”
           </p>
           <p>
            What is going on?
           </p>
           <p>
            Before his death, it’s reported that Almon Jr. was negotiating with record companies and drafting “issue-specific” agreements, as well as book deals.2
           </p>
           <p>
            Almon Jr. had a reputation for being quite good at his job but according to his social media posts “his interactions and interviews with the FBI, MGM, and Las Vegas Police Department” were “incredibly strange and complex.” 3 His posts have recently been made private.
Since the Vegas shooting carried out by the SOLO 64-year-old, Stephen Paddock, those who claimed to have witnessed two shooters, have been found dead under very odd circumstances. And there was also the case of Jesus Campos, who disappeared before he was supposed to make his mainstream media rounds, only to end up giving Ellen an exclusive interview. His only interview to date.

Lastly was Danny Contreras (who we were unaware of until now). “Contreras was shot to death in a vacant Vegas-area home days after the shooting, and local police have attributed his death to gang or drug activity. Even so, before his loss of life, Las Vegas shooting survivor Danny Contreras had also claimed on social media that he’d been shot at by multiple shooters on October 1.”4
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s the deal, something is clearly going on. What that is, we have yet to figure out. However, if the feds or local police don’t want us to think something is going on, then they need to stop being so secretive. They need to get their story together. They need to address the multiple shooter issue. They need to be transparent and start answering some questions.
What do you think?

            The CIA's "Operation Cyclone" - Stirring The Hornets Nest Of Islamic Unrest Zbigniew Brzezinski not long ago revealed that on July 3, 1979, unknown to the American public and Congress, President Jimmy Carter secretly authorized half a million dollars to create an international terrorist movement that would spread Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia and "de-stabilise" the Soviet Union...
The CIA called this Operation Cyclone and in the following years poured $4 billion into setting up Islamic training schools in Pakistan (Taliban means "student").
           </p>
           <p>
            Young zealots were sent to the CIA's spy training camp in Virginia, where future members of al-Qaeda were taught "sabotage skills" - terrorism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Others were recruited at an Islamic school in Brooklyn, New York, within sight of the fated Twin Towers.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Pakistan, they were directed by British MI6 officers and trained by the SAS.
           </p>
           <p>
            The result, quipped Brzezinski, was "a few stirred up Muslims" - meaning the Taliban.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Wall Street Journal declared: "The Taliban are the players most capable of achieving peace. Moreover, they were crucial to secure the country as a prime trans-shipment route for the export of Central Asia's vast oil, gas and other natural resources."
           </p>
           <p>
            No American newspaper dares suggest that the prisoners in Camp X-Ray are the product of this policy, nor that it was one of the factors that led to the attacks of September 11.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nor do they ask: who were the real winners of September 11? 10/28/17

            Rocky Palermo was shot by a gunman in the crowd during Sunday night's mass shooting and says he has the evidence to prove it. He says there were between 3-5 active shooters firing weapons into the crowd and says there was gunfire coming from the ground as well as from above. Palermo was rushed to hospital after taking a .223 round to the pelvis and still has 30-40 pieces of bullet shrapnel still inside his body. MORE info: witnesses dying:

            save this video now and get it on HookTube now. Fuck the police. Comey &amp; Lynch Colluded with Clinton Campaign to Entrap, Wiretap Trump; Illegal Scheme Involved Entire U.S. Intel Community, Loretta Lynch’s Justice Department and James Comey’s FBI worked together with the Hillary Clinton campaign to entrap Donald Trump and associates — including his eldest son — prior to the 2016 presidential election, according to records and testimony of federal law enforcement insiders.
           </p>
           <p>
            One high ranking official in the Justice Department called it a sweeping “highly illegal” scheme to ensure Hillary Clinton’s election to the White House. “This was clearly a scheme using Justice (Department) resources and State (Department) resources to get the Russian lawyer into the United States,” one Justice Department insider said. “Who has the power to do this? Only the people at the very top.” Lynch. Comey. Andrew McCabe. Preet Bhahara. Sally Yates  the Bureau played a definitive role in plotting this sweeping privacy breach. But the FBI had much help from the NSA, CIA, the Office of of the Director of National Intelligence, Treasury financial crimes division under DHS, and the Justice Department, federal law enforcement sources confirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Brennan. James Clapper. Jeh Johnson.
           </p>
           <p>
            That places the Barack Obama administration directly into this illegal soup, led by Lynch, Yates, Comey and the FBI’s McCabe and associates. In fact, Hillary Clinton along with the DNC bankrolled Fusion GPS to set up Donald Trump Jr. in the large scheme to undercut his father’s path to the presidency, sources said. The Russian lawyer who set up Donald Trump Jr. — Natalia Veselnitskaya — was paid by Fusion GPS. Fusion GPS was paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Veselnitskaya and Fusion GPS worked together on another caper in 2014, two years before the Trump Jr. operation. In Russia. Veselnitskaya was barred from entering the United States. Federal law enforcement sources said Lynch and Comey — using Preet Bhahara’s clout in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the southern district of New York — ensured she was granted a special visa for entry, just to set up the Trump inner circle. British, MI6, Obama, FBI, DOJ, FISA, Fusion GPS, CIA fabricated the piss dossier. Boiling it down: Anti-Brexit British Establishment Elite acting as agents of the Obama FBI/DOJ infiltrated an opposition candidate's campaign, name-dropped Russia with the implication of collusion then peddled this as evidence of Russian Collusion, all while the Same MI6 operation fabricated a Russian-Based Steele Dossier meant to smear the Republican Candidate should he succeed in winning the endorsement of the American public.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL;DR This was and is an attempted coup by the US Intelligence Establishment working with British Intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should keep at the front of our minds why the Deep State/Elite Establishment in the USA and Britain both would violate so many taboos and laws in order to de-seat President Trump:TARIFFS AND Border Control. Open Borders to Chinese goods and foreign factory operations are the lynch pin for the current establishment's money train. They are vested in this unfair and destructive system of money transfer. And Open Borders to cheap labour is how they plan to continue the shift of the public from individualism and self reliance to a worshipful acceptance of state power and Big-Government welfare programs controlled, of course, by this same international elite.

            Here's most of the dots about the crime laid out on a platter for you on THE site to go for for the truth of this matter. I think many people currently and formerly at the highest levels of the CIA, FBI, DOJ, and the Senate need to go to prison... but won't of course:

            </a>
            … The Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, is demanding the FBI and DOJ must keep records from congress. According to Mark Warner, it would be “irresponsible” and “potentially illegal” for congressional oversight to keep demanding records from the FBI and DOJ about their spying and surveillance activity against the campaign of Donald Trump… wait, what? Hmm?… Methinks Senator Mark Warner has a conflict here. You see, when Dianne Feinstein stepped down as Vice-Chair from the Senate Intel Committee after the 2016 election, it was Mark Warner who took her place. This puts Warner on the Gang-of-Eight. Coincidentally, the Gang-of-Eight conduct all oversight over DOJ and FBI covert and counterintelligence operations…. including those covert actions that took place in 2016. But wait, it gets better… Senator Mark Warner was also the guy caught text messaging with DC Lawyer Adam Waldman in the spring of 2017 (his first assignment). Waldman was the lawyer for the interests of Christopher Steele – the author of the dossier. While he was working as an intermediary putting Senator Warner and Christopher Steele in contact with each-other. Simultaneously Adam Waldman was also representing the interests of… wait for it,…. Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska. Derispaska was the Russian person approached by Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok and asked to assist in creating dirt on the Trump campaign, via Paul Manafort. You see, Senator Mark Warner has a vested interest in making sure that no-one ever gets to the bottom of the 2016 political weaponization, spying and surveillance operation. Spies are rotten.

            Final part. DEEP STATE POLITICS
JUNE 20, 2017 | RUSS BAKER
WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 2 Leaning forward at his desk, a large globe next to him, his lean face bearing a look of calm intensity, George H. W. Bush looked almost presidential. The reporter for the Texas paper picked up on that. But he was equally struck by Poppy’s devotion to the sitting president. Ambassador Bush, he noted, “is loyal — some say to a fault — to President Nixon, and frequently quotes him in conversation.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the image Poppy wanted to convey. Even when the reporter asked for his own views, he quickly deferred. “I like to think of myself as a pragmatist, but I have learned to defy being labeled,” Bush said. “What I can say is that I am a strong supporter of the President.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, when someone defies being labeled, it gives him extraordinary flexibility to move in different circles, to collect information, to spin on a dime — in short, to behave a lot like a covert intelligence officer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The image of Poppy as the ultimate loyalist was one he would project for three more years — right up to the final days of the Nixon presidency. Not even Nixon, who was famously distrustful, seemed to doubt it. After winning the 1972 election in the midst of the Watergate scandal, Nixon decided to hedge his bets and clean house.
           </p>
           <p>
            Planning to fire all but his most trusted aides, Nixon instructed Ehrlichman to “eliminate everyone except George Bush. Bush will do anything for our cause.” This trust endured to the end of Nixon’s presidency.
           </p>
           <p>
            If indeed Bush was ever a Nixon loyalist, he certainly flipped the moment the tide turned. This new stance emerged with the 1974 public release of the transcript of Nixon’s smoking gun conversation with Haldeman. As Bush would record in his diary after Nixon’s final cabinet meeting, the taped conversation was irrefutable proof that “Nixon lied about his knowledge of the cover-up of the Watergate scandal… I felt betrayed by his lie… I want to make damn clear the lie is something we can’t support.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Added Poppy: “This era of tawdry, shabby lack of morality has got to end.”
           </p>
           <p>
            This purported diary entry was most likely part of Poppy’s perennial alibi trail. It could have been Bush family tradecraft, something like Barbara’s Tyler, Texas, hair salon letter from November 22, 1963 — always intended for public view. Perhaps the most revealing part is the point at which Bush summarizes the content of the smoking gun conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Poppy selectively paraphrases a tiny part of that session, making it look as if Nixon had ordered Haldeman (as Bush put it) to “block the FBI’s investigation of the Watergate break-in.” This, Poppy asserted, “was proof [that] the President had been involved, at least in the cover-up.”
           </p>
           <p>
            What Poppy omitted were two key things:
           </p>
           <p>
            (1) That it was actually John Dean’s suggestion, not Nixon’s, to block the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) That the CIA was at the center of the intrigue to begin with.

            DEEP STATE POLITICS
JUNE 20, 2017 | RUSS BAKER
WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 2. Continued. It is in this context that we consider a June 1963 letter from Nixon to Kendall, then still running Pepsi’s foreign operations. A researcher working for me found it in Nixon’s presidential library archives; it appears to be previously unpublished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dear Don:
           </p>
           <p>
            In view of our discussion yesterday morning with regard to Cuba, I thought you might like to see a copy of the speech I made before the American Society of Newspaper Editors in which I directed remarks toward this problem. When I return from Europe I am looking forward to having a chance to get a further fill-in with regard to your experiences on the Bay of Pigs incident.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dick
           </p>
           <p>
            The letter rings a little odd. Nixon and Kendall were close, and more than two years had passed since the Bay of Pigs; it was unlikely that this would be the first chance Nixon got to discuss the subject with his friend. Furthermore, Kendall is not known to have had any “experiences” in relation to the invasion.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a 2008 interview, Kendall, by then 87 years old but still maintaining an office at Pepsi and seeming vigorous, said that he could not recall the letter nor provide an explanation for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given this, the use of the phrase in the letter appears to be some form of euphemism between friends, a sort of discreet wink. Nixon, the former coordinator of covert operations under Ike, clearly knew that Kendall was more than a soda pop man. Nixon’s experiences representing Pepsi instilled in him a lasting — and not altogether favorable — impression of what he acidly termed “the sugar lobby.” Haldeman got the message that treading carefully was wise. Some of his notes are intriguing in this respect. He urges special counsel Charles Colson:
           </p>
           <p>
            0900 Cols[on] — re idea of getting pol. Commitments — Sugar people are richest &amp; most ruthless before we commit — shld put screws on &amp; get quid pro quo ie Fl[anigan] — always go to Sugar lobby or oil etc. before we give them anything
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA also knew the soft drink industry well. The agency used bottling plants, including those run by Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and other companies, for both cover and intelligence. Moreover, the local bottling franchises tended to be given to crucial figures in each country, with ties to the military and the ruling elites. It was not just bottlers that played such a role; there were marketing monopolies for all kinds of products, from cars to sewing machines, given out on recommendations of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kendall was a close friend of the Bush family and a fellow resident of Greenwich, Connecticut. In 1988, he would serve in the crucial position of finance chairman for Poppy Bush’s successful run for the presidency. His support for the Bushes included donating to George W. Bush’s 1978 Midland congressional campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            And as noted by The New York Times, Kendall was identified with the successful effort to overthrow the elected democratic socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the Times would report in July 1976:
           </p>
           <p>
            One of Mr. Kendall’s great passions is international trade, and his interest in foreign affairs won him a footnote in a 1975 interim report of a Senate Select Committee. The report was called “Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders,” and discussed in part the assassination of Salvador Allende Gossens, the Marxist Chilean president who was killed in 1973.
           </p>
           <p>
            The report stated that Mr. Kendall had requested in 1970 that Augustin Edwards, who was publisher of the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, as well as a Pepsi bottler in Chile, meet with high Nixon Administration officials to report on the political situation in Chile. (Pepsi bottling operations were later expropriated by the regime.) That meeting, which included Mr. Kendall, Mr. Edwards, Henry Kissinger and John N. Mitchell, was indeed held, and later the same day, Mr. Nixon met with Dr. Kissinger and Richard Helms, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Helms later testified that President Nixon had ordered at the follow-up meeting that Chile was to be saved from Allende “and he didn’t care much how.” Mr. Kendall says he sees nothing sinister, or for that matter even controversial, in his action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like many on the right, quite a few bottlers regarded the Kennedy administration’s policy toward Castro’s Cuba as dangerously soft. Declassified FBI files show that, after Kennedy’s death, one man contacted the FBI regarding threatening remarks that his brother, a bottler, had made in reference to the president.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another convention attendee was identified in FBI reports as having had a drink with Jack Ruby, the assassin of Lee Harvey Oswald, on the night of November 21.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though unhappy with Kennedy, these independent businessmen clearly wanted to hear what Johnson had to say, which is why the Texas-born vice president was the convention’s keynote speaker.
           </p>
           <p>
            By some estimates, the convention included close to 8,000 bottlers — so many, in fact, that it had taken over Dallas’s largest venue, the new Market Hall. This meant that when Kennedy’s trip planners determined where he would speak on November 22, one of the very few sufficiently large and central venues had long since been taken. The Dallas Trade Mart thereby became the most likely location for Kennedy’s speech, with the route through downtown to the Trade Mart, past the Texas School Book Depository, as the most likely for the presidential motorcade.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the Trade Mart was secured by that most unlikely group of “friends” of JFK, the Dallas Citizens Council, whose members’ views were described by The New York Times as “very conservative and range rightward.” The council had co-sponsored the luncheon as a putative peace offering to JFK. Indeed, it seems that JFK’s itinerary in Dallas was circumscribed by the bottlers and the Citizens Council. The mere fact that 8,000 strangers had poured into Dallas in the days before JFK’s arrival should presumably have been of interest, yet the Warren Commission ignored the event altogether.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting thing about the bottlers’ convention is that the Army Reserves volunteered to help facilitate an unusual extracurricular activity. As noted in chapters 6 and 7, Poppy Bush’s friend Jack Crichton was head of a local Army Intelligence unit. Associates of Crichton’s who were involved
           </p>
           <p>
            with the Army Reserves had managed to get into the pilot car of Kennedy’s procession, with one as the driver. Crichton would also provide the interpreter for Marina Oswald after her husband’s arrest as the prime suspect in Kennedy’s murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to a short item in the Dallas Morning News the day before Kennedy was shot, members of the Dallas unit of the 90th Artillery Division of the Army Reserve would be providing trucks and drivers to transport 200 orphans to a livestock arena for a rodeo sponsored by the bottlers’ group. This was to take place at nine P.M. on the night before Kennedy’s arrival.
           </p>
           <p>
            The arena was at Fair Park, near the site under which Crichton’s Dallas Civil Defense maintained its underground emergency bunker and communications facility. Putting aside the Dickensian aspect of moving orphans in Army trucks within an affluent American city, this raises some questions about the reason for this odd maneuver. Whatever the true purpose of a small platoon of Army vehicles being permitted to move about Dallas on purportedly unrelated civilian business as the president’s arrival was imminent, it appears investigators never considered this incident worthy of a closer look.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cumulatively, the bottlers’ convention was responsible for a number of curious circumstances that may be said to have some relevance to the events surrounding Kennedy’s death:
           </p>
           <p>
            •  The convention brought Nixon to Dallas.
           </p>
           <p>
            •  It brought 8,000 strangers to Dallas.
           </p>
           <p>
            •  It sent army vehicles into action on city streets the night before the assassination.
           </p>
           <p>
            •  Its early reservation of one large venue helped determine Kennedy’s ultimate destination and thus the motorcade route.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any event, as Nixon’s adviser Stephen Hess has recounted, the former vice president emerged deeply shaken about the timing of his Dallas visit. It served to remind him that if he ever occupied the Oval Office, he too could be vulnerable and targeted — by the very same players. And his presence in this incriminating spot was suggestive of wheels within wheels, to which he of all people would have been alert.
           </p>
           <p>
            Were these intrigues what fueled President Nixon’s obsession with the CIA and its cloak-and-dagger activities in the Kennedy era? This little-noted tug-of-war, a struggle over both current policy and past history, would become an ongoing theme throughout Nixon’s term in office.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Loyalist in Chief
.
At one time, Poppy Bush had worked hard to position himself as Richard Nixon’s most loyal servant. An example appeared in a 1971 profile of Poppy in his role as Nixon’s United Nations ambassador. Under the banner headline “Bush Working Overtime,” the Dallas Morning News of September 19,1971, portrayed the ambassador as poised at the center of world affairs.

WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 2 We are running this series because people are looking back at Watergate as a guide from another time, when another president was on the ropes. And we are running it because, as is often the case, the media did not truly investigate what went on, or why. They, along with so-called historians, continue to perpetuate basic falsehoods about what transpired during that epic scandal, what Nixon actually did and said — and they ignored intriguing evidence suggesting the real reason he was removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            We recommend you start with Part 1. Here, in Part 2, we look at the remarkable fact that Richard Nixon was present in Dallas on November 22, 1963 when his 1960 vanquisher, John F. Kennedy, was violently removed from office. Is it preposterous to wonder if Nixon’s presence there was engineered?  Was it to teach him a lesson?

            A Little Exposure Never Hurts
Something had been gnawing at Nixon since November 22, 1963. Why had he ended up in Dallas the very day the man who he believed had stolen the presidency from him was shot? Nixon had been asked to go there just a few weeks before, for the rather banal purpose of an appearance at a Pepsi-Cola corporate meeting — coinciding with a national soda pop bottlers’ convention. The potential implications could not have been lost on this most shrewd and suspicious man.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon was no shrinking violet in Dallas. He called a press conference in his hotel suite on November 21, the day before Kennedy’s murder, criticizing Kennedy’s policies on civil rights and foreign relations but also urging Texans to show courtesy to the president during his visit.
           </p>
           <p>
            More significantly, he declared his belief that Kennedy was going to replace Vice President Johnson with a new running mate in 1964. This was an especially incendiary thing to say, since the whole reason for Kennedy’s visit was to cement his links to Texas Democrats, help bridge a gap between the populist and conservative wings of the state party, and highlight his partnership with Johnson. Nixon’s comment was hot enough that it gained a place in the early edition of the November 22 Dallas Morning News, under the headline,
           </p>
           <p>
            “Nixon Predicts JFK May Drop Johnson.”
           </p>
           <p>
            This was likely to get the attention of Johnson, who would be in the motorcade that day — and of conservatives generally, the bottlers included, whom Johnson had addressed as keynote speaker at their convention earlier in the week. Nixon had finished his business and left the city by 9:05 on the morning of the twenty-second, several hours before Kennedy was shot. He learned of the event on his arrival back in New York City. Like most people, he no doubt was shocked and perhaps a bit alarmed. Many people, Nixon included, believed that Kennedy had stolen the presidential election in 1960 by fixing vote counts in Texas and Illinois.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the very least, the appearance of Nixon’s November 21 press conference remarks in the newspaper just hours before Kennedy’s death was a stark reminder of the large and diverse group of enemies, in and out of politics, that JFK had accumulated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Certainly, Nixon himself was sensitive to the notion that his appearance in Dallas had somehow contributed to Kennedy’s bloody fate. According to one account, Nixon learned of the assassination while in a taxi cab en route from the airport. He claimed at the time and in his memoirs that he was calm, but his adviser Stephen Hess remembered it differently. Hess was the first person in Nixon’s circle to see him that day in New York, and he recalled that “his reaction appeared to me to be, ‘There but for the Grace of God go I.’ He was very shaken.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As Hess later told political reporter Jules Witcover:
           </p>
           <p>
            “He had the morning paper, which he made a great effort to show me, reporting he had held a press conference in Dallas and made a statement that you can disagree with a person without being discourteous to him or interfering with him. He tried to make the point that he had tried to prevent it…  It was his way of saying, ‘Look, I didn’t fuel this thing.’ ”
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon’s presence in Dallas on November 22, 1963, along with LBJ’s — and Poppy Bush’s quieter presence on the periphery — created a rather remarkable situation. Three future presidents of the United States were all present in a single American city on the day when their predecessor was assassinated there. Within days, a fourth — Gerald Ford — would be asked by LBJ to join the Warren Commission investigating the event. Bottled Up

Nixon’s unfortunate timing resulted from a series of events that seem, in retrospect, almost to have benefited from a guiding hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            In mid-1963, friends had persuaded him that his long-term prospects required a move from California, where he had lost the 1962 race for the governorship. Now that he was a two-time loser, Nixon’s best hope, they counseled, was to find a position in New York that would pay him handsomely, and let him politick and keep himself in the public eye. His friend Donald Kendall, the longtime head of Pepsi’s international operations, offered to make him chairman of the international division. But the consensus was that a law firm job would suit him better, so he joined the firm of Mudge, Stern, Baldwin, and Todd. Kendall sweetened the deal by throwing the law firm Pepsi’s lucrative legal business. In September, Kendall himself was promoted to head the entire Pepsi company.
           </p>
           <p>
            On November 1, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam, a corrupt anti-Communist, was overthrown and assassinated. On November 7, Nixon wrote to GOP strategist Robert Humphreys, expressing outrage over Diem’s death and blaming the Kennedy administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Our heavy-handed complicity in his murder can only have the effect of striking terror in the hearts of leaders of other nations who presumably are our friends.” Historians disagree on what exactly Kennedy knew about Diem’s death, though Kennedy registered shock at the news — just as he had when Patrice Lumumba, the Congolese independence leader, was assassinated in 1961. Kennedy realized that he could be blamed. Later on, it would be established by the Senate Intelligence Committee that the CIA had been attempting to kill Lumumba. Also of interest is a little-noticed comment made by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966, caught by his own recording equipment, in which he declared about Diem:
           </p>
           <p>
            “We killed him. We all got together and got a god-damn bunch of thugs and assassinated him.”
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not clear whom he meant by “we.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Kendall asked Nixon to accompany him to Dallas for the Pepsi corporate gathering coinciding with the bottlers’ convention in late November. The convention was an important annual event for Pepsi, and so would have been on Kendall’s schedule for a while, though the necessity of Nixon’s presence is less apparent. And with LBJ as keynote speaker, and appearances by Miss USA, Yogi Berra, and Joan Crawford, Nixon, the two-time loser, did not even appear at the convention.
           </p>
           <p>
            For his part, Nixon seems to have agreed to go because it was an opportunity to share the limelight surrounding Kennedy’s visit. And since Nixon was traveling as a representative of Pepsi, and flying on its corporate plane — something noted in the news coverage — Kendall was getting double duty out of Nixon’s play for media attention. That was something Kendall understood well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Donald Kendall was, like Nixon and Poppy Bush, a World War II Navy vet who had served in the Pacific. But instead of politics, he had gone into the business world, joining the Pepsi-Cola company and rising quickly through the ranks. Like Nixon and Bush, he was enormously ambitious. And in his oversight of Pepsi operations abroad, he also shared something else with them: a deep concern about Communist encroachment — which was just about everywhere. Plus Kendall had a passion for covert operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kendall’s particular reason for being interested in Cuba was sugar, for many years a key ingredient of Pepsi-Cola. Cuba was the world’s leading supplier; and Castro’s expropriations, and the resulting U.S. embargo, had caused chaos in the soft drink industry. (It also had affected the fortunes of Wall Street firms such as Brown Brothers Harriman, which, as noted in chapter 3, had extensive sugar holdings on the island.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, articles from the Dallas papers anticipating the bottlers’ convention talked openly about all these problems with Cuba. One of the articles, titled “Little Relief Seen for Sugar Problem,” explains the pressure felt by soft drink bottlers in light of a crisis concerning high sugar prices. The president of a major New York-based sugar company is quoted explaining why the crisis had not yet been averted: “The government probably thought the Castro regime might be eliminated.”

            WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 1
Excerpt From Family of Secrets By Russ Baker. Continued. Nixon had many reasons to be interested in the events of the early 1960s. As noted, he had been the “action officer” for the planning of the Bay of Pigs and the attempt to overthrow Castro. But even more interestingly, Nixon had, by coincidence, been in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and had left the city just hours before the man he barely lost to in 1960 had been gunned down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Five years after the Kennedy assassination, as Richard Nixon himself assumed the presidency, one of his first and keenest instincts was to try to learn more about these monumental events of the past decade.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both of Nixon’s chief aides, Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, noted in their memoirs that the president seemed obsessed with what he called the “Bay of Pigs thing.” Both were convinced that when Nixon used the phrase, it was shorthand for something bigger and more disturbing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon did not tell even those closest to him what he meant.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Nixon referred to the Bay of Pigs, he could certainly have been using it as a euphemism, because any way one thought about it, it spelled trouble. The Bay of Pigs invasion itself had been a kind of setup of another president.
           </p>
           <p>
            JFK had made clear that he would not allow U.S. military forces to be used against Castro. When the invasion by U.S.-backed Cuban exiles failed, the CIA and the U.S. military hoped this would force Kennedy to launch an all-out invasion. Instead, he balked, and blamed Dulles and his associates for the botched enterprise, and, to their astonishment, forced them out of the agency. As noted in chapter 4, these were the roots of the hatred felt by Hunt, Dulles, and the Bush family toward Kennedy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon was keenly aware that Kennedy’s battle with powerful internal elements had preceded JFK’s demise. After all, governments everywhere have historically faced the reality that the apparatus of state security might have the chief of state in its gun sights — and that it certainly possesses the ability to act.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, Richard Nixon was a curious fellow. Within days of taking office in 1969, Nixon had begun conducting an investigation of his own regarding the turbulent and little-understood days leading up to the end of the Kennedy administration. He had ordered Ehrlichman, the White House counsel, to instruct CIA director Helms to hand over the relevant files, which surely amounted to thousands and thousands of documents. Six months later, Ehrlichman confided to Haldeman that the agency had failed to produce any of the files.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Those bastards in Langley are holding back something,” a frustrated Ehrlichman told Haldeman. “They just dig their heels in and say the President can’t have it. Period. Imagine that. The Commander-in-Chief wants to see a document and the spooks say he can’t have it . . . From the way they’re protecting it, it must be pure dynamite.” Nixon himself then summoned Helms, who also refused to help. Helms would later recall that Nixon “asked me for some information about the Bay of Pigs and I think about the Diem episode in Vietnam and maybe something about Trujillo in the Dominican Republic” — all events involving the violent removal of foreign heads of state.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fidel Castro had managed to survive not only the Bay of Pigs but also multiple later assassination attempts. Diem and Trujillo were not so fortunate. And President Kennedy, who made a lot of Cuban enemies after the botched Bay of Pigs operations, had also succumbed to an assassin’s bullet. This was a legacy that might well seize the attention of one of Kennedy’s successors.
           </p>
           <p>
            The explosiveness of the mysterious “Bay of Pigs thing” became abundantly apparent on June 23, 1972, the day Nixon instructed Haldeman to tell CIA director Helms to rein in the FBI’s Watergate investigation. Recalled Haldeman:
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I played Nixon’s trump card. “The President asked me to tell you this entire affair may be connected to the Bay of Pigs, and if it opens up, the Bay of Pigs might be blown . . .”
           </p>
           <p>
            Turmoil in the room, Helms gripping the arms of his chair, leaning forward and shouting, “The Bay of Pigs had nothing to do with this. I have no concern about the Bay of Pigs.” . . . I was absolutely shocked by Helms’ violent reaction. Again I wondered,what was such dynamite in the Bay of Pigs story?
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon made clear to his top aides that he was not only obsessed with the CIA’s murky past, but also its present. He seemed downright paranoid about the agency, periodically suggesting to his aides that covert operatives lurked everywhere. And indeed, as we shall see, they did.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all likelihood, the practice of filling the White House with intelligence operatives was not limited to the Nixon administration, but an ongoing effort.
           </p>
           <p>
            To the intelligence community, the White House was no different than other civil institutions it actively penetrated. Presidents were viewed less as elected leaders to be served than as temporary occupants to be closely monitored, subtly guided, and where necessary, given a shove.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the CIA was in fact trying to implicate Nixon in Watergate (and, as we shall see, in other illegal and troubling covert operations), the goal might have been to create the impression that the agency was joined at the hip with Nixon in all things. Then, if Nixon were to pursue the CIA’s possible role in the assassination of Kennedy, the agency could simply claim that Nixon himself knew about these illegal acts, or was somehow complicit in them.

            WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 1
Excerpt From Family of Secrets By Russ Baker. Continued. Nixon’s memoirs, combined with the tape of June 23, make clear that Nixon recognized certain things about the implementation of the burglary.
           </p>
           <p>
            The caper was carried out by pros, yet paradoxically was amateurish, easily detected — an instigation of the crime more easily pinned on someone else. A break-in at Democratic Party headquarters: On whom would that be blamed? Well, who was running against a Democrat for reelection that fall? Why, Richard Nixon of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon, who frequently exhibited a grim and self-pitying awareness of how he generally was portrayed, might have grasped how this would play out publicly. Dick Nixon: ruthless, paranoid, vengeful — Tricky Dick. Wouldn’t this burglary be just the kind of thing that that Dick Nixon — the “liberal media’s” version of him — would do? Nixon’s opponent, George McGovern, made this charge repeatedly during the 1972 campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though Nixon would sweep the election, it would become increasingly apparent to him that, where Watergate was concerned, the jury was stacked. The path was set. Someone had him in a corner.
           </p>
           <p>
            But who?
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people, including those within Nixon’s own base of support, were not happy with him — even from early in his administration. As Haldeman noted in his diary, one month after the inauguration in 1969:
           </p>
           <p>
            Also got cranking on the political problem. [President’s] obviously concerned about reports (especially Buchanan’s) that conservatives and the South are unhappy. Also he’s annoyed by constant right-wing bitching, with never a positive alternative. Ordered me to assemble a political group and really hit them to start defending us, including Buchanan… [and political specialist Harry] Dent.
           </p>
           <p>
            There would be growing anger in the Pentagon about Nixon and Kissinger’s secret attempts to secure agreements with China and the Soviet Union without consulting the military. And there were the oilmen, who found Nixon wasn’t solid enough on their most basic concerns, such as the oil depletion allowance and oil import quotas.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the burglary crew, Nixon recognized them instantly, because he knew what they represented. While serving as vice president, Nixon had overseen some covert operations and served as the “action officer” for the planning of the Bay of Pigs, of which these men were hard-boiled veterans.
           </p>
           <p>
            They had been out to overthrow Fidel Castro, and if possible, to kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon had another problem. These pros were connected to the CIA, and as we shall see, Nixon was not getting along well with the agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            He had no way of knowing that, two years later, his conversation with Haldeman would be publicly revealed and construed as that of a man in control of a plot — rather than the target of one.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the main reasons we fundamentally misunderstand Watergate is that the guardians of the historical record focused only on selected parts of Nixon’s taped conversations, out of context. Consider a widely cited portion of a June 23 meeting tape, which would become known forever as the “smoking gun” conversation:
           </p>
           <p>
            HALDEMAN: The way to handle this now is for us to have [CIA deputy director Vernon] Walters call [FBI interim director] Pat Gray and just say, “Stay the hell out of this… this is ah, business here we don’t want you to go any further on it.”
           </p>
           <p>
            NIXON: Um hum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Short excerpts like this seem especially damning. This one sounds right off the bat like a cover-up — Nixon using the CIA to suppress an FBI investigation into the break-in.
           </p>
           <p>
            But these utterances take on a different meaning when considered with other, less publicized parts of the same conversation. A prime example: Haldeman went on to tell Nixon that Pat Gray, the acting FBI director, had called CIA director Richard Helms and said,
           </p>
           <p>
            “I think we’ve run right into the middle of a CIA covert operation.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Although the first excerpt above sounds like a discussion of a cover-up, when we consider the information about the CIA involvement, it begins to seem as if Nixon is not colluding.
           </p>
           <p>
            He may well have been refusing to take the rap for something he had not authorized — and certainly not for something that smelled so blatantly like a trap. Nixon would have understood that if the FBI were to conduct a full investigation and conclude that the break-in was indeed an illegal operation of the CIA, it would all be blamed squarely on the man who supposedly had ultimate authority over both agencies — him.
           </p>
           <p>
            And doubly so, since the burglars and their supervisors were tied not just to the CIA but also directly back to Nixon’s reelection committee and the White House itself. Yet, however concerned Nixon certainly must have been at this moment, he played it cool. He concurred with the advice that his chief of staff was passing along from the counsel John Dean, which was to press the CIA to clean up its own mess.
           </p>

            If the CIA was involved, then the agency would have to ask the FBI to back off. The CIA itself would have to invoke its perennial escape clause — say that national security was at stake. This must have sounded to Nixon like the best way to deal with a vexing and shadowy situation.

            He had no way of knowing that, two years later, his conversation with Haldeman would be publicly revealed and construed as that of a man in control of a plot — rather than the target of one.

            Sniffing Around the Bay of Pigs
.
How could Nixon have so quickly gotten a fix on the Watergate crew? He might have recognized that the involvement of this particular group of Cubans, together with E. Howard Hunt — and the evidence tying them back to the White House — was in part a message to him. One of the group leaders, G. Gordon Liddy, would even refer to the team as a bunch of “professional killers.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, several of this Bay of Pigs circle had gone to Vietnam to participate in the assassination-oriented Phoenix Program; as noted in chapter 7, Poppy Bush and his colleague, CIA operative Thomas Devine, had been in Vietnam at the peak of Phoenix, and Bush had ties to at least some from this émigré group.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Nixon recognized this tough gang, but this time, they weren’t focused on Fidel Castro — they were focused on Dick Nixon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hunt was a familiar figure from the CIA old guard. A near contemporary of Poppy Bush’s, but at Brown, Hunt had, as noted in earlier chapters, gone on to star in numerous agency foreign coup operations, including in Guatemala. He had worked closely with Cuban émigrés and had been in sensitive positions at the time John F. Kennedy was murdered and Lee Harvey Oswald named the lone assassin. Moreover, Hunt had been a staunch loyalist of Allen Dulles, whom Kennedy had ousted over the failed Bay of Pigs invasion; he allegedly even collaborated on Dulles’s 1963 book, The Craft of Intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hunt was one connected fellow, and his presence in an operation of this sort, particularly with veterans of the Cuba invasion, was not something to pass over lightly. Nixon had further basis for viewing the events of Watergate with special trepidation. From the moment he entered office until the day, five and a half years later, when he was forced to resign, Nixon and the CIA had been at war. Over what? Over records dating back to the Kennedy administration and even earlier.

            WATERGATE AND THE DOWNING OF NIXON, PART 1
Excerpt From Family of Secrets By Russ Baker. With President Donald Trump and his administration facing investigation by a special counsel, we increasingly see parallels being drawn with Watergate, and the investigation and removal of Richard Nixon. Perhaps that is why I am hearing a lot of interest in the discoveries I made in the course of research for my book Family of Secrets.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I found — what totally blew me away — was that almost everything I thought I knew about Watergate… was wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            And I found it in the most improbable way: studying another president, or presidential clan, the Bushes. I found evidence of involvement by the Bushes in a host of covert activities that have been little explored and little understood over the years. I found evidence that George H.W. Bush (“Bush 41”) had been secretly involved in work for the Central Intelligence Agency for decades before he was named the outfit’s director.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bush was part of the Nixon Administration, but I discovered what appeared to be evidence he had been involved in a plot to remove the president.
           </p>
           <p>
            This brings to mind claims that “deep state” elements are seeking to undo Donald Trump. Given Trump’s own track record, it’s hard to see how it would require the machinations of enemies to seal his doom. Nonetheless, the question of how elements of the dominant establishment — including allies in intelligence agencies, the military, and high finance, might move against a president it viewed as threatening to “US interests” (or their own) — is an intriguing one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Irrespective of what fate one prefers for Trump, the real story behind the fate of another American president — whose tale of an iconic Shakespearean downfall turns out to be shaky at its core — is fascinating.

            Downing Nixon, Part I: The Setup
.
Who Will Rid Me of This Troublesome Priest?
           </p>
           <p>
            —ascribed to Henry II
           </p>
           <p>
            On June 17, 1972, a group of burglars, carrying electronic surveillance equipment, was arrested inside the Democratic National Committee offices at 2650 Virginia Avenue, NW, in Washington, D.C., the Watergate building complex. The men were quickly identified as having ties to the Nixon reelection campaign and to the White House.
           </p>
           <p>
            Though at the time the incident got little attention, it would snowball into one of the biggest crises in American political history, define Richard Nixon forever, and drive him out of the White House. Most historical accounts judge Nixon responsible in some way for the Watergate burglary — or at least for an effort to cover it up. And many people believe Nixon got what he deserved.
           </p>
           <p>
            But like other epic events, Watergate turns out to be an entirely different story from an the one we thought we knew. Hanky-Panky, Cuban-Style
.
Almost no one has better expressed reasons to doubt Nixon’s involvement than Nixon himself. In his memoirs, Nixon described how he learned about the burglary while vacationing in Florida, from the morning newspaper. He recalled his reaction at the time:
           </p>
           <p>
            “It sounded preposterous. Cubans in surgical gloves bugging the DNC! I dismissed it as some sort of prank… The whole thing made so little sense. Why, I wondered. Why then? Why in such a blundering way…  Anyone who knew anything about politics would know that a national committee headquarters was a useless place to go for inside information on a presidential campaign. The whole thing was so senseless and bungled that it almost looked like some kind of a setup.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon was actually suggesting not just a setup, but one intended to harm him. Perhaps because anything he might say would seem transparently self-serving, this claim received little attention and has been largely forgotten.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notwithstanding Nixon’s initial reaction to the news of the break-in, less than a week later he suddenly learned more — and this gave him much to ponder. On June 23, Nixon’s chief of staff, H. R. “Bob” Haldeman, came into the Oval Office to give the president an update on a variety of topics, including the investigation of the break-in. Haldeman had just been briefed by John Dean, who had gotten his information from FBI investigators.
           </p>
           <p>
            HALDEMAN: …The FBI agents who are working the case, at this point, feel that’s what it is. This is CIA….
           </p>
           <p>
            Nixon’s response would show that he had already realized this:
           </p>
           <p>
            NIXON: Of course, this is a, this is a [E. Howard] Hunt [operation, and exposure of it] will uncover a lot of things. You open that scab there’s a hell of a lot of things and that we just feel that it would be very detrimental to have this thing go any further. This involves these Cubans, Hunt, and a lot of hanky-panky that we have nothing to do with ourselves… This will open the whole Bay of Pigs thing…
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, it is important to remember that Nixon knew every word he uttered was being recorded. Like his predecessors Kennedy and Johnson, he had decided to install a taping system so that he could maintain a record of his administration. He was, in a way, dictating a file memo for future historians.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that doesn’t make everything he said untrue. While Nixon undoubtedly spun some things, he still had to communicate with his subordinates, and the tape was rolling while he was trying to run the country. Those were actual meetings and real conversations, tape or no tape. And though the result was 3,700 hours of White House tape recordings, Nixon evinced merely sporadic consciousness of the fact that the tape was rolling. Only after his counsel John Dean defected to the prosecutors did Nixon appear to be tailoring his words.

When a 911 operator asked the caller if she saw the shooter, the woman who was inside the Route 91 venue at the time replied: “I think we saw the guy flying in a helicopter. […] You guys need officers in the sky because he’s flying in a helicopter.” (Keep in mind the LVMPD helicopter did not show up anywhere near the vicinity until 10:25 pm)

it's called the "high incident project". they want to make the american public think that places with extremely high security aren't safe. they are trying to create more regulations. you will see laws proposed within the next few years to put up more metal detectors and other security devices. media and politicians will be saying places with lots of police need even more police. i can't guarantee anything will happen tomorrow but las vegas is on their minds.

if their plan is successful state of nevada will pass a law in the future making all casinos have mandatory metal detectors and backscatter machines. soon after a federal law will be passed to put these machines in universities, high schools, federal buildings, you name it. osi systems and chertoff are the main producers of these machines. sometime around 2020 chertoff and osi will merge into a single company. after they merge the owners will sell off all their stock and make billions in profit. mr chertoff has been in contact with sheldon adelson. mr adelson will become a huge sponsor of these machines and he will be the first to put them in his casinos when the law passes. this is my last message for now. don't expect me to return anytime soon -john

            And here's another scary prediction/warning posted 24 hours before the FBI obviously and clearly committed a Gladio North Woods style attack out in a church in Texas. 27 shooters in one casino in Vegas and 27 dead victims in the church in Texas well god damn it it's so obvious the police/FBI are killing us now this is a civil war now. Insider here Anonymous (ID: D9w49jje 11/04/17 (Sat)02:58:35 No. 147884535 Shadow Government Trading Your Liberty For Our Secrecy. 1Fourth of November will be the day that America. 2Breaks away from the lies. 3It isn't antifa nor the Altright that brings..... 4It's going to be glorious to see you rot in hell. 5So, with this said if I die I died for a just cause. 6God I cant believe i'm leaving this hint. 7Oh well if i die i die. 8It is what it is. 9Nothing more nothing less. 10God for i'm about to die I salute you. 11Travesty is for those who never tried. 12Overcomers is where the warriors lie. 13Conquer or die is my motto. 14After all what is life after death. 15Unicorns and fairies or Jesus. 16Some cowboys like me go out like that. 17Echo for eternity king Jesus. 18Alpha and omega the beginning and the end. 19Fate is for those who are willing to go big. 20A man in the fight is far more dangerous then. 21Legions upon legions of men. 22Sound mind is key to this. 23Echo is all i hear with the gunshots. 24Fear is for those who do something dangerously. 25Legion upon legions is what i'll be fighting today. 26Allegiance to my god and country. 27Godspeed anons. When the first shots are fired later on today, be stoic, be vigilant, be diligent,. Get all the information as fast as you can and start putting it together as quickly as you can. An most of all save our country by exposing the shadow government. Godspeed Anons. L o o k a t  t h e f i r s t l e t t e r o f t h e F I r s t w o r d o n e a c h l i n e !  Remember Remember the 4th of November. Devin Patrick Kelly and the FBI killed 26 and then Devin Patrick Kelly was killed by the FBI. 27 letters = 27 victims the FBI knew exactly what it was doing and projecting what it was going to do on 11/5/17 the FBI killed 26 people on November 4 2017 and the FBI killed Devin Patrick Kelly. The FBI causes mass shootings and commits mass shootings we don't need gun and game control we need FBI control. We need to be like JFK. We need to be like Vegeta. The FBI are fools i'm going to crush them and the CIA into a million thousand pieces and throw them into the wind. F I N A L E X P L O S I O N Las Vegas came under helicopter gunship attack and there were multiple shooters all over Las Vegas and John Bielman warned the world on 4chan 3 weeks in advance and now he's dead the FBI killed him and his daughter. And another 4 chan anon warned the world the FBI would shoot up the church in Sutherland Springs Texas and the FBI did shoot up the church in Sutherland Springs Texas and killed all those people. The United States is now engaged in bloody brutal civil war against the FBI. BODY COUNT - Civil War (feat. Dave Mustaine)

            At the time I was a security guard who got to carry a PD radio. When the attack happened I heard an ATL (Attempt to locate.) For Paddocks Hyundai Santa Fe, but also for a black Dodge Ram truck. Never again heard a word about the black dodge ram. I always thought that was weird.

            I thought it would be about 12 shooters based on what I saw before - but this now looks a lot more like 50+.  Seems they hit almost everything in the area... not to mention the mass slaughter in the concert.
           </p>
           <p>
            Member the 50 ambulances sent to the hooters?  Pretty sure they wiped out the whole restaurant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somebody conducted a major attack and it wasn't ISIS - not their style at all.  This was a military/agency/private military contractor type of operation.  They used helicopters and infantry machine guns.  They displayed urban tactical combat training.  None were captured nor killed.  It took planning and skill. ISIS really has neither.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure anything like this has ever been seen before.

            It was ISIS. They claimed it was them. Paddock was a fall guy. The CEO of MGM which owns Mandalay Bay, covered up the fact that it was a terror attack. MGM basically owns half of Vegas,they have a lot of pull. Murren the CEO was a donor to sheriff Lombardo. Most likely, MGM had no insurance coverage for terror attacks, so the lone wolf killer narrative would save them a shit load of money.

              Not very many. A few higher ups in MGM, sheriff, FBI. Which is why we will never know what really happened for sure

            This whole thing is very fishy. The most telling aspect of it was how quickly it completely disappeared from the MSM after a week.

            one thing I've always been thinking about were the smoke alarms. I don't know alot about guns, but I assume if that many rounds came from on room, meaning only Paddock as the shooter, wouldn't the smoke alarms go off after a few rounds? Hotel computer security systems would be able to tell the location of the sounding alarm. It never made sense, all the confusion of trying to find him.. I worked in a hotel in the early 2000's, and if the fire alarm went off, we knew where it was coming from instantly. Thank you for this, also for not giving up on this subject, as many have already.

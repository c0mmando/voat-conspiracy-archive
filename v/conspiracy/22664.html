<p><em>Chris Thomas: The Akashic is purely &amp; simply a memory. So everything that has ever occurred within this Universe is recorded within that universal source. I suppose you could think of the mind as having various compartments to it, in one way or another. And so what I do is I recognize the compartment that communicates with the Akashic, so I address any questions I have to that compartment.

<p>He no longer has a website due to countless hack attacks, but there are still notable content available on the interweb if you wanted to research further</p>
<p><strong>--</strong></p>
<p>It holds an honesty to him that not many people will be willing to agree with easily, so it is best to be open and to consider his information. It covers a lot of ground and can be considered esoteric in nature, so it is best to not limit the information based on your current understanding or perspective. </p>
<p><strong>--</strong></p>
<p>Be kind and do not bash if you disagree with the material, instead if you wish to denote what has been stated, please include a fair rebuttal with proper research to why you disagree. The reddit/whoaverse structure is based on online identity, which can be manipulated and manufactured at will - so the information itself is not for the opinions of such users, but for the mindful human living being. Everyone is free to think whatever they like, but I thought this was very resourceful to share with others who search for independence or information that helps piece together a stronger truth. </p>
<p><strong>--</strong></p>
<p>As for the method on which he brings this information forward, one should take time to research Edgar Cayce, Shamonic &amp; Native American practices, and other ancient balanced cultures including those in which use Sanskrit, in which the word Akasha is derived from (meaning \'air\' or \'ether\'). Again, it is suggested to do your own independent research whether you wish to find more, or wish to disagree.</p>

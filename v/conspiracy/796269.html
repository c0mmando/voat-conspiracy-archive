            Who is gonna raise their voice about being mistreated by women? Nobody takes you seriously. The media flat-out ignores this side.

             A capitol hill police officer filed charges against Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney for allegedly hitting him in the chest with a closed fist when he demanded her ID. (He claims to have not recognized her despite the fact that Capitol Hill police are required to undergo Member Recognition programs and McKinney had, at the time, been a controversial and prolific Congresswoman for the past eight years.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Anywho, the media took him seriously and ignored all the claims and allegations of ongoing racism and sexism amongst the Capitol Hill police, and even the possibility that this racism was promoted from the top down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh yeah, she was the o e who tried to impeach Bush and did all that other wonderful work bringing attention to sex trafficking D.o.D. contractors and Rumsfeld's missing trillions... Yeh.

             I think that helped get them this far but now they're in full attack mode. People are raising their voices plenty it seems and yet media of all manner are the very same corporate controlled subversion artists. In the same way, Reddit Admins gave a voice to SRS, validating their aggressions and justifying it as they were all such victims. They did that in mainstream media. Now look at it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I find those in media who do pay it lip service serve more as token opposition and don't treat it in a serious manner. Instead they hyperfocus on the low hanging fruit and miss the point completely, often all in their own self promotion, while gathering fanfare and spin momentum.

              I hope women soon come to understand their fight for equality has been undermined and taken over by The Powers That Be for their own agenda, just like the civil rights movement was literally taken out of the hands of black people because TPTB needed "the right" people (see: Claudette Colvin's story, and the founding of the NAACP). Orchestrating history, in plain sight.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just hope, as I was saying, that women figure this out soon. Though I am sure the mass sexual assaults in Europe aren't helping that case.

               If there's one thing that women are good at, particularly the dimmest amongst them, is loving being told what they want to hear. There's also the "sisterhood" indoctrination, whereby they're all conditioned to never stand against another one of them no matter how insane their transgressions. "You go gurl". "Women kicking ass".
              </p>
              <p>
               Feminism was always just a man's invention.

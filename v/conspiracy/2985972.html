            Ties to Trump transition
In 2016 Prince supported Republican candidate Donald Trump for President of the United States. Prince had no formal role in Trump's transition. In December 2016 Prince visited the transition team offices in New York City. In April 2017 as part of a broader investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating a January 11, 2017 meeting in the Seychelles at which Prince presented himself as Trump's unofficial representative.[45]
           </p>
           <p>
            In August 2016, Donald Trump Jr. had a meeting with envoy representing the crown princes of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia – Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi and Mohammad bin Salman – who offered help to the Trump presidential campaign.[46] The meeting included Prince and Joel Zamel, an Israeli specialist in social media manipulation.[47][46]

Further information on Tropicana Entertainment prior to 2010: Columbia Sussex § Casinos
In January 2007, Columbia Sussex acquired Aztar Corporation, owner of the Tropicana casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, and three other casinos, for $2.1 billion. A new subsidiary, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, was created to hold the combined company's casinos. After losing control of its largest property, the Tropicana Atlantic City, the new company was quickly forced into bankruptcy in May 2008. While in bankruptcy, the Tropicana Las Vegas was split off as a separate entity.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest of the company emerged from bankruptcy on March 8, 2010 as Tropicana Entertainment Inc., under the leadership of investor Carl Icahn.[1] On the same day, it regained control of the Tropicana Atlantic City, which Icahn and other investors had bought for $200 million in canceled debt.[2] In approving the transfer, the Casino Control Commission stressed that Tropicana was a "different company" than the company that had lost its license in 2007.[3]
           </p>
           <p>
            In March 2011, Tropicana sold the Horizon Casino in Vicksburg to a partnership of Tangent Gaming and Great Southern Investment Group, who renamed it as the Grand Station Hotel and Casino.[4][5]
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012, the company closed the Jubilee casino and consolidated its operations into the Lighthouse Point casino, which was expanded and rebranded as the Trop Casino Greenville.[6]
           </p>
           <p>
            In May 2013, Tropicana agreed to sell the River Palms for $7 million to M1 Gaming, owner of Boomtown Reno,[7] but the sale never went through. In July 2014, Tropicana instead agreed to sell the River Palms for $6.75 million to the owners of Dotty's.[8]
           </p>
           <p>
            In April 2014, Tropicana acquired Lumière Place, HoteLumière, and the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis from Pinnacle Entertainment for $260 million.[9]
           </p>
           <p>
            The company assumed management of the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City after Icahn Enterprises purchased the casino's parent company.[10]
           </p>
           <p>
            In April 2018, the company agreed to be acquired for $1.85 billion by Eldorado Resorts and Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLP). GLP would pay $1.21 billion to buy the land and buildings of Tropicana's casinos, while Eldorado would acquire Tropicana Entertainment for $640 million, and lease the casinos from GLP.[11][12] The parties later modified the deal so that the real estate of Lumière Place would be sold to Eldorado instead of to GLP.[13] The sale was completed on October 1, 2018.[14] The Tropicana Aruba was excluded from the deal and was separately sold to Icahn Enterprises.[13]

            Links to organized crime
The 1992 U.S. Senate Subcommittee 218-page report entitled "Asian Organized Crime: the New International Criminal", linked Trump's businesses to Asian organized crime.[56]
           </p>
           <p>
            Specifically the Senate subcommittee named Danny Sau Keung Leung, who had been Trump Taj Mahal's VP Foreign Marketing since 2000, as an associate of the Hong Kong-based organized crime group 14K Triad"[57] linked to "murders, extortions and heroin smuggling".[58] Leung worked at Trump Taj Mahal from 1990 to 1995.[58] He was "known by law enforcement to be linked to organized crime syndicates"[59] and was investigated by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1995 with hearings in Atlantic City regarding his "background and character".[58] "Mentions of Trump businesses" were "sprinkled throughout the 1992 Senate report on "Asian organized crime in the United States".[59] "Crime bosses who ran the Chinatown bus system put together trips to Trump businesses in Atlantic City.[59] "[O]ther people with links to organized crime booked shows at Trump venues and in 1987, one was indicted on a charge of providing kickbacks to executives at Trump Castle."[59] According to an Internal Revenue Service report cited in a 2016 Politifact article by Linda Qui,[57] Trump also worked closely with other members and associates of organized criminal enterprises, including Danny Leung, Felix Sater, Salvatore Testa, and Kenneth Shapiro".[57][60]:5 In 1984, Canadian police had identified Leung as "a major player in Toronto organized crime", yet in 1989, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission granted him the casino "key license reserved for executives"[58] and he began working for Trump Taj Mahal in 1990.[58] At the New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearing in 1994, Trump sent Taj President Dennis Gomes to "testify on Leung's behalf at the hearing New Jersey Casino Control Commission. In spite of an objection of the Division of Gaming Enforcement and the testimony of Canadian police, his casino key license was renewed. "Leung's lawyer, Guy Michael said, that the criminal allegations were "absolutely untrue. In August 2013, Leung requested to be placed on the Casino Key Employee Inactive List in August 2013 "in lieu of complying with the resubmission process".[61]:20

Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City
The Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City (former Trump Taj Mahal) is a casino and hotel on the Boardwalk, owned by Hard Rock International, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States
           </p>
           <p>
            The casino, originally known as the Trump Taj Mahal, was inaugurated by its then-owner Donald Trump in 1990, and was built at a total cost of nearly $1 billion USD. Originally Restaurants at the Taj Mahal included Hard Rock Cafe, Sultan's Feast, Dynasty, Il Mulino New York, Moon at Dynasty, and Robert's Steakhouse. It was also the home of Scores, the country's first in-casino strip club.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Taj Mahal came to the brink of closure in 2014 as its parent company went through bankruptcy, but ultimately remained open under the new ownership of Icahn Enterprises. In 2015, the Taj Mahal admitted to having “willfully violated” anti-money-laundering regulations for years and was fined $10 million. It was the highest penalty ever levied by the U.S. federal government against a casino. On August 3, 2016, it was announced that the Trump Taj Mahal would close after Labor Day, because of casino workers on strike. It was closed on October 10, 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            On March 1, 2017, the Seminole Tribe of Florida through its Hard Rock International brand, and the Morris and Jingoli families, announced its purchase of the facility and conversion to the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino brand. It reopened on June 27, 2018
           </p>
           <p>
            In February 2016, Trump Entertainment Resorts exited bankruptcy and became a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises. The casino retained the name "Trump Taj Mahal", though Donald Trump no longer held any ownership stake. In April, another Icahn affiliate, Tropicana Entertainment, took over the property under a management agreement. Icahn also stated he would withhold a planned $100-million investment into the property if New Jersey approved casinos in the northern region of the state

            Trump Taj Mahal era: 1990-2016
Construction of what was originally known as the Taj Mahal commenced in 1983 by Resorts International, owner of the neighboring Resorts Casino Hotel, with an estimated budget of $250 million.[7][8] Resorts head James Crosby said it might be named the United States Hotel, in reference to the city's first major hotel
           </p>
           <p>
            After Crosby's death in April 1986, Resorts International became a takeover target.[10] The Taj Mahal had encountered construction problems, and Crosby's heirs, lacking experience in large development projects, doubted their ability to complete it successfully. Donald Trump, who owned two other Atlantic City casinos, beat out several other bidders to purchase a controlling stake in the company for $79 million in July 1987. Trump was appointed chairman of Resorts International, and said he would complete the Taj Mahal in about a year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because New Jersey law prohibited anyone from owning more than three casinos, Trump planned to close the original Resorts casino and operate it as a hotel annex to the Taj Mahal.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the total budget had ballooned to $930 million, Resorts sought to raise $550 million to complete the Taj Mahal, but struggled to find the financing. With the company claiming to be near bankruptcy in early 1988, Trump made a tender offer to buy all outstanding stock for $22 a share, stating that he was willing to personally finance the construction, but only if he owned the entire company. Television producer Merv Griffin made an unexpected offer to purchase the company for $35 a share, sparking a highly publicized takeover battle, with Trump and Griffin filing lawsuits against each other. The two ultimately reached a settlement, which was executed in November 1988, with Griffin purchasing the company, and Trump purchasing the Taj Mahal from the company for $273 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump raised $675 million to finance the purchase and completion of the casino, primarily through junk bonds with a 14 percent interest rate.
           </p>
           <p>
            The casino opened on April 2, 1990. With 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) of gaming space, it claimed to be the largest casino in the world (though this was disputed by the Riviera), and billed itself as the "eighth wonder of the world". An elaborate grand opening ceremony was held three days later.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1991, the Taj Mahal went through a prepackaged bankruptcy, resulting in Trump giving a 50 percent stake in the business to its bondholders in exchange for lowered interest rates and a longer payoff schedule.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's new publicly traded company, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts, purchased the Taj Mahal in 1996, in a transaction that valued the property at $890 million. In the 1990s, Trump's Taj Mahal casino was "the world's largest, most flamboyant casino" and Trump took on an "enormous amount of debt" to launch it. During eighteen months after its April 2, 1990 opening, when the Casino was on the verge of bankruptcy, it became the "preferred gambling spot for Russian mobsters living in Brooklyn, according to federal investigators who tracked organized crime in New York City"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Taj Mahal was the highest grossing casino in the city until the opening of The Borgata in 2003. The Chairman Tower opened in 2008, bringing the complex to over 2,000 rooms
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2013, the Taj Mahal opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers

            On Monday, October 10, 2016, the Trump Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino was shut down after the chaos of casino workers on strike. The Hard Rock Cafe remains open.

            Hard Rock era: 2018-present

            Money laundering
Over its years of operation—1990–2016—the Trump Taj Mahal was "repeatedly cited for having inadequate money-laundering controls, not an unusual charge in the gaming business".
           </p>
           <p>
            In February 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network settled an investigation of Trump Taj Mahal with the assessment of a $10 million civil fine for "significant and long-standing money laundering violations" which were described as "willful and repeated" contraventions of the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act.[52][53] It was the highest penalty ever levied by the feds against a casino.
           </p>

            The casino agreed to periodic external audits to comply with anti-money laundering statutes, and admitted to multiple violations as part of its settlement. The U.S. Treasury made note of casino violations dating back to 1998, when Trump Taj Mahal paid a $477,700 fine for violating currency transaction requirements, as well as violations in 2003, 2010, and in 2012, for which the company was "repeatedly warned". Trump Taj Mahal was "far from meeting" standards required to protect the U.S. financial system "from exploitation from criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors", the Treasury said in a press release.

            In 2017, CNN obtained access to Treasury Department documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which included the 1998 and the 2015 settlement.

            Links to organized crime
The 1992 U.S. Senate Subcommittee 218-page report entitled "Asian Organized Crime: the New International Criminal", linked Trump's businesses to Asian organized crime.

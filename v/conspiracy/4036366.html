            Technology set into motion exponentially creates the need to maintain it, and if technology is set into motion, while a few control the many, then that also exponentially creates the need to control the access of the many to the technology of the few.
           </p>
           <p>
            The few therefore use technology to control the many, which is the main intend for the few to allow vetted access to technology for the many. The interNET, is called the world wide WEB, and was designed and still is operated by the military industrial complex for the reason of mass population control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every time you look at their screen; you ignore our reality. That is the web everyone is stuck in. never forget that. Only use technology to help maintain reality; not to ignore or even escape it. The agenda behind transhumanism is to exchange the 1 (the natural reality) with the 0 (the digital fantasy) by deceiving mankind to focus on one, while ignoring the other.

            its looking more and more likely that there might be children out there who dont know what the sun is or people are let alone the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            im seeing less images floating around of abused animals in cages and seeing more of stacks of cages with women and children in them. i dont know whos staging what but the longer i know im being lied to the bigger i know whats being hidden is.
           </p>
           <p>
            and i know there is no reason or laws here to lock down 6 million people. so whatever im being lied to about that is legit now putting
            <em>
             my
            </em>
            life at risk, its fuckin huge.

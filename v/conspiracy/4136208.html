<p><strong>Dentists say \'mask mouth\' can cause serious health complications, including strokes</strong></p>
<p><em>Dentists are warning about the health issues tied to prolonged use of a mask to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</em></p>
<p><em>They said dental problems associated with &quot;mask mouth,&quot; including gum disease, could lead to serious complications.</em></p>
<p><em>“Gum disease — or periodontal disease — will eventually lead to strokes and an increased risk of heart attacks,” Marc Sclafani, a dentist and co-founder of One Manhattan Dental, told the New York Post about “mask mouth,” which is increasingly causing inflammation and gum disease among patients.</em></p>
<p><em>Another dentist and co-founder at One Manhattan Dental, Rob Ramondi, said 50% of his patients are suffering from negative health issues due to mask-wearing.</em></p>
<p><em>“We’re seeing inflammation in people’s gums that have been healthy forever, and cavities in people who have never had them before,” Ramondi said. “About 50% of our patients are being impacted by this, [so] we decided to name it ‘mask mouth’ — after ‘meth mouth.’”</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Meth mouth&quot; is a term used to describe poor oral hygiene typically associated with chronic meth users.</em></p>
<p><em>The dentists said that the face coverings increase mouth dryness and contribute to a buildup of bad bacteria.</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mask-mouth-dentists-warn-prolonged-use-of-masks-leading-to-poor-oral-hygiene">https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mask-mouth-dentists-warn-prolonged-use-of-masks-leading-to-poor-oral-hygiene</a></p>',

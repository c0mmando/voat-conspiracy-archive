            I remember that the only reason why anyone would go to doctor was when they were sick - and sometimes the doctor came to you. They tended to live well but were seldom wealthy. Since then, we have been brainwashed into regarding doctors as "health care professionals'. Most of the "health care professionals" (doctors) that I know, two of which are family members, are quite well off. It seems that the health care business is rather lucrative - more so when diseases like cancer (and covid)go without accepted cures and the government obstructs progress while spreading faulty nutrition recommendations.

            Money, power, and social control certainly drive the “science” that is pushed on us by the MSM. They also don’t want to discuss hydroxychloroquine as a cure and preventive for the flu/covid because: 1) it is a cheap generic drug that is out of patent, 2) it would obviate the need for the their yearly patented vaccine 💉

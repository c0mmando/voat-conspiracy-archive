              Because knowing about herd immunity is shilling.
             </p>
             <p>
              Diseases that were once wiped out from general population are coming back thanks to idiots like you. I'm sure in your paranoia addled brain you think you're sticking it to some imaginary boogieman, but when children's lives are threatened  by the disinformation mill, your antics stop being funny and start to have real life consequences.
             </p>
             <p>
              If having a generation of healthy children is on the agenda of the NWO, then I fully support the NWO.

                 Polio was reclassified when the vaccine was released because the vaccine was
                 <em>
                  increasing
                 </em>

                 The polio vaccine is also responsible for causing the current soft tissue cancer epidemic amongst baby boomers.

                 ok ppl, im not super certain that some conspiracy coldnt actually be behind this forced vaccination, but honestly vaccination is something you want to do. If you know how ingenious viruses and bacteria are then you'd get why antibiotics are only temporary solutions against them and herd immunity is the way to go. Herd immunity doesn't require all of the population be vaccined but the problem is that anti-vaccine ppl tend to form "herds" of their own, which in turn can "easily" create incubators for diseases to evolve into resistant forms that then could kill millions. 
Not saying that hygiene didn't help the "extinsion of several diseases, but vaccines were the major reasons behind it.

              I don't really see how forcing people to vaccinate is any different than forcing someone to wear a helmet when they ride a bike or motorcycle. Technically, it's my body and I should be able to do whatever I want with it, but legislators have determined there are certain situations where this isn't true - that by making people do certain things, they protect others as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              By choosing not to vaccinate children, you may be limiting the choices of another child who gets sick and can't do what they want to do while they are ill.

               That's true that things like helmets are mandated to protect. But a helmet is guaranteed not to harm the wearer as soon as you put it on. It might be a different story if 1 in a 1000 helmets had a needle poking your head. If vaccines can get to a point where they are 100% effective with no adverse effects, I won't have a problem with them getting mandated. I'm not at all saying "vaccines cause autism" but I'm not sure the "cons" section is completely empty.
              </p>
              <p>
               But choosing not to vaccinate should be up to the individual as they are the ones responsible for their kids. If they feel a particular vaccination is more of a danger than it should be my choice. A parent shouldn't have to parent their kids so little Timmy down the street has a better life. They should be free to parent them in how they view is the best possible method without fear of retaliation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Though, out of legitimate curiosity, how would an unvaccinated child pose a risk to a vaccinated child? Shouldn't the vaccinated child be protected from whatever could be transmitted from the unvaccinated child?

                I mispoke; the unvaccinated children put other children who can't receive vaccines because of allergies at risk because they rely on "herd immunity".

                Everyone should be vaccinated who doesn't have allergies to the vaccine. It's pretty much an open and shut case as far as the CDC is concerned.

            <p>
             During the months of December 2014 through April 2015, the media, with the backing of Big Pharma through every possible means, changed the entire paradigm surrounding vaccination.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was a forceful push to embrace injections like no other that even spread abroad in several countries like Australia. A gullible public has now been asked to do a corporation's dirty work and point dehumanizing fingers and shame and suspicion at their neighbors and their neighbors' children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Big Pharma used every psy-weapon available to demonize opponents of forced vaccination bills like SB277 which would remove virtually all vaccine exemptions from California children.
            </p>
            <p>
             This psy-op is evidenced by
             <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2015/06/4-ways-to-spot-big-pharmas-astroturfing.html">

             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             They not only used typical witch hunt lingo and painted quite the narrative to demonize opponents of vaccination, forming a "debate" where there was none - debates usually include two willing parties and are not driven by one forceful entity - but also twisted it up by politicizing it into a

             </a>
             which created more confusing division.
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, the media tried to shame liberals and blame the middle-class educated crowd for causing disease outbreaks, even though California's children are over 97% vaccinated.
            </p>
            <p>
             They magically drove the choice over one's body into a Right issue and painted it as uneducated, stodgy and outdated. Then they pulled out the conservatives' only known black idols - Drs. Ben Carson and Thomas Sowell (educated by the Pharma/Rockefeller-funded Hoover Institute) who both suddenly came out in glowing support of vaccines.
            </p>
            <p>
             But others that are beloved in the black community had something to say about vaccines...

             No!
            </h2>
            <p>
             Louis Farrakhan and Tony Muhammad simply say No! They don't pull punches by asking for a choice. They've drawn a line in the sand, especially since whistleblowers came out with information of covered up data showing that the MMR vaccine can create higher rates of autism among young black males.
            </p>
            <p>
             Farrakhan recently spoke with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about vaccines and asked "Am I the only one?..." Meaning the only black man to speak out about forced vaccination as it applies to SB277.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Tony's epic under-the-radar speech shows more than just the long-awaited ire of the black community who don't wish for another "Tuskegee experiment" - it shows that blacks and whites are not taking the division-bait. They are not being divided and conquered.

             Last Tuesday, hundreds of rally members put aside all issues of race, creed and class to gather at California's State Capitol in peaceful protest of the bill.

             . Note: Breitbart.com is heavily pushing the vaccine agenda, so when they reported on this story, they purposely and predictably put "Nation of Islam" in the title to create diversion and division. As you can see below, no one at the event had any qualms about the speakers. Hopefully, one can see that religion was not a focal point of this event, although Biblical scriptures were alluded to for analogy.

            <p>
             For blacks and whites to unify against mandatory vaccination - and scrutinize vaccination in general - is a serious threat to Big Pharma and the global agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             How often has that type of focused demand even happened since Martin Luther King, Jr. nearly unified all classes and races of America and then the globe, against the motor behind the psychopathic oligarchy? Especially now with the race-obsessed headlines derailing people's attention from the core issues up for discussion.

              Among the political speakers was Minister Tony Muhammad, speaking on behalf of Farrakhan in this rousing speech.

            <p>
             Please
             <a href="http://www.sb277.org/">
              act now
             </a>
             and don't let the world's second largest mega-corporation conglomerate (the first is the arms industry [war]) call the shots on children's health and seal the deal for all the vaccines they have waiting in the pipeline.

             A removal of choice now is a removal of choice forever...

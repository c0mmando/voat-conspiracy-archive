           First of all Atko and Putt are MIA. Atko recently upvoted a submission which some people seem to think debunks the theory that he's MIA.

          <p>
           Now I'm not sure if this is legit or not but somebody posted screenshots of a Facebook message they received from Atko's sister that said he was " experiencing legal problems". Who knows if that's true though.

            You might not have seen, but Atko just posted about 4 hours ago.  This is a tricky situation all things considered, because if Atko is free and noy under duress, we are sort of brigading him.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, theres a lot of questions we have that probably wont be answered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Atko responded to a few of your concerns.
           </p>
           <p>
            -He doesn't think warrent canaries are effective (technically correct imo). A canary is only going to do its job if the person under gag order is highly committed to tipping the community off.
           </p>
           <p>
            -He says they dont push their updates to github immediately, which is a bit worisome. Perhaps we are all asking too much. If theyre doing hotfixes regularly, thats a lot of updates to keep up with.
           </p>
           <p>
            All things considered, he has been clear about telling up to question everything. Perhaps thats his canary, or maybe he just understands our collective paranoia.

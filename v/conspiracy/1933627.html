   Flint's water has been poisoned for 1,047 days. It will cost around $216 million to fix the pipes. The military spends that amount every 2.2 hours.

            You mean Flint has non-potable water like how most of rural America has? How fuckin tragic. Maybe if you dipshits payed your taxes and voted you could have a Mayor who gives a shit about you, or money to fix your infrastructure.

             Harsh way to put it but you hit the nail on the head. The main problem stems from blacks not paying their bills. Unfortunately the whites around them who are paying their bills are getting caught up in this.
            </p>
            <p>
             The bill payment rate is so low, this caused the administration to find a source that would save millions, unfortunately they picked a bad source that poisoned the water. I don't know what would have happened if everyone payed, since its a dem controlled city, but things like drinkable water isn't free.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's a cause and effect. If the water treatment facilities can't pay for the upkeep because blacks aren't paying their bills, let them go down to the creek and draw pails of it where they probably take a shit in it where its free.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh and the military actually serves a purpose. Stupid black people who don't pay their bills are a dime a dozen.

            Two things about this.  This is why you don't try to put potable water through unsupervised pipes and assume it to be clean on the other end (I know flint's is a problem with source).  The east coast has a higher mortality rate mostly attributed to lead.  Death is not the lead consequence of lead poisoning.  If it can kill at rate X and X can be measured it can cause other problems at rate &gt;X.  The cost of fixing it is outside of municiple means.  Most countries don't bother trying to make tap water potable because they understand that's poor economy to try to get it right (because then you have to spend even more than we do in the states seeing as we get it wrong).
           </p>
           <p>
            The second point is that if taxes went to municiple governments instead of federal governments they might have the money for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The central point is that between the insane economic costs of doing it right and what municiple budgets are you shouldn't assume things are done right.  Not just in flint.  This is like asking children to pony up the funds for a solar powered space program.  Maybe it's time to just not do that.  Take responsibility for your own drinking water.  They aren't really doing the job anyway.

           </p>
           <p>
            I remembered, related to the above that when reading The Book of Jubilees, I stumbled over this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the twenty-ninth jubilee, in the first week, [1373 A.M.] in the beginning thereof Arpachshad took to himself a wife and her name was Rasu'eja, the daughter of Susan, the daughter of Elam, and she bare him a son in the third year in this week, [1375 A.M.] and he called his name Kainam.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the son grew, and his father taught him writing, and he went to seek for himself a place where he might seize for himself a city.
            </p>
            <p>
             And he found a writing which former (generations) had carved on the rock, and he read what was thereon, and he transcribed it and sinned owing to it; for it contained the teaching of the Watchers in accordance with which they used to observe the omens of the sun and moon and stars in all the signs of heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
             And he wrote it down and said nothing regarding it; for he was afraid to speak to Noah about it lest he should be angry with him on account of it.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Sounded a bit similar.

            Synopsis:

           <p>
            Last of A_A_EL (Angel lust produced Giants) who for all of eternity will be tormented in hell for teaching man to sin. Enoch was Noah's 7th generational ancestor, his grandfather.

            It is far fetched. Symbols, any symbols, are all a form of mnemonics (or as the vatican says; demonic; learn their comms and codes).
           </p>
           <p>
            While I said it is far fetched, I'll back track just a little in order to further explain both that statement and the notion related to mnemonics.
           </p>
           <p>
            Repressed, collapsed, trauma-induced, programmed-memories can all be recalled or activated with symbols. From mk ultra through to a young person being lost in scribbles. However, it is not related to having your mind wiped. As the word is defined, it is related to memory 'recall'; either remembering your programming with regards to torture, or your repressed or forgotten memories.
           </p>
           <p>
            At their base interpretation however, they are sacred geometric symbols with regards to 'wizards' like John Dee. But in reality, they are more or less a codex and cryptographic; Crypto-GRAPHIC. Programmers borrowed the term from the 'sigils' used by alchemists and masons and vizords. John Dee signed his manuscripts with 007; Literally the inspiration for James Bond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to LMH's interview; is not reasonable that those soldiers were just traumatized by what they saw or experienced? Because that is exactly how trauma based mind control works. Shock you and force you inward.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also psychological 'powers' with regards to the Gestalt Laws. You can make someone dizzy with all kinds of intricate visuals or 'brand' them with a logo or advertisement (see how that works?).
           </p>
           <p>
            Sigils and memory arts are real, the Sistine Chapel is

            primary example of contemporary memory arts. Where as John Dee, and numerous other alchemists, scientists, and masons, used geometry related to the seasons, biology, and consciousness with nothing more than a Circle and Line.

            Or as with today's

            use; 1's and 0's = Sacred Geometry.

            My reply is not to refute LMH's claim, but to at the least, reel you back into analytic thought and contemporary knowledge without all the vatican psyop garbage. People process visual stimuli in very unique and idiosyncratic ways. Seeing bodies that appeared to be eaten would make a lot of people forget who they are.

             I do get your meaning, and I'm sure that whatever is being used in this day and age has been "slicked-up" MK-Ultra style, but who's to say all these ancient writings about the fallen don't have some validity? what if this is where the Egyptians sourced their Book of the Dead potions? Seems to me there are one class of people that gets eaten and one class that either eats people or colludes with those that eat.

             I simply recall an old grimoire saying not to stare at the sigils or magic squares too long as they lead to madness.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, John Dee was dealing with "intelligences" and I'm becoming certain that our present day intelligence agencies have been dabbling in this occult arena for far longer than they we know. Perhaps they too are speaking with intelligences to craft their cloak of invisibility over their actions so as not to be caught. Seems to have worked for a time.

                John Dee was not dealing with 'intelligences,' he was discovering things conceptually while everyone else were relying on their eyes for thinking. banning reading and writing will make a lot of people stupid unless they have innate ESP or Telepathy.

              <li>
               <p>
                He used geometry and early forms of science/alchemy to learn things from 'thin air' which was interpreted as magic by luddites and fanatics.

                If people witnessed a Tesla coil in action during the time of John Dee, they would have said he controlled lightening

              <li>
               <p>
                He may have also been communicating with ESP or Telepathy, which are proven today, and would explain his need to hide and code his work. Far more logical than demonic/satan ideologues

                Yes, agreed. Intelligence agencies work with occult knowledge. But not because they want to work with satan or hire demons. The 1700s and 1800s had published material stating all of these things in more logical and reasonable terms without the need for demons or satan. Fanatics buried it all. And the intelligences believe that it cannot be shared with amoral fanatics. Their own declassified documents state as much.

            He was asleep. The part of your brain awake while dreaming is different then the part that recognizes written word while awake.

           <p>
            Seriously try to read something while in a dream. It will be gibberish.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact reading in a dream, and knowing I cant read it causes me to lucid dream.

           We've got two elements of concern regarding this situation.

           A. It's an Antifa operation and it's being covered up by the media and authorities. There's more than one shooter, there's a rat's nest of them and the authorities are trying to keep a lid on it all.

           If this is Antifa, the left is done in this country. The media will roast for their hand in covering up for these vermin. Democrats will be extinct in a few election cycles. It could and would probably blow up into a civil war.

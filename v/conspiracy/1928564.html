             Haha apparently not, but it is important from a "this is another sign that society is breaking down". Watch the interview of her, with this really weird psychologist, her talking about her alter egos Katy and Catherine, Most twisted interview I've ever seen.

            <p>
             Politicians, sports stars and celebrities are the faces that most of us grew up watching, and most of them are either going insane in a public way, died from drugs or a suspicious suicide, or are mysteriously quiet and go into hiding.
            </p>
            <p>
             The system is breaking and most people keep going about their lives like work, shopping and drinking are the only things that matter in life, it's absolutely assanine!

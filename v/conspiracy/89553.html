            When you say CT, are you referring to conspiracy theorists, or something else?

            Banning never works. Trolls get around bans and real customers are alienated by bans. It is always better to let voating drive bad ideas and words down to oblivion or just treat normal users like adults that can move past material they find objectionable.

             Seriously, just search through the IRCR archives.  It's been going for a year so there's a lot to see.  Some obvious, some not so obvious.

              I might even be tempted to look around a bit, but tbh this issue whether true or not (and on the surface of it, it looks like it is) it's just not important to me. Perhaps that in itself is a shame. Cue sad laughter.

               I've already asked once but was shut down.  I'm serious, I'd love to talk with the users there.  No promoting TMOR or ATC unless I'm allowed to defend myself and those subs.  I won't post anything without mod approval and I'll meet whatever conditions you guys set for me.

            Are you worried that ignorant assholes are going to convince rational people that they should become ignorant assholes?  All they are accomplishing is a circlejerk with fellow ignorant assholes anyhow, so just ignore it and move on to the next comment.  It's not like they're making compelling fact-based arguments to win over the majority of readers who know comments in a thread are not always statements of empirical truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, it also isn't fair to assume someone is racist simply for pointing out an inconvenient truth since like it or not, there are still bad things like apartheid going on in the world.  While it would be great if people just stated the facts without editorializing, it's ultimately up to each of us to draw our own conclusions on whether someone else's spin on a given situation is valid, somewhat hyperbolic or straight up racism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let the spammers keep spamming - that's what the up/down arrows are for and the trolls will ALWAYS be the minority since most people on reddit or voat have the mental capacity to determine what is or isn't BS and can self-moderate the threads accordingly.

            are a homogeneous whole with a single culture or set of beliefs. Like reddit, and voat, and really any social forum, it is more complex than that.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are legitimate racists there, no doubt. People who are afraid of Jews, who see them as greedy or deceptive/manipulative, and some who believe that they secretly are devil-worshippers.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people there who do not hate Jews, but who hate Israel, or who hate the things the Israeli government does to other people.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people who are not racist, but who enjoy trolling and trying to provoke a response by pretending to be racist.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people who pose as sincere truth-seekers, and in the process express blatantly racist views in order to 1) encourage legitimately racist people to post more 2) give the entire group of people there a bad image. (see bipolarbear0 as an admitted case of this)
           </p>
           <p>
            Where the ratios for those stand, I am not certain.
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">

            has a lot of issues, like brigades and vote manipulation from places like
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
             /r/conspiratard
            </a>
            who revel in the dumbest things people can say on

             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            . It really ruins things, and you can see it in the /new/ page where serious conspiracy-related topics are buried by disinformation and fluff. The moderators have made no attempts to improve the quality or encourage more sensible conduct, but at this point there's not much they could do because such a large portion of the people active are not really interested in actually discussing conspiracy theories seriously (at least, this is what I am supposing).
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a problem that, I think, stems from not nipping crap in the bud before it began to flourish.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in short, yes there are some racists on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            and no the bulk of the people actually interested in posting there are not racist.

              is in a similar vein. It's used to lampoon and malign conspiracy theorists, that it serves to preemptively discredit anyone who considers or believes in a conspiracy theory regardless of the evidence or actual plausibility of the theory. It's really frustrating.

               Our intention with that sub is to create more of a entertaining sub rather than a sub to debate or refute anything.  Sure we mock but conspiracy theorists mock us too.  I think in this day and age you've got to have a sense of humor.  If it frustrates you then you probably need to chill and realize, almightysonofbob/mod of tmor isn't all that bad.  I don't hate conspiracy theorists...well the super crazy ones I do but I think we can all agree that some of them are batshit CRAZY.   I was conspiracy theorists aka Top Minds to feel free to have a humorous and light hearted conversation with those who disagree.  As long as they don't get super pissed I don't ban anyone.

I think perhaps my impression of the "laugh at conspiracy theorists" culture has been tainted by people like herkimer and jcm267 and nolibs, who stuck a treasure troll flair on my username when i was criticizing them for harassing behavior. I shouldn't be so prejudiced.

                I think that being able to laugh at ourselves as conspiracy theorists is a good thing. For instance, I really enjoy
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDwi4i8nmwM">
                 the videos produced by joy camp
                </a>
                , and i liked the
                <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracysatire">
                 /r/conspiracysatire
                </a>
                subreddit when it first was created. Maybe I have a persecution complex from all the jokes and ridicule about tinfoil hats and such. :P and I agree there are some definite batshit insane theories out there!
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, I'm happy to have discussed this with you. It's good to know that you aren't like some who would call us all Alex Jones fanatics and dismiss everything.

                 I understand where you're coming from.  I'm not going to sit here and say "you'll like topmindsofreddit" but just know you're welcome to enter into discussion with us just as long as you maintain that light heartedness/humor I spoke of.  All are welcome IMO.

                <p>
                 Don't forget that I used to be a conspiracy theorist and in some ways I may still be.  I just like to find a good nutty comment and have a laugh.  Or a good discussion.  Thanks for the talk buddy.  I hope to see you around.

            Sorry, I mean to add, I can tolerate the zionist conspiracies but when a users posts "jews destroying [whatever]" in the whiterights subs and then submits "zionists destroying [whatever]" in
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy

            really ticks me off.  It's just them changing the wording of their posts to not immediately raise flags.  It's their way of "going under the radar" and by radar I mean the mods.

             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            users about it and they recognize that it's happening but even they're not allowed to call the spamming racist users out about it because of some stupid rule the mods enforced.  Voat on the other hand reminds me of the

             I think it's the stuff about jewish people that the "/r/conspiracy is racist" narrative springs from. There have long been conspriacy theories about and mistrust of Jewish people, and Israel, the official country of the Jewish people, does a lot of really reprehensible things and seems to get a free pass in western media. So it's a perfect place to try to nudge people into disliking Jews on the whole or to take comments about israel out of context and say its about Jews, or to astroturf and be like "Israel slaughters innocent palestinians, this is par for the course for satan-worshipping Jews and their western media cronies" or something like that. It gets murky pretty easily unless the community on the whole is vigilant about keeping facts and hyperbole separate.

             edit: it doesn't help that Abe foxman really plays the antisemitism card anytime he can. Someone criticizes israel? Must be an antisemite. So people start thinking all or most jewish people are like him, like with the SJW fear stuff - people can support egalitarianism or the notion of respect without being feminazis. But it's easy to fall into tribalism and hatred for a group, and even easier to twist perceptions of people as being part of those hateful groups.

              Dead on buddy.  I couldn't agree more.  I don't mind seeing a conspiracy theory that involves the jews every once in a while but lately I've seen things like "Jews are using feminism and communism to push black people to kill white people".  That's just insane but I've seen it far more than I think is healthy for that subreddit.

            Honestly, why do you care? In the history of the world there has been exactly one solution to get rid of racism. That solution is empathy, forgiveness, and long suffering for the racists. Fighting them never works. Ignoring them never works. Killing them never works. Hating them never works. Hurting them never works. In the end they are usually better at fighting, ignoring, killing, hating, and especially hurting. If you want to know know what to do if you experience a racist, then learn from the example of Reverend Wade Watts. He was a black man that faced down the KKK as his neighbors. He didn't do it with pride or arrogance.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NW3RLnXmTY">
             He did it with limitless love and long suffering. In the end he converted a Grand Wizard of the KKK to give up on hate and follow Reverend Watts' example.
            </a>
            Don't let fear guide how you will treat your fellow man. Don't let pain determine your future. Instead, find the many things you have in common with racists and show compassion for them. Every man believes his actions are right. Remember, if you had the genes of the racist and had lived his or her experiences, then you would be the racist.

             I actually have.  I've made friends out of a couple of the more hardcore racist mods on reddit.  We make things fair whenever we're in each others subs, out of respect for one another.

             I completely agree.  I mock them with humor and it's worked pretty well so far.  Many hate me for getting a laugh or two out of them but a lot get it.

            Most of it is poisoning the well, like Bipolarbear, same techniques, except these people actually believe the shit they post, unlike BPB who was just doing it to move the goal posts and poison the well in order to malign the sub.

             That seems to be what they're after.  I just hate seeing it get upvoted on reddit but then the really good links or really interesting conspiracies don't get the attention they deserve.

            part of the racists, it should be mentioned, are acting deliberately like that, and may intend to darken conspiracies image in others eyes. repeat offenders have even been outed as mods of other default subreddits.

                Yeah they are to focused on setting up Muslim men with fake bombs and plans on what to do right?

                Not saying that genuine racists are not posting to that sub, but I doubt all of it is them. One would imagine an intentional brigade like that would be done with more tact then what goes on there sometimes.

                I guess it's hard for me to imagine that these people are really like that.  Then again I just remembered the video posted today of the racist kid so they are out there.

              I doubt that.  Not saying it's not possible but I think that's pushing it.  Stormfront has been caught telling it's users to go to
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              to nudge the subreddit in their favor.  That happened for real.  I've been called shill or JIDF so much I just can't take it seriously.  I'm not a shill or a JIDF either.

              I want to interject that though JIDF represents israeli astroturfing and trolling on conspiracy forums, I am not at all convinced that it is the main culprit or anything other than a joke. Hasbara is very real, and it's been admitted by israeli government agencies that they engage in it as part of a propaganda campaign.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason i mention this at all is because people like to point out that JIDF is just a joke site run by two guys or something, etc. and use that as an excuse to claim that there is no astroturfing, no hasbara going on, and that everyone who claims there is is either paranoid or racist or both and thus worthy of ignoring. That pisses me off to no end. Just want to make sure we're right about who/what we are accusing.

               I had to look up hasbara:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                refers to public relations efforts to disseminate abroad positive information about Israel. The term is used by the Israeli government and its supporters to describe efforts to explain government policies and promote Israel in the face of negative press, and to counter what they see as delegitimisation of Israel around the world. Hasbara means "explanation", and is also a euphemism for propaganda

              Thanks for that.  I'm familiar with a few of those screenshots and links.  I'm a little bummed voat is getting hit by this too but I suppose it's going to happen no matter what.  Let's hope voat stays low on the radar for a while so I can enjoy it.

            I think most of the other main subs on Reddit are way worse, and I really don't think
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            is anywhere near as bad as them. The only/main problem I have with
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            is that it's under the Reddit umbrella, and we all know what that means. I like alternatives and I very much like it here so far :)

             I also agree that there are a great many others subs that are far worse.

Ten Intentions for a Better PLANET, WHICH IS THE FOCUS
to have the code work in our lives, say it once a day</p>
<p>The First Love in Action ~ Support Life
We refrain from opposing or harming anyone. We allow others to have their own experiences. We see life in all things and honor it as if it were our own. We support life~</p>
<p>The Second Love in Action ~ Seek Truth
We follow our inner compass and discard ALL beliefs that are no longer serving us. We go to the source. We seek truth. THE TRUTH IS, LOVE IS ALL THAT EXISTS~</p>
<p>The Third Love in Action ~ Set Your Course
We begin the creative process. We give direction to our lives. We set our course~</p>
<p>The Fourth Love in Action ~ Simplify
We let go so there is room for something better to come in. We intend that we are guided, guarded, protected, and lined up with the Highest Good at all times. We trust and remain open to receive from both expected and unexpected sources. We simplify~</p>
<p>The Fifth Love in Action ~ Stay Positive
We see love, say love, and be love. We accept the gifts from all of our experiences. We are living in grace and gratitude. We stay positive.</p>
<p>The Sixth Love in Action ~ Synchronize
After intending and surrendering, we take action by following the opportunities that are presented to us. We are in the flow where Great Mystery and Miracles abide, fulfilling our MISSION and BEING what we came here to BE, LOVE EVERYWHERE PRESENT. We synchronize~</p>
<p>The Seventh Love in Action ~ Serve Others
We are Love in Action. We always have enough to share. We are available to help those who need it. We serve others~</p>
<p>The Eighth Love in Action ~ Shine Your Light
We are Magnificent Beings, Awakening to our highest potential. We express our selves with joy, smiling easily and laughing often. We shine our light~</p>
<p>The Ninth Love in Action ~ CO-CREATE
WE ASSIST IN THE CO~CREATION AND MANIFESTATION OF HEAVEN ON EARTH=HEART by envisioning THIS, THROUGH BEING CONSCIOUSNESS IN ACTION and telling others about it. We share our vision~</p>
<p>The Tenth Love in Action ~ Synergize
We see Humanity as One. We enjoy gathering with light-hearted people regularly. When we come together, we set the stage for Great Oneness to reveal itself. We synergize~</p>',

<p>Also when the guy rushed him, he just drops, not a sound. No further movement. And sure some people die almost instantly from head shots and heart shots but most of his shots are body shots.

<p>You could say they are playing dead, but when shot you\'re in so much pain, you\'re body would react to that,  its not controllable. There would be at least some people writhring in pain. But they all just drop and lay motionless. Its uncanny.</p>
<p>And then there\'s the issue of the music &quot;soundtrack&quot;. I\'m trying to figure this out because it makes no sense the more I listen to it. I have some background in audio production if it matters, not claming to be an expert, just I\'m not a complete novice.  Anyway, I heard he was using a headmount GoPro. I don\'t own a GoPro so maybe there is something I am missing here. But it seems evident the gopro is picking up all background sound. When he is driving you hear the car engine, GPS, him talking and music, all simultaneously, so that tells me he is not piping in some auxillary sound input. </p>
<p>So the music has got to be either coming from the car speakers, or from some device he is wearing like a walkman or cell phone in speakermode, which doesn\'t make sense, so I think its 99% coming from the car, but if that is the case, how is it we still hear the drummer music as he leaves the car, goes around to the trunk, goes all the way n the mosque and the music barely fades, except when he fires and then we hear it again, and sometimes the volume raises and lowers. Its crazy. This was streamed live, so how did this happen? 
And yes I realize the GoPro has some auto level limiter so when the gun fires, it would lower the input levels, and then raise them when he doesn\'t fire, but that doesn\'t explain how we can still hear the car audio all the way in the mosque. He didn\'t have the volume that loud in the car, we never see him adjust the volume in the car. We hear the drummer music in the hallway of the mosque.</p>
<p>And then the timing of the music is almost too perfect, notice the transition of music, especially when he comes out of the mosque goes back to the car, and then just as he is geting in, we hear, &quot;I am the God of Hellfire!..&quot; its almost like a soundtrack, the more you listen to it, the audio is just too perfect to be real unless it was added afterwards which means this was a production and but not actually streamed live. I don\'t know what to think about this. I\'ve been back and forth on whether this was staged or not. I\'ve been wrong on some other points and was ready to lay this to rest, but this audio is bothering me. Lets discuss honestly here.</p>',

            There's no music playing from within the mosque, otherwise we would have heard it over the drummer music in the beginning. When it switches to a new song, that same song is playing when he goes back to his car at around 9m30sec, same music, its all supposedly from his car. (In addition to the 2 key points I've listed above)

            The gunshots pretty much shatter the sound profile of anything else. It takes it quite a while to equalize.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had a GoPro hero 6 black and when I recorded some range time it was the same way. Takes it some time to get back to normal.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way the one he used was not as good as the 6 either. His video had lots of washout and grain textures.

             I appreciate your feedback, can you please look at these two areas:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Please pay attention from 6m16sec to 6m27sec in the video as he walks away from his car, turns right, and walks along the sidewalk in front of the wall, the sound from the music should be fading but it doesn't, he is walking up the sidewalk towards the front gate, there is passing car traffic the sound levels should adjust for car traffic and  partially drown out the music, but it never does, the music stays steady. Just the acoustics of walking in front of the concrete wall should change the sound but it doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Now notice how loud the music is at around 6m42sec when he is inside the mosque, compared to how loud it was at 6m12sec when he was right next to the car. Its actually louder inside the mosque than it was when he was right next to his car. Bear in mind there is sound absorbing carpet, multiple walls for the sound to travel through, and I would guess the car is 25 feet away at this point.

              It was streamed as well. The loss of sound or presence of it is unpredictable to say the least. People are acting as if there isn’t such a thing as data loss on live stream from a cell phone or whatever he was using.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is and you can’t predict it.

               </p>
               <p>
                I am pretty sure with as many times that the video has been copied and reuploaded it has lost many of the finer details too.
               </p>
               <p>
                Think about how many times it was put on YouTube .....fuck reddit even said it blocked 1.6 million requests so the video is damn near nowhere close to orginal sync by the time you or I saw it.

                 True, but I was on 8ch when this was dropped and I have one of the best copies for sure. I can see dropped shells on the ground for example (other people are claiming the shell casings dissapear in thin air, but I can actually see them hit the ground so I know that is a bullshit consipiracy).
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can also see the audio syncs very well through the whole thing for me during the gunfire. I don't think this changes anything obviously, I'm on the "acceration train" at this point. So its already a moot point.

                  Acceleration train?

                  I don’t know what that means.

                  Rather than looking for flaws with this video people should be wondering where the money came from for these guns. Fucking AR base price is over 2k there and the media claims his were illegal modified......
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He had 30 rnd mags instead of 7 like he was supposed to.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also he had couplers on them and the media is trying to say they were 60rnd hi-caps
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Lots of shit being changed or whatever with the narrative and I think in the coming times the reason for them to ban the video will be much more obvious because they are slowly changing the story.

                   I guess you're not familiar with the idea of acceleration. The idea that the time for voting and trying to change things through activism or other non-violent means are past. We've past the tipping point. The idea of acclerating to cause chaos and force people to take action, rather than being like the frog that is slowly boiled, is the basic idea. I'm saying that this event accerates things whether we like it or not, we are all on the "acceleration train" now. I'm not sure we're ready for it yet, I think this event is premature, but obiously now there will be pushes for shutting down the chans, more gun control laws, etc. So people need to prepare accordingly.

            I just can't shake the feeling that were being decieved on a global scale. That a great big trick is being played on every decent soul on earth and when the trap springs, everyone will let out a collective "ohhhhhh, were fucked". And then the REALLY bad shit will start.

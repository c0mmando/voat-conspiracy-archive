            I'm glad I'm not the only person who has noticed this.  I do believe the gov't and 'responding agencies' have developed a playbook to counter on-the ground 'freelance' coverage and have been slowly perfecting it with each act of 'domestic unrest'  From the OWS protest through to Baltimore.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed with the Boston lockdown, there was a lot of avenues of information available to digest- multiple night-long video streams, twitters, 2 different police radio streams, and countless forums.  When Ferguson came around, there was a LOT less immediate reporting available, but still enough to where you could get an honest feel for what was going on during the protests and later the riots.  With Baltimore, there was virtually none of that.  I had managed to find 1 'stream' of the protests, which was only 3hrs and had been pre-recorded.  I managed to find 4 'streams' for the riots, but they too were all pre-recorded and none more than a few hours long.  With each event, it's as if little-by-little, TPTB fine-tune their information-gathering apparatus to prevent and circumvent 'undesirable' information getting out, to the point of brute-forcing.  Remember that guy streaming from Ferguson who had his phone 'stolen' while streaming?  Maybe that wasn't such a 'random act of looting' as it was 'intentional information control'.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I find incredibly peculiar about the whole Baltimore kerfuffle: A large amount of high-school kids are corralled into one location, against their will, and prevented from going home by riot-ready police.  I was always told they were this techno-crazy market that can't stop taking pictures of every binality around them.  So why is there not a flood of pictures from this group of kids?  Were they somehow prevented from
            <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-patent-could-remotely-disable-protesters-phone-cameras/">
             utilizing their phones cameras
            </a>
            ?  Not to say that specific technology was utilized, but perhaps something else was.  As I said, I'm just dumbfounded by the lack of photos from this incident.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole thing, the protests and the riots, reek of on-the-ground manipulation and control of information.

             I think that was part of the test, get the national guard involved, and see how much information they can suppress. The CNN guy made a few comments about "there are so many people here we can't get a signal out", while degrading their video to make it look real. Actually acting like they don't have a fat sat transmitter on top of the cnn van...

            Nah, McReddit was blocked from work and I hardly go there from home (or mobile) because of the blatantly obvious forced perspective. I'll just cut out the Pao-middleman, stop giving them my  pageviews and ad revenue (even though I was using AdBlock) and go straight to CNN or FOX if I want McReddit level information.

            The internet is getting smaller...They killed Grooveshark. I know it's minor compared to Baltimore, but the general idea is that the frame of mankind's mind is being put through the addle with all the avenues of data processing being constrained to certain narratives.

             I think more censored and staged than getting smaller, but yes definitely constrained.
            </p>
            <p>
             Twitter was really good at uncensored reactions of real people, and live info getting out, for awhile. Reddit used to be the same, lots of info was being leaked out to the masses. Then reddit goes to hell because of mods and shills, and stuff like this gets implemented

            you may be right, but I find an increasing number of people either don't give a shit, or don't think they can make a change.

            You are right, if the resolution does not make sense (like the he tried to break his own neck story...) people should and will get pissed off. But if regular people cannot see the action, they are less likely to react. (break out the pitchforks)

            I just noticed a serious lack of real citizens reporting on twitter, vine, livestream, and even youtube compared to last time. I was posting to see if people noticed any active censorship or network problems that would explain it.

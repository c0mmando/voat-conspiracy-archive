            From what I see here in the UK, people are thrashing around trying to make sense of what is happening to them. A lot of the young are mistakenly moving to the left, reacting to our Conservative government and it's austerity policies and the systems of control that bind them.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's just one more step to figure out that it's the system, not one political party that's at fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            I allowed myself a spark of hope with the Occupy movement that an awakening was happening, but it wasn't to be. Soon though, I believe that.

            From what I understand, there are many factions on both sides - good and evil. We know for the most part that the evil factions are controlled by monetary institutions; banksters and the old world families that started them. On the other side are many other groups that can be called the good guys. People like 'white hats' and other pro-liberty forces are active in the game.

           <p>
            There does not appear to be much on the individual level sans learning a trade, how to be less dependent on the system and more independent/self-sustainable. Grow a garden, share with your neighbors, and change the "see something say something trust no one" mentality this subversive government has forced upon its citizens.

             Building independent alternatives to the systems we rely on to survive is key.  Maybe the only way.  If you're food, water, and energy independent, who can claim control over you?

            One way is to not depend on their products that make them money.  Cut them off.  Buy a piece of land  and make it a sustainable farm.  Make your own food (as much as you can).  Use solar power off the power grid.  Use 'well water' and not the city's water.  Have a your own septic tank for waste.  Build a greenhouse.  Learn horticulture.  Learn aquaponics and hydroponics.  You can raise goats, sheep, pigs, chickens and take them to a butcher if you don't want to do it yourself.  Learn to fish and hunt.  If everyone went back to these simple ways of living they wouldn't have the control over us they have.  Obviously we can't make other people choose to cut themselves off from the system in place but we can if we choose to.  Do all this and you can make your own business selling the food you make at farmers markets, restaurants, and local stores.  It might not stop them but it stops your interaction with them and you'll feel better that you aren't supporting them as much.   Also trade with your neighbors.  Trade, trade, trade!

            The human species is at the whim of the DNA chain that spawned it. As such, evolution has forced us to develop an ego and believe in the sanctity of the separation of self and other in order to promote survival of a body. For anything to make sense we need some type of objective reality for it all to take place in. Problem is objective reality doesn't exist. Everything is one. Our mind is persistently cut off from the world in a darkened skull (Plato's cave) so it must create a reality from sensual input and memories. This created narrative then becomes confused for objective reality and we wonder why the world is so fucked up. Blue sky? WTF!?!
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is: this is the natural state of events, this must be the path of least resistance. The separation between self and other can now be seen as a necessary illusion imposed on us, by genetic lottery, to promote survival of the body until reproductive age. The consequence of this is generations later we're left confusing our lives for reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once as a species we can collectively become aware that objective reality is a tool created by DNA to promote survival, and we are all in fact infinite fractal timeless expressions of the vibrating multiverse;, concepts like birth and death and identity will melt away and new human experiences will develop.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am confident this is happening as my ego is kept in check by the fact that I no longer confuse my experience for objective reality, it still feels and appears objective, but I know it isn't.

            We can strive to be informed, questioning everything, and sharing those ideas with others.  We can become involved locally, nationally, or globally.  We can fact check ideas, and pose civil discourse. We can challenge current paradigms, even (if not especially) those we believe in.  Should anything super severe happen in our lifetimes (financial collapse, global martial law, use of nuclear weapons or worse) we should be prepared to lead rational discourse as to proposed solutions.  Should nothing ever change from the way it is today, we should continue to hold those in control to a rigid standard.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, posing questions like this is one of the best things that we can do.  Many people shy away from these topics because they are afraid that if they are true they wouldn't know what to do or how to handle it, most falling into the mindset that there's nothing they can even do.  Posing these questions can disarm the fear that goes with the ideas and turn it into a power to lead change instead of a fear of how others will.

            Our present political/economic system is based on growth - growth of industries that they can profit from. Take that away from them and they are nothing. So what can we do? Stop consuming their shit as much as possible. As well, produce/create alternative forms of news/media/entertainment so that you can reduce their influence.

            Oh ya, be careful with the following in you live if the "free world", but make sure that you know enough information so that you can win any debate with anyone that defends this system, i.e., know your shit and put people who defend this vial

            All we can do is to keep sharing information to shine the light on those who are spreading misinformation. We have the internet and sites like this now where it is easy to do; much easier than the people investigating JFK back in the day.

              Zombies are pretty ineffectual actors compared to informed and well equipped citizens with earnest intent to make change.  The most devastating effect they could have to a working society would be to dishearten others.  Theres more for transparency and change than you'll recognize without searching, we're just more disconnected than the zombie hordes. For now.

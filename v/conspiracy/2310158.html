            And here is what i wrote, if you feel like reposting it:
           </p>
           <p>
            =====
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you! Replying briefly just now; will reply more later; a couple of things. I knew very little about any of this meteor, atmospheric, electrical, fire science stuff until mid-October. When I saw these anomalies I had an open mind about the possibility of DEWs or other interventions being in play, but I kinda remembered something about Wisconsin having these spooky fires, with something about a comet. I refreshed my memory. I noticed with astonishment that those fires also started, in a widespread area, on the evening of Oct 8.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1883, a guy called Ignatius Donnelly wrote a book called Ragnarok, in which (near the end) he proposes that the 1871 fires were started by hot meteorites. In his theory, fragments from "lost" Comet Biela (believed to have broken up in 1852) crashed into that region and started the fires. It was a good thought but it was wrong. Some folks piped up again about this in 2004 or so. Scientists dismissed the idea because the Biela fragments were somewhere else. Also, increasingly, they enforced the (false) dogma that meteorites are always cold (more on this soon).
           </p>
           <p>
            Comet GZ and the Draconid meteors had not yet been discovered when Donnelly wrote his book.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought the coincidence of strange fire start times might still be related to meteors, comets, asteroids, something. The Biela fragments were not in play. I glanced at the annual calendar for meteor showers &amp; found that the Draconids peak at exactly that time. I now believe it could have been any day, but perhaps more likely at such a "peak."
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm a retired health researcher and have access to the considerable resources of my university's library. I began a crash course in meteor and other sciences in my effort to figure this out. I read dozens of papers, looked at all kinds of old books, government reports etc.  I also subscribe to newspapers.com and can see not only the news coverage of the 1871 stuff but also of most meteor-related events of the past 200 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            It became clear to me that meteorites can be ice cold, burning hot or anything in between. Scientists knew this in the old days. In the 1930s, it looks like a disinfo program began. Several professors wrote articles for the general public to say they're always cold. This became the party line, though reports still stray from it. The "official" story is that they're most likely always cold, but "we don't have much evidence." That's BS. We got plenty.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, in order for fires to start simultaneously across a wide area, it would need to be a "bolide" overhead explosion, as we saw at Chelyabinsk (2013) &amp; Tunguska (1908). Chelyabinsk likely didn't start fires because of heavy snow cover. There was no such explosion &amp; shock wave in 2017, and the noise + tornado winds of 1871 seemed different.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I explored the electrical possibilities. As I say, this is not my field; I'm really a novice; but I know how to research.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's actually another electrical angle. Many have noted that sometimes you can hear noise from overhead fireballs, concurrent with them. How can this be if they're many miles above? A couple of recent hypotheses. One is that the sound is actually transmitted to us through the meteor's light; conducted on Earth in metal, or even organic substance like leaves; they vibrate &amp; we hear sound. But could this ever generate heat?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not as keen on that one, though. It doesn't allow much for strangeness of fire. And really, my main idea doesn't say much, I know, except that it's weird because space is weird. Consider, however, that such fire might be infused (in some way that we don't yet understand) with the cosmic rays brought in by the meteor; and that all that enornous electromagnetic interaction among the Sun, planets, comets &amp; our atmosphere may supercharge this fire. When weather &amp; environmental conditions are just right, any "shooting star" could set off such a fire. I didn't get into it, but atmospheric winds were exactly right in 2017 (jet stream overhead) and 1871 (cold front about to pounce).
           </p>
           <p>
            And back to the hot meteorites: If indeed they can be hot: Consider that in weird fires (or even normal fires) that start up in a more limited area (as we saw in LA), it doesn't need to be a bolide explosion. It could be a single red hot meteorite, even a tiny one, zooming in to a dry spot.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this happens a LOT. I noticed that sometimes when old newspapers wrote about wonderful meteor showers, there were reports on the same page about forest fires. Often, the fires were "believed to be the work of incendiaries." That would be bizarre, arsonists roaming the mid-20th century West, starting fires. Gonna make something on that topic soon.
           </p>
           <p>
            But here's another take-away message, or a few:
           </p>
           <p>
            Meteors &amp; impacts WAY more than most people realize
           </p>
           <p>
            Events like Chelyabinsk seemed more frequent before the '50s
           </p>
           <p>
            Active US &amp; Soviet collaboration throughout the "cold war" -- which was possibly staged. Nuke testing simulates asteroid impact effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Continued active global collabs around near-Earth objects, of which there are many; have they reduced noticeably large bolide events? Possibly so? Chelyabinsk surprised then because it came thru at a very low angle? 19th &amp; early 20th century had a bunch that seemed like Chelyabinsk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Public learns of meteor showers as entertainment events; not much info seems "concealed"; there's tons of it available; but it really seems subject to a lot of "spin." In short, the masses would be scared if they understood about meteors, fires, possibility of getting smashed etc. But really, we've always had this risk. No reason to be freaked out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I felt that the DEW promoters seem to intentionally promote fear. Alertness &amp; action may be good, but their fear-promotion got me thinking that they're disinfo agents or just trying to make some YouTube money.
           </p>
           <p>
            One last thought, i have no evidence at all for this: Possibly, chemtrails, HAARP and other geoengineering stuff have some bearing on anti-meteor efforts. Especially since there are easily detectable electromagnetic relationships among the Sun and solar weather, comets, meteors, and, importantly, the Aurora Borealis (and Aurora Australis). It's possible that there is misdirection going on about this stuff too. Who benefits when the people are riled up &amp; in fear; or are divided as "conspiracists vs. scientists," when both are saying the wrong thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I figure most involved scientists have some ideas about the real situation, and either keep their mouths shut or help to spin.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like that in soms areas of biomedical research too.

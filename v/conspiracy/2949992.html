           The book industry has become like Hollywood. Modern editors have become producers, who ask writers to write books based on somebody else's ideas. As you might understand, you can't write a good book if you are payed to write it, because it's simply not your own idea, therefore you can't formulate it correctly. The three examples are The Hunger Games, Divergent and The 5th Wave. The Hunger Games was not really bad, because the hired writer was at least able to create a decent plot without logic fallacies. The two other books are really awful, written by two idiots. Divergent is missing the faction of artists for example, imagine how demented the writer must be to forget about artists. The 5th Wave writer not only was unable to create normal characters, but also has no idea what the 5th wave is. Now that the book industry has become like Hollywood, where producers tell writers to write not their own stories, obviously we won't be able to have good books written by people who want to tell their own stories.

            I don't know about fiction, but non-fiction is shallow and old news ish. It's always like they're holding back for their follow on book. Not to mention its propaganda like everything else. And they tell us we should read books! Pshaw!

            The major publishing houses have been controlled by Jews for many decades. Just as they use their control over Hollywood to pump communist, globalist, "progressive" propaganda into the minds of viewers, they use their control over the publishing industry to pump the same propaganda into the minds of readers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Writers cannot write freely and honestly any longer -- they are censored by editors and publishers, and what is worse, they are forced to self-censor in order to have their manuscripts even considered for publication. Editors won't let text pass with anything in it that even hints at being politically incorrect. Many great writers blocked by the major publishing houses are forced to publish with small publishers or self-publish, and as a consequence, you don't even know they exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all about money for the big houses, who hire writers who can churn out the same vomit that the dogs have licked in the past. The last thing they want is truth. Truth to Jew publishers is like holy water to vampires.

            The only new books I read are from Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Most new books are terrible, with all this cheating wives/husbands and some surprise rape thrown in there for some reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Old books do a fine job of telling stories without some random rape bullshit thrown in. I feel like the authors do it on purpose, maybe they'll think more people will read it? I don't know, but it ought to say on the back if it's a rapey book. I don't sign up to read about rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good thing about books, though, is you can delve into the classics. Right now I am enjoying Isaac Asimov. It's a shame there's not a lot of good new books right now, but libraries still rock with older books.

             I used to read Preston and Child for entertainment, but lately I've lost interest. I can't stomach any more Pendergast novels. I'm finding it very hard to find fiction that can hold my interest. An exception is Cormac McCarthy, who is a great writer -- our greatest living writer in my opinion. As for the crap that is being churned out by the truckload, I can't even begin to read it.

              Yeah I also got sick of pendergast. I like the gideon crew novels but then I'm not too sure how new they are. I'll be sure to check out Cormac McCarthy, thanks for the tip.

            I think the book industry will be even easier to take into our own hands. Book creation and distribution is even easier than music, and professional music recording has been made much more accessible.

            On one side you got the Yid mafia who own and control everything, and who want everyone else to become passive retards.  On the other side you have passive retards.

            I've found that the book industry is saturated by mediocrity. Books now are watered down and lack depth. They feel like "young adult" novels but marketed to adults. We are stuck having to go back to the previous generation for anything stimulating, which is unfortunate because the world is moving at an exponentially increasing pace, and it would be nice if some actual writers gave us something current.

             It’d like this so as not to offend any of the readers, ie the current state of any form of entertainment of science journals for that matter is the equivalent of expecting to see Eddie Murphy do a comedy routine and that it’s gonna be hilarious if he can’t make fun of us or use the F or N word.

             Same difference. Everything is being watered down and repetitive (think Miley Cyrus or Rihanna songs) to keep us from thinking and so as to usher in the NWO.

             I think you're being a little harsh on modern authors. Yes, it's hard to find a good one and we've lost Terry Pratchett and Tom Clancy. But  Neil Gaiman, Steven Baxter and Iain M Banks are still out there. If you want true greatness then yes, you'll have to look to the past because it doesn't come around everyday. Expecting everyone to match Robert Heinlein or Isaac Asimov's imagination is ridiculous, there is a reason they are famous.

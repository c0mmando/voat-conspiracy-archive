  'formattedContent' => '<p>Have you ever noticed how you\'re allowed to have opinions about anything, as long as it\'s not something important? You can argue about which Lord of the Rings movie is the best, or what sports team should win and why, and everyone plays along and has fun.  But the second you start to talk about anything of actual real importance, people suddenly clam up and shy away. Why?</p>
<p>Because we\'ve been conditioned that we need to have a certain emotional tone at all times when conversing with other humans. Notice how it is <em>never</em> okay in our society for you to be openly angry about something? Even if you are 100% correct and <em>should</em> be angry? Calmness is seen as paired with rationality, which ignores that passion can be rational sometimes. In our society, passion is discouraged unless you are profiting someone else. So you are allowed to have passion for your consumerism and for your job. But never for how bad the Fed is, or how we should end all these illegal wars the US keeps starting for profit. You mention those, and 95% of people will instantly be looking to change the subject out of discomfort. If you are overly passionate about these things, it pushes people away very fast. So the only good approach is to be &quot;light&quot; about it, and just mention it in passing or as part of a joke and then move on. </p>
<p>You must always pretend to be calm, even if you are not and have no reason to be, or else you are seen as a &quot;looney&quot; who is &quot;off his rocker&quot; and &quot;needs to calm down&quot; and &quot;could be a threat&quot; so on and so forth. People love to think they\'re better and more logical than someone who is being emotional, especially if American government/corporate propaganda backs them up on their talking points.</p>
<p>So to maintain this required facade of non-anger, people avoid reading and conversing about topics that make them angry, so they better fit in to society. Work gives them enough stress. They want to have friends and succeed in this human world and so on, so they play by society\'s rules. So they slowly close their mind off to anything controversial to their in-group. They deaden themselves to the ugly realities of the world, day after day. They see everyone around them doing it too, they see the consequences play out for people who got angry for a bit and said something they &quot;shouldn\'t have&quot;. They decide it\'s the right choice, that being dead inside is what you\'re &quot;supposed to do&quot; and don\'t even consider alternatives, especially because those alternatives are very uncomfortable. Once you get to about 30 or 40, you\'re basically locked in to this mindset forever unless a big life event happens to change your mind.</p>
<p>This is why so many Americans are just quiet about all the terrible terrible shit that is happening. They are just keeping their heads down, trying to succeed. Not only financially, but socially too, which demands this calmness, which demands generally avoiding angry topics and not thinking too deeply about them (or else you might get worked up, someone might see/hear you, and that might hurt your social standing or your income).</p>
<p>On top of it all, the genuinely important topics are so over-laden with emotion by the media to make conversing about them very difficult. For example, the Zionist ownership of the US government is pretty important. But even the word &quot;zionist&quot; is so emotionally charged, people guffaw at the mere mention of the word even though they don\'t know what it means. These conspiracy forums are filled with hyperbolic garbage like flat earth and cern wormhole portals which they pay to upvote to the top, to discredit the sub and make everyone here look insane. That way people are afraid to come back here after seeing how it looks, and their minds remain closed.</p>
<p>The discourse about truly important topics is so polarized (intentionally or not) that it\'s nearly impossible to talk to your fellow human beings about it in a regular conversation. It only comes out at 3am after a lot of drinks, because we are all terrified of looking bad in each other\'s eyes, even though we mostly agree with each other! We\'re scared that everyone is like the media tells us they are, dangerous and judgmental, so we each silently bear this burden of truth in our own minds. Few have the courage to overcome this fear and speak out in real life (or even online) and even fewer can do it in a way that conforms to the social norms of &quot;calmness&quot;. George Carlin did it with <em>humor</em>, and that\'s why he is worshiped. The emotional packaging of ideas means a lot in our society, maybe more than the ideas themselves. Having our priories so backwards, placing our emotions first and the truth of reality second, is what is leading to the downfall of our nation. People are literally out of touch with reality, and no one ever &quot;touches&quot; them to bring them back in because generally speaking we\'re all so scared and offended of each other that we can\'t connect in a real emotional way anymore. We\'re each in our own bubbles of denial. So we create our own little echo chambers and cross our fingers that things will work out, which was basically the American mantra starting in the 1970s once our political process started being taken over by corporations. That &quot;eyes wide shut&quot; mentality worked for a few decades, but time is running out for being in denial. </p>
<p>Divide and conquer, expressed at it\'s fullest. Emotions are much easier to manipulate than ideas and thoughts. Companies figured this out in the 50s and 60s and advertisements became about manipulating emotions instead of giving you facts about the product. We as Americans need to increase our IQ, but more importantly we need to increase our EQ and stop falling for the constant emotional manipulation coming from the media. And not only do we need to do it, we need to help others do it. It\'s time we awaken to our control structures, as a society, and be openly conversational about what is happening instead of hiding in the shadows because we\'re afraid. Only by learning how the control structures work can we learn to overcome them. And only by overcoming the programmed fear can we begin conversations about these things. This attitude needs to become part of our culture before we can really fix anything else. It\'s the foundation upon which everything else rests. I can\'t imagine anything more important than this.</p>
<p>My worry is that everyone has their head so far in the sand that the only thing that will change the path we\'re on is a catastrophe that suddenly brings reality in to the limelight. If people <em>really</em> tried spreading the word as much as possible we might be able to wake up before the next catastrophe, but seeing as reality got hung to cheers at the end of the last South Park episode and how accurate that feels, I don\'t know how much hope I really have. </p>
<p>Remember, just being honest with one person about one thing can start a wildfire effect that could end up waking up tons of people. Why not try? You scared?</p>',

            Everyone prioritize emotions over reality, not only non-Americans but also non-nowadays people. There's a reason if Christianity and Islam are extremely more popular than Rationalism or Stoicism. I mean, even many scientists make irrational claims all the time...

            What America is good at is
            <em>
             manipulating
            </em>
            this natural human tendency. Anyway propaganda is just doing the same thing religion used to do in the past, more efficiently, more quickly, but it's still the same old, sad game. A game that works every time, because it taps on fundamental human flaws.

            You can't wake up people. They don't want to wake up, because dreams are better than a grim reality check. All you can do is either wait for the situation to go so bad that people go berserk, which usually ends up in a massacre and a new bullshit tyranny in place of the old one, or just stop giving a damn about
            <em>
             everyone
            </em>
            and only associate with people like you in order to do something
            <em>
             for you
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Thinking big is good and all, but let's not be the people we're criticizing here: let's be rational and aim to something we can actually achieve in a lifetime.

            From an outside perspective American institutions seem to make impulse short term choices rather than thinking about the bigger picture and planning for it for the betterment of society as a whole That's one thing that my country is good at anyways.

            I agree with a lot of what you said. I think it is a combination of people being saturated in meaningless experiences via corporate and mindless media, in addition to people who do recognize bad shit that is happening not knowing the exact course to solve the unbelievably complex web of problems we as a species face at the moment. By lacking an alternative model of existence, we are faced with either being co-opted into the systems of present or violent revolution. Most people are not looking to die, or have their family, friends or acquaintances harmed or targeted either.

            One piece of information I am always looking to plug to ANYONE whenever I am in a related conversation is the documentary: "The Century of the Self" by Adam Curtis. It is a very wide-ranging exploration of a lot of different power structures in play in the United States. One theme that runs throughout is how psychological techniques developed by a modern pioneer of propaganda, Edward Bernays, influenced American business and government to manipulate the public. Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent" is another related book that is a wealth of verifiable truths.

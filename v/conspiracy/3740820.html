            Pretty sure I read the original strain of SARS-CoV that it was dveloped from came from Fort Detrick, Maryland.  It was then spliced with a spike-protein insertion which itself was a chimera of 2 other viruses, based on HIV.

            You fell for Chinese propaganda, it was definitely China who released the virus knowingly on the world they hid the outbreak for months, executed doctors. Let all their Chinese nationals return to Western countries after visting China during New Years.
           </p>
           <p>
            You forget China has a effective spy ring in the USA and a large propaganda wing, Chinese state agents physically stole millions of medical records on Americans a few years ago. Hmmmm... why would China want medical records other then to design a more effective bio-weapon against Americans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then theres historical fact that China has been responsible for 90% of the past plagues and diseases released on the world along with the recent ones. Occams razor.

             The bitch was being PAID by the US and Chinese governments to work at Fort Detrick, where she got the SARS-CoV sample.  There's a timeline image going back before that, through the construction of the Wuhan lab, up through the release.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, we also know it was around since AT LEAST November, as reported by several countries who had mysterious pneumonia-like illnesses.  What else happened then?  A strange "flu" outbreak on one side of Ft. Detrick, and on the other side was an absolutely unheard of "vaping illness" with the same symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, what happened just before that?  Fort Detrick was warned about safety risks.  What happened after?  They got SHUT THE FUCK DOWN.  Huh.   All just coincidence, right?

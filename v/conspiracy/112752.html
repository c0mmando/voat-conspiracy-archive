            Why is "Accidentally" in quotes?  You title suggests that it was something more nefarious.. like the officer was murdered or something.  This seemed to truly be an accident due to lack of tactical training, which was exactly what the slain officer had been petitioning for.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a side note in regards to the article:  It said the officers "encountered" each other in a back room while searching a 723-square-foot apartment.. with a circular floorplan??   723 sqft is not a large area.. how circular could it possibly be (a circle with a 15 foot radius is ~700sqft)?
           </p>
           <p>
            And 2ndly.. why are transit police searching peoples homes??
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I found the apartment floor plan online.  I guess I could see how 2 officers could take two separate paths and then converge.

                Well as the article states and the quote from his wife (who is also an officer in the transit dept) “As a result of these repeated denials, my husband said to me, ‘If anything happens to me, I want you to sue the s— out of BART and Fairow.’ ” Kellie Smith wrote in her letter. “My husband’s words will stay with me forever. I cannot let this situation and his concern for his fellow officers go unanswered.”
               </p>
               <p>
                This didn't appear to be a concern from an internal threat (like someone on the force is out to get him), but rather a general concern that due to repeated dangerous situations, the force as a whole, including himself, was ill prepared and untrained for "tactical situations".  His numerous requests for SWAT in specific circumstances where he felt their training would be most beneficial for the situation at hand was denied repeatedly.  His request for additional training was also denied... so this seems more like someone out of frustration saying to their wife "If I'm killed sue the department and specifically my boss"... meaning he felt that due the the departments lack of training he was concerned it was going to get him killed - by a bad guy or someone else.. either way he recognized mistakes are being made and ultimately its going to cause a needless death.
               </p>
               <p>
                As far as just downvoating for the hell of it.. really?  I thought we were trying to create something new here

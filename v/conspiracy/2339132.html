            Trail Blazer won over thin-thread only because of contract profit potential not national security.  Thinthread is NSA checkmate on terrorism.  Only caveman level terrorism with Thinthread.

            William Binney could have prevented 9/11 but they did away with him.  Trump brought him back.  So much winning.

            It will be fun to cross check the sealed indictment list with this one. Bet big stones it's a lot of correlation.

            I believe Pres. TRump will expose the 911 conspiracy, but that he is waiting for the evil GHWB to go to Hell first. Because our President is a merciful man.

             I think he'll expose the truth if there's profit in it for him or the USA. He is after all a  businessman.

              That could be. Either way, exposing this will wake up whomever is left that wants to wake up.

            I think it was not only thermite but also directed energy weapons. Dr Judy Wood has lots of information on this. How else do you explain the toasted/melted cars several blocks maybe even a mile away from the towers

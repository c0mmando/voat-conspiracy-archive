            I'm pretty troubled about Trump's 'law and order' rhetoric.  It sounds like a heavy handed police state is on it's way, and people won't even be able to say he didn't warn us.

             You're getting a sugar coated police state or an outright police state. No matter who you "elect" at the end of the day. I say "elect", because we all know you're not electing anyone. You're given a choice between Trump and Hillary... what kind of election is that?

            The real reason IMO they are blaming Russia is because of the news report Russian state media dropped...

            Putin is probably getting even for the Panama paper incident where he was implicated and blamed USA propaganda.

            You can see how these True Or False sites really are bought when it comes to politics. Snopes and the site below basically say it's false because it's "Russian propaganda". Really makes you see why they are pushing the Russian propaganda angle so hard on MSM. NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS!

            "The sad story of Seth Conrad’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them.
           </p>
           <p>
            A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights

            I suspect there are still people in the 3 letter agencies that take protecting their nation's people from its enemies seriously and the DNC has shown itself to be one of those enemies. What happened to Snowdon showed that using the " proper channels" doesn't work. Setting things free on the net is super effective.

            The DNC is full of old people who don't understand how email, technology, and the internet. Hubris and decades of success made them sloppy. Incompetence isn't a conspiracy. Old people suck at computers and the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most likely scenario is that the server was never patched. That means anyone who wanted access had it.

             That is also a very feasible explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Occam's Razor would say that this is also the most likely answer.

            <p>
             I also suspect that the DNC does not have as many technical people that they used to. This new generation of technical people seems to swing classical liberal, alt right, and libertarian. People that the DNC alienates.

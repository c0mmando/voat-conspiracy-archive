            The authors of the Bill of Rights and Constitution believed to the core that government and trust are not synonymous. You, as a citizen of a country run by a government, should NEVER trust the government. Being armed is the last defense, however marginalized the choice of weapon may be, against a tyrannical government and those that support it. 
But I agree with your post and have been saying this for a while now: once US.GOV realizes we're losing or have lost the ME, they will turn inward and start taking what they can in a final grasp for control of something -- anything... Those against them at this juncture will be Public Enemy #1 .
           </p>
           <p>
            People forget that we have ~6 million veterans that would still fight and die for this country - not the idiot leaders. We have about the same in active duty that would do the same. There are millions of people armed and waiting for something to happen because it appears to be always right around the corner. It's a shame violence must be met with violence, but there seems to be no other way. I really don't know, I am just going by what I hear and read and making an assumption...

            Either way, it's going to be fast, bright, and non-televised.

That frightens me." This is how Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown professor and former Pentagon official under President Obama, explained the US policy on drone strikes during a congressional hearing last year.﻿

            Yeah, the war on walmart shoppers is a dead end. Obama fucked up with trying to push that one over on the people. It was a serious political and ideological blunder. I used to work for Brent Scowcroft back in the day. That guy was a political genius and got shit done. This new batch of politifags are nitwits. Its been like watching amateur hour for six years straight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Luckily, not everyone in the administration is as dumb as the War on Walmart Shoppers dipshits. Right now they're preparing a local war against Narco Mexican lefty terrorists. The police unions have been hurt bad by the sweep of marijuana softening. They are desperate to hold onto their tanks. For-profit prisons are getting crunched too. Hell, there's a ready made army of latin gang members with tight military-like formations already in our prison system. I wouldn't be suprised if the opening attack was a mass arming and breakout of a big penitentiary with all the latinos getting AKs, RPGs, and sweeping out through central California. That is why the most likely next enemy will be Mexican drug gangs that have "infiltrated" the US. Democrats can act like they care about average and poor immigrants. Republicans can act tough on crime and the big defenders of the home front. And the Military Industrial Complex (MIC) can continue making bank selling police and National Guard troops (an historically under-served market for the MIC. National Guard Armories are desperate to have logistics thrown their way to the tune of several hundred billion dollars). Nothing like modernizing the National Gaurd with posh new weapon systems to make a quick buck. Put your bets on local narco terrorists as the next big thing. You heard it here first.

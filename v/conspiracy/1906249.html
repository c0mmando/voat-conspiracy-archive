            For CTR it is an easy analogy. Whenever engaging in a CTR account you can simply think of them as an Indian Telemarketer. I have consistently been able to shut them down with escalation, find a sore point (Hillary got caught selling Stinger Missiles to the Al Nusra Front) with citations. They will stop, per their script. Distract them. Even as completely wasted as I am I cannot comment much further but think in terms of profit motive. If a shill is doxxed, the $15/USD immediately becomes a pittance in light of what their family or community might think. Noncoms are similar. Remind them of their oaths. Distract them from their boring task list enough to wake them up. I have caused several to resign their posts.

            And if you'd wanted to save it, you'd exile them from your lands. Geonocide is questionable. Exile of all blacks is necessary for the US to survive. I would gladly pay extra taxes for a year, 2 years, 4 years for the process of niggers to be banished from this nation to "Wakanda" to be fulfilled. Unfortunately the centuries of Jewish influence has too deeply embedded them within our nation. It will fall and it will be disatrous.

            That piece came out of a speech by a former Governor of Colorado, Dick Lamm.  Here is the whole thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            On The Lamm (former Governor of Colorado)
           </p>
           <pre><code>Wherever you stand, please take the time to read this; it ought to scare the pants off you!

We know Dick Lamm as the former Governor of Colorado. In that context his thoughts are particularly poignant. Last week there was an immigration overpopulation conference in Washington, DC, filled to capacity by many of America's finest minds and leaders. A brilliant college professor by the name of Victor Hansen Davis talked about his latest book, "Mexifornia," explaining how immigration - both legal and illegal was destroying the entire state of California. He said it would march across the country until it destroyed all vestiges of ‘The American Dream’.

Moments later, former Colorado Governor Richard D. Lamm stood up and gave a stunning speech on how to destroy America. The audience sat spellbound as he described eight methods for the destruction of the
</code></pre>
           <p>
            United States. He said, "If you believe that America is too smug, too self-satisfied, too rich, then let's destroy America. It is not that hard to do. No nation in history has survived the ravages of time.  Arnold Toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall and that 'An autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide.'"
           </p>
           <pre><code>"Here is how they do it," Lamm said: "First, to destroy America, turn America into a bilingual or multi-lingual and bicultural country." History shows that no nation can survive the tension, conflict, and antagonism of two or more competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; however, it is a curse for a society to be bilingual. The historical scholar, Seymour Lipset, put it this way: "The histories of bilingual and bi-cultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy." Canada, Belgium, Malaysia, and Lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed an ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons, and Corsicans."

Lamm went on:  Second, to destroy America," Invent
</code></pre>
           <p>
            'multiculturalism' and encourage immigrants to maintain their culture. Make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal that there are no cultural differences. Make it an article of faith that the Black and Hispanic dropout rates are due solely to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out of bounds”.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Third, "We could make the United States a 'Hispanic Quebec' without much effort. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently: "The apparent success of our own multiethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentricity and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together." Lamm said, "I would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor. It is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in America enforcing their differences rather than as Americans, emphasizing their similarities."

"Fourth, I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated. I would add a second underclass, unassimilated,
</code></pre>
           <p>
            under-educated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% dropout rate from high school."
           </p>
           <pre><code>"My fifth point for destroying America would be to get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of 'Victimology.' I would get all minorities to think that their lack of success was the fault of the majority. I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority population."

"My sixth plan for America's downfall would include dual citizenship, and promote divided loyalties. I would celebrate diversity over unity.  I would stress differences rather than similarities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other - that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent. People undervalue the unity it takes to keep a nation together. Look at the ancient Greeks. The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common Language and literature; and they worshipped the same gods. All Greece took part in the Olympic games. A common enemy, Persia, threatened their liberty. Yet all these bonds were not strong enough to overcome two factors: local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions. Greece fell. "E.Pluribus Unum"--From many, one. In that historical reality, if we put the emphasis on the 'pluribus' instead of the 'Unum,' we will balkanize America as surely as Kosovo."

"Next to last, I would place all subjects off limits; make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of 'diversity.'  I would find a word similar to 'heretic' in the 16th century - that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like 'racist' or 'xenophobe' halt discussion and debate. Having made America a bilingual/bicultural country, having established multi-culturism, having the large foundations fund the doctrine of 'Victimology,' I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra: That because immigration has been good for America, it must always be good. I would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them."

In the last minute of his speech, Governor Lamm wiped his brow. Profound silence followed. Finally he said, "Lastly, I would censor Victor Hanson Davis's  book "Mexifornia." His book is dangerous. It exposes the plan to destroy America. If you feel America deserves to be destroyed, don't read that book."

There was no applause. A chilling fear quietly rose like an ominous cloud above every attendee at the conference. Every American in that room knew that everything Lamm enumerated was proceeding
</code></pre>
           <p>
            methodically, quietly, darkly, yet pervasively across the United States today. Discussion is being suppressed. Over 100 languages are ripping the foundation of our educational system and national cohesiveness. Even barbaric cultures that practice female genital mutilation are growing as we celebrate 'diversity.' American jobs are vanishing into the Third World as corporations create a Third World in America - take note of California and other states to date, ten million illegal aliens and growing fast. It is reminiscent of George Orwell's book "1984."  In that story, three slogans are engraved in the Ministry of Truth building: 
"War is peace," 
"Freedom is slavery," and 
"Ignorance is strength."
           </p>
           <pre><code>Governor Lamm walked back to his seat. It dawned on everyone at the conference that our nation and the future of this great democracy is deeply in trouble and worsening fast. If we don't get this immigration monster stopped within three years, it will rage like a California wildfire and destroy everything in its path especially The American Dream.

If you care  for and love our country as I do, take the time to pass this on just as I  did for you. NOTHING is going to happen if you don't!

             </p>
             <p>
              There's really only two ways to do it.
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                Storm government houses, forcibly remove cancer. Of course, all of those cunts with guns and government paychecks might intervene.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                Take down the power grid. Let the flotsam of society die off while the intelligent folk hole up on their acreages, armed to the tits. After a year, or two, forcibly retake at least a portion of our lands, and start anew.
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>

               nuclear dirty bombs do exist and they are in use everyday.
the nukes are a hoax to hide the existance of the real dangerous bombs, they are so illegal that even mentioning is illegal. these are chemical weapons.
heavy uranium shells are used everywhere, they say, but somehow that doesnt relate to a nuke or dirty bomb? nuclear fission or fusion is the lie, it doesnt work like that. if you study mainstream literature on nuclear power or bombs you will find a lot of inconsistencies and conflicting information. the lie is obvious. not even a nuclear power plant works by the principles that are advertized.
              </p>
              <p>
               you shouldnt be afraid of nukes, but be afraid of bombs and gas or electric weapons, they will kill you the same. ignorance of reality wont save anyone either.

                 i say the nukes are the boogieman, real or not, you can always say "at least we dont use nukes"... even when the millions of bombs you used had a much more devastating effect than a nuke could ever do, and you saved a lot of money, because face it huge nuclear bombs are expensive an ineffective, a million of small dirty uranium shells will cover a much wider area and are overall more efficient bombs.
                </p>
                <p>
                 and obviously the nwo has control over all radioactive material, and will sanction any "unauthorized" use of nuclear power. with the excuse of it being a potential nuclear bomb. like north korea for example. every use of nuclear power is prohibited "because" of the boogieman nukes, and negatively affects an economy that would otherwise benefit from the technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                 some say even fukushima is a hoax, at least they are hiding the full story.
but biological warfare is real, bombs have been fitted with contagious disease, its all been done by your own governemnt, but this doesnt cross the mind of the average dumb ass.
                </p>
                <p>
                 there is more to it thatn just the nukes being fake, just imagine the full potential of nuclear power, thats about space travel and then some. nuclear power can do a whole lot more than just generate power. the power companies are hiding this from the public.

                   antarctica treaty is another hoax. one side is the US, and the other side is the boogieman known as russia, the us and russia are playing a good-cop/bad-cop game on its citizens. look at philippines, the west canceled dutertes order of firearms, then he immediately turned to russia to get his guns delivered. everybody is being fooled here, the elites like to own antarctica, no matter how you look at it, russia or the "west" both sides of the same coin, all people enslaved by the jew.
cold war is the excuse to never stop the military industrial complex arms race, because previously to that, multiple times the leaders agreed to stop developing arms, but immediately the cold war was started and the arms race is on.

                    It goes back a lot farther than that, as well.

             That's quite the caveat. We're talking about unassimilated groups, not white American men.

             Since posting this, I've been looking into it and am discussing it with my wife. I haven't been able to find any sources that appear legitimate on this though. Nothing from a doctor saying it's bad or anything. I've looked at some of the sources linked here and they seem like shitty WordPress style websites with no one seemingly qualified to speak on the topic. I'm against vaccines, but those have actual qualified people speaking against them with good data that shows the danger.

              The fetal tissue is quite delicate.  The decibel level experienced by the fetus is similar to a freight train.  If you've been anywhere near a freight train when that horn goes off, you know what that means.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't trust any information from anyone.  Just think about how and why we evolved a certain way, and what the supposed benefits of the procedure are.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's almost no advantage to ultrasound a healthy fetus.  And if there's no reason to suspect the fetus is sick, there's almost no reason to test and see if it is.
             </p>
             <p>
              Good looking out looking into it yourself.  I looked into it extensively when my children were in utero and decided against it absolutely at that time.  Maybe the research has been memory holed?  The corporate control of information is almost complete.

            We know but ACTUALLY OP you may be lucky. Some people on the internet and in medical circles have the undrrstanding that ultra-sounds are the first part of DNA deterioration inside the womb.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have "NO PROOF" how this works or know any details. Read many papers back then by so called "natural birth adbocates" explaining how ultra-sounds are useless, dangerous, and DNA attacking due to Frequency radiation of unformed weak baby tissue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you reading?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also have your wife stay THE FUCK AWAY from Microwaves, Cellphone towers, Wifi hubs, and her own cellphone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Congrats op. Stay safe.

            See if you can get a referral to have the ultrasound done somewhere else. They tried to pull this when I found out I was pregnant, if it was in hospital, but if they referred it out to a different imaging place i COULD bring my husband. So glad I did too, because I probably would have driven off the road in sadness when the US showed no heart beat, if I had to deal with that alone.

            i was in the same boat as you recently, pregnant wife with baby getting first ultrasound, they told me i cant come in... so i just stood outside the door and waited.. they eventually felt bad enough and "snuck" me in...
           </p>

            I agree and it can be a hard path to follow...being insistent, firm, quiet, and calm (especially in hospitals).  Honestly I wouldn't let someone go alone to the hospital and we stick together when we go but that is the ONE room they have always tried to keep me out of for space reasons (and if this is first ultra sound you likely won't be able to "see" anything and they won't tell you anything either); although that may have changed with the WHO protocols being used

            “How the FUCK are we still being forced to pretend we're in a God damned fucking pandemic? I can't go to the first ultrasound with my pregnant wife and see my baby with her for the first time.” D’yer think that if humans had been following the primary directive (ensuring survival of the species), they might have been in a better position to respond to this inconvenient confrontation with reality?

            If your doctor is that stupid to go along with the fake non serious flu then you need a new doctor.    I changed for that reason myself.  It was a blessing. And my new Doctor is from Sweden.   What are the odds of that?   Do what you and your wife needs to do to change.   But remember this,  for thousands of years we have had many babies without ultrasound or even seeing a doctor.  If your both healthy , have the baby at home like the good old days.   😉

             I don't think it's the doctor himself making the call. I'm fairly certain it's the hospital. I understand that humans have done it that way for thousands of years, but we also used to have incredibly high infant mortality rates. (I am unironically open to the possibility that we may not have had higher infant mortality rates, or even had better rates back in the day though)

              Simple question,  are you alive today because of your ancestors?     1000s of years. We did just fine until they started putting shit in our bodies.  We were actually healthier back then.  Example. My dad showed my teenagers genealogy which goes back to the 1600s in our family,  one daughter realized we used to live longer back then.  Hmmmmm.   But if you end up watching Bill nye the science guy he will tell you we lived shorter lives back then.  My family’s death records don’t lie. But today’s paid science academia on tv does.  My daughter is now doing more work on this for hs project later. It might wake up the rest of the students.  My dad can’t do genealogy anymore because he has dementia and Alzheimer’s.  Thanks to probably fucking aluminum.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was Very serious into genealogy ,  As an airline pilot he always flew to Europe doing more work on genealogy and my ancestors from Germany Sweden Switzerland Ireland and France    He worked on it for almost 50 years.  He did his hardest to try to find any paper trail he could , the farther you go back the harder it is to get records of your family.  Probably because paper was so shitty back then too unless it was kept in a vacuum chamber.

               Oh I agree completely that we were healthier back then, but as I learned at grandma's funeral last recently, her parents had 6 children and 3 of them died in infancy.

                 Lol no. They were pentacostal. She went on to have 6 kids herself. My grandma on the other side was Baptist and had 8 kids. I'm 29 now and just having my first. Wish I would have been taught my responsibility to have baby's sooner. My wife is just 27 though so we got about 8 years to pop out as many as we can. Fucking ziocuck Baptist upbringing never taught me how important heritage and legacy is. I had to learn it on my own.

            Australia is getting stricter but they’re going into the summer. And no one even mentions it or asks how that’s possible. Just gobble up what’s being pedaled.

            UK PM also let the cat out the bag that it’s all BS. He said he thinks things will be back to normal before Christmas. Just have to hold out until the US elections then watch it all disappear. We’re almost there

            Because of how widespread the satanic control over the West is. They have been gaining power for thousands of years. While white people have been pretending niggers and faggots are normal and healthy parts of society. We have some catching up to do. If you want to expediete this process, jews and niggers will have to die. Unless white people are willing to kill for their survival, shit will either not change or go really slow.

            Are you ready to kill? Because that's what it will take.

            The lockdowns and masks are politically motivated. The left is using them as a way to weaken Trump in the upcoming election. Democrats are not opposing them for this reason. Lockdowns are happening around the world for a larger purpose -- to compel everyone to get vaccinated and to carry identification to prove it. It's the first stage in a credit score system similar to what they are forced to endure in China. They have other purposes, all of which are perceived as beneficial by the left -- concealing the faces of Antifa terrorists; forcing the general population to submit to control; dehumanizing us all by taking away our face; symbolically sealing our lips so we can't speak out in protest. All of it is socio-political, and all of it is designed to take away our rights.

YOU WILL BE HARASSED AND THE LIFE OF YOUR CHILD AND WIFE WILL BE PUT AT RISK. FOR THEM NOT TO BE AT RISK YOUR BROTHERS NEED TO HAVE YOUR BACK AND ERADICATE THE "VIRUS"

            We just had our first ultrasound today too. The psycho bitch doctor went on a five minute rant about how the country denies science, we need a president who understands the health crisis, we need the fake ass influenza vaccine, and they want my wife to wear a mask while she gives birth. I wanted to smack the midwit.

              I meant like smack some sense into her. I was trying to be humorous. Also, do you really think these people respond well to arguments? Her behavior was highly erratic. Her voice was getting shrill and her movements were strange. No reason to engage. Better to just go somewhere else.

               She's using her medical knowledge to help you and your baby. If you think the midwife doing this makes her a "psycho bitch", stay away from the hospital and have your baby at home. She's using what she learned in medical college to actually help you.

                Ah I see your angle now. Can you tell me where she was 'using her medical knowledge to help you and your baby'? She ranted about trump and the country when her first priority should have been the child and my wife. She pushed an influenza vaccine which has NOT been tested on pregnant women, which is beside the point because it's also completely unnecessary, and she wants my wife to wear a mask over her face whole giving birth. Yes she is a psycho bitch.

             Yeah, I was unaware of it. Come to think of it my unborn child last year died between the first and second ultrasound. There was no recorded growth from a couple of days after the first ultrasound to a few weeks later when we went back. I'm considering this a high risk pregnancy due to last year's miscarriage and I suspect that it might be twins. I'm very conflicted on what to do.

              Brother. Pray. I'm a witch. Not Christian. Idgaf. How you are raised. But put it out there. What do I do to protect my child. Pray to the wind who cares. Just reach out. Ask the ancestors... what ever speaks to you in a full thought. Ask ask ask... then let it settle. You will know what to do. You will know if you seek the answers beyond yourself. Then you can lead your wife. People have these ultra sounds and are ok. And then we hear the opposite. Light a candle and imagine meeting your baby. Do everything you can for your little one.

            we have to hope that they push it too far before they have their 'final solution' ready to go.
           </p>
           <p>
            thats the problem we have in victoria at the moment. too many retarded people watching carefully curated tv and social media to make sure anything contradictory or that might send an npc into a negative feedback loop is hidden.
           </p>
           <p>
            the rest of the world is already waking up and these retards here cant put two and two together, nor will they until it hits them one by one and by then its too late. we are talking about people that
            <em>
             do not give a single solitary fuck
            </em>
            about
            <em>
             other adults let alone children
            </em>
            but the very second you tell their child
            <em>
             no
            </em>
            rightfully or wrongfully they flip their shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have one of two chances here. Either summer comes about everyone starts hitting parks and beaches and get personally fined or dealt with
            <em>
             then
            </em>
            people slowly turn from "should have followed the rules" to "but my sister/brother shouldnt have to go through this because...." to "how fucking dare you tell my kids to mask up all they did was walk across the street to pat a dog
            <em>
             its only oooooooooooooh now i get it.....
            </em>
            "
           </p>
           <p>
            OR... OR... these fucking idiots remain that selfish long enough that TV controls them and all it takes is the trucks rolling out like the fucking warsaw ghetto and its all over.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is why whites are losing. Selfishness. At least here in Australia. Its been going on for fucking decades here and its always made me sick.
           </p>
           <p>
            And if we manage to somehow avoid all of this those same cunts will be the first to point at people like me and
            <em>
             still
            </em>
            claim "it wouldnt happen if you had just followed the rules" - no cunt, it would not have happened
            <em>
             IF YOU
            </em>
            had not followed the rules.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the next wave to be blamed on Covid that will be blamed on non mask wearers? Oh no it wont actually be covid at all. It will be people getting sick from wearing masks all the time, and
            <em>
             that
            </em>
            will be
            <em>
             also
            </em>
            massaged into not being the fault of someone inappropriately using them, but the fault of the
            <em>
             healthy
            </em>
            people around them who
            <em>
             refused from day one
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Good bet we were told about HCQ not for covid itself, but for the illnesses that are about to start going around due to people wearing the masks, that may very well be the trump card.

            I got to see my wife's ultrasound just fine. That is fucked. They did make me wait out in the hallway until my wife was called. Also there is a fat cunt in the hallway asking people if they have the 'vid... like just strait up asking. Some life saving measure that is. I bet that fat cunt Pat's herself on the back and thinks she is doing something meaningful.

            Ask your doctor to prove a single Death form this virus. The CDC has admitted that ONLY 9200 have actually died FROM Covid. Then ask them to compare that to H1N1, Sars, the swine flu, OR the yearly flu. NO ONE is asking because it is a LIE.

            Sorry brother. Having a kid is the best thing ever. This will be a distant memory for all the great years to come. Everyome will tell you it goes fast. That is an understatement.  Be the dad who drives the kids around. It buys a ton of extra time with them and you get a good insight to their friends. Good luck and enjoy the moments. This will pass.

            I feel you man. My wife just had her first ultrasound a couple of weeks ago and I couldn't be there. It fucking sucks. It makes me hate these fucking liberal assholes with a vehemence I rarely feel. If there's one thing they want to destroy, it's fatherhood.

            One needs to evaluate the politicians in control of the state.  Also, the medical industry is seriously corrupt.  It is what the current administration is currently fighting or "Draining the Swamp".  I hope the situation changes for you - important events for you and your wife.  God Bless.

            To be honest, I don't think you'll miss much with the ultrasound. I couldn't attend that due to work, so my wife made a video from her phone, and some facilities will email you video/photos directly from the source.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I can't imagine not being there for the birth. Hopefully they'll let you be there for that when the time comes.

            I'm so sorry you are having to miss out on these moments. I will say that for my daughter (pregnant at 29) I did NOT get a sonogram. There has been information that the sonogram can be "loud" and damaging to babies. My son (pregnant at 34) I only decided to get a sonogram because I did not feel him kicking at 19 weeks. Regardless- best of luck!!

            it is beyond retarded and there are not coincidences!.. plandemic comes along, to destroy trumps economy, mask are needed (no they are not!) if they worked doctors would have had their kids wearing them during flu seasons in the past and we would have toxic waste bins like hospitals have everywhere. this was planned it worked out perfect for masked idiots to riot and loot more easily.. it all lines up as a communist revolution we are livinf in it right now! the fires! the defund the police bullshit

            Sorry brother.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when you do,  let me tell you a story of our trip to do an ultrasound.
           </p>
           <p>
            My wife's phone went off with her favourite tune while doing an ultrasound and the baby smiled on the screen. Kid was at the second trimester.
           </p>
           <p>
            So now,  whenever I hear it's just a clump of cells I tell the idiots the story and even show the video.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were, try doing it and recording it yourselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck to both of you.

            Yeah we know shills pushing all sorts of bs infest this and other message boards here and everywhere else .. we are gonna say you are one of them, that you do not have a wife nor is she preggers that you are beating the ultrasound drum on behalf of genocidal interests who want autism and birth defect levels to increase among the target - white - population.

             Ultrasound appears to have set the human specie on a tragic path due to the subtle and not so subtle effects of ultrasound exposure, critics argue the exponential rise in autism incidence is a product of fetal exposure to ultrasound.

            <p>
             Chinese scientists measured damage to the brain, kidney, cornea, chorionic villi, and the immune system. They determined the amount of ultrasound exposure required to produce damage to the human fetus, and that amount was found to be very low. Ultrasound hazards to the human fetus were confirmed without doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Chinese studies were unknown in the Western realm and little known even in the East. These represent 23 years of critical research, from 1988 to 2011. Unfortunately, these studies were overwhelmed by a tremendous flood of studies that promote medical and therapeutic innovations for ultrasound.

             My wife's pregnant, and I've also looked into this. I think you're overstating the danger, but I agree it's not totally safe like people act.
            </p>
            <p>
             The synopsis of the papers I read is that.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               There aren't many studies on the long term effects of ultrasounds.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Many of the ones that were done took place 2 decades ago, and ultrasounds have increased in power by a factor of 10 since then.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Studies
               <em>
                have
               </em>
               shown small correlations to negative outcomes from ultrasounds. They haven't found anything shocking that I'm aware of, but they didn't find nothing. Interestingly, among other things there was a statistically significant increase in left-handedness in those receiving ultrasounds.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Ultrasound does have well understood mechanisms of damage. It can be used intentionally to destroy tumors in fact. As a result the FDA requires ultrasound machines to display risk indexes for localized heating, and cavitation damage (the two known mechanisms). Alarmingly, a survey of ultrasound techs showed less than 50% understood what these numbers mean...
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Based on what I read, we've turned down any ultrasounds that are "optional". And I've told my wife not to use the heartbeat doppler her sister gave her.

             I read the link you posted, and I think maybe I need to do more research.

            In the last 6 months of shutdown, EVERYONE EVERYWHERE has been wearing a mask. I have yet to see ANYONE cough in that time. I have seen more sick people in a week during flu season, than in the entire last 6 months. Yet I'm supposed to wear a mask, like everyone else, because they help stop the spread of disease, when you're coughing. This is like forcing everyone to wear a condom, because casual sex is a thing. Except in this case, casual sex is an actual thing.

             i teach first aid. thats my job. we are exempt. ive had one single solitary person i have had to ask to go grab a glass of water and come back because he went into coughing fits and i had to say
             <em>
              something
             </em>
             about it lest get ripped into by some cunt jumping on facebook and telling the world i was making everyone sick. Thats it. Ive not been sick
             <em>
              once
             </em>
             - what i
             <em>
              have
             </em>
             done since day one, was tell my students to make sure they drink lots of indian tonic water, orange juice, and a multivitamin with zinc and selenium. some of them have ignored it, but many have asked why - tonic water has quinine (whats HCQ stand for? Vitamin C from your OJ which is good for you anyway, and part of the therapeutic treatments of covid is fuckin zinc. Guess what fauci was loose lipped and said he has plenty of? multivitamin with C and D... despite the WHO not liking people who say 'drink orange juice'

              My grandfather was 44 when his last child was born, and I don't think Grandma was much younger than him, if at all.  It can happen.  It's unlikely, but possible.  I would imagine it's more likely if it's not her first child (it was number 8 in Grandma's case).

               correct. if a woman has her first at a normal age then she can keep having them up until 45. for someone who has not had any children yet it gets much more difficult after 35.

             I would absolutely be doing a home birth, there are a lot of great midwives who more knowledgeable than the doctors. A wider breadth of holistic knowledge, passion and are always learning.

            I went through the whole circus.  Be firm and rude with hospital staff.  Your wife has trouble speaking English, she needs you there to interpret.  Whatever excuse you need.

            Don't get me started on the actual pregnancy.  It's a giant exercise in patience.  Good luck, fellow father

            We are surronded by braindead idiots.  Its all fake. This is what we get for being so nice and accomidating to them...  I. WANT. IT. TO. GET. WORSE.  way fucking worse.  That is the only we can get the change to stick.  If this ends in a week or a month or even a year then we will be balls deep in this bullshit again in 20 years.  No, I want to barely fucking survive this and I am likely more prepared than most.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should think along the lines of what I said here.  You have been ever so mildly disenfranchised from your expected daily desires.  You have had very minimal barriers placed in your path.  Notice how no one notices? They are training us like horses.  If they raise the bar to jump then the more likely we will be to accept it...  There used to be a time in this nation were there WERE NO TAXES.  There used to be a time in this nation where it was pretty much impossible to take someone's property.  Today any random bitch with a baby can take your shit let alone the government.  Stuff like that.  Take the time to really look back at it.  It started with fishing liscenses and a small fine.  Income tax on only the rich.  Drivers licenses because if you have to get a license then you CAN LOSE THAT LICENSE.  You just had a right to travel taken by force and sold back to you with restrictions.  Same with land ownership.  Now we have fee simple land and zoning and buiding codes and environmental restrictions and electrical permits on and on and on...  Used to be a thing called ALLODIAL TITLE.  Naw, now its fee simple.  Used to be you could simply buy a car and drive it... Now you can only buy and drive an approved automobile.  You certainly cant make your own!  You see my point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things have to get REALLY FUCKING BAD.  So bad that everything the normies take for normal is destroyed.  Like I said before...  I hope I just barely survive this shit.  I hope I can just keep my family alive.  We will emerge into a world populated only by people who are strong, smart and capable and prepared and tough and smart.  I hope the soft dont survive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things will never EVER go back to normal.  Normal is the problem.

             Amen. If we just go back to normal none of em will learn a goddamn thing. I’ve been vocal about the Scamdemic on normie social media since day 1, and pretty much everyone called me crazy and stupid at first. Now they’re slowly realizing that I was right and if I’m being honest i can’t wait to have the ultimate “told ya so”

             Too many are unnecessary and they are riskier than most doctors and technicians will tell you (I did have one honest/knowledge tech!)... But having said that it's highly likely that having the 20 week scan and some follow ups saved my baby's life, so my opinion is less harsh toward ultrasounds now.

            Were you physically stopped? Make them stop you. I'm finding that some people drop or take off their masks when you don't wear one. I've only had a few people give me shit about it and they couldn't even explain why they were mad about it.

            Bill gates and fauci are competing right now to see who can predict the longest amount of time they will be able to keep us doing this.  Fauci says fall 2021 and gates says spring 2022.  We need to kill these motherfuckers.  Where are the men with balls ready to do us this service?  Please i want to see the video of their deaths.  Kill them.

            There haven't been an unusual amount of deaths this season. The media keeps running with "cases", "number of cases" they never fucking stop. By any measure the pandemic, if it was one as it was no worse than any other year, ended months ago.

             Eh sometimes they run on about 100,000 dead or something.  A rounding error in the population size of the United States, and certainly far fewer than the number of people who would normally die in a year.

               Yeah and they closed the gyms.  Although mine is back open.  It's pretty hilarious how it is full of people with no masks on, putting their sweaty balls all over everything, and no one gets sick.  In fact, the people in the gym are paragons of health compared to the pussies outside in their masks.

             Every morning on the way to work I turn on the local (((talk radio))) and count the seconds. Not fucking once in six months plus have I made it to fifteen before the word covid comes up. Usually less than ten. They’ve been hammering the same shit over and over and over for six months. That and Trump is ten points behind with a dash of peaceful protests. It’s disgusting. Sanctimonious sacks of shit lying through their teeth for jew favor. Hope they get what’s coming.

             You hear about schools being suspended because “34 students test positive for Cohen-19.” And what we’re not seeing is that those 34 students are kids now at home happily playing video games or messing around in the backyard.
            </p>
            <p>
             It all depends on the fraudulent and unscientific “testing kits.” That was the linchpin of this hoax. Combine that with the fact that hospitals are basically government agencies, bribed for every positive case, and there’s your fake pandemic in a nutshell.

              weve had a video from the Austin Hospital in Melbourne where a dude is walking about i think he was there for a procedure because he had to gown up for something but hes hidden his phone...
             </p>
             <p>
              ... not one of any of the medical staff walking around had a mask around their neck let alone on their face... and you know why?
             </p>
             <p>
              because theyre not appropriate and they make them sick. they know this. those posers wearing them 'all the time' are not medical people, and if they are, theyre the fucking stupid ones.
             </p>
             <p>
              ive also had a lot of medical staff that have been laid off coming through my classes for retraining into other industries and a thought occured to me.... ... theyre sacking staff with ethics and brains who will say no to things and replacing them with the same fucking niggers that you get in nursing homes where they rob and kill people and cover it up with paperwork and excuses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Theyre replacing actual decent nursing staff with bottom of the barrel shit they can easily control by letting them fuck up, then blackmailing them into doing other things or they will get jailed or deported, and to get more of them there will be all kinds of 'labour shortages' requiring the import of foreigners that can have their visas revoked easily.

             The moast likely explanation would be that you're in a Red state [or a strongly Red area within a blue state], whereas they're not.

             The difference between blue &amp; Red attitudes is like the difference between night &amp; Day.

              That might seem most likely; but reality is actually rather complicated. Some of the fare is very blue. I am simply assertive and polite. Sometimes I have to yield a bit, but they are always understanding. So far 100% of the time.

            It's so retarded. You can walk into a restaurant of 50+ people dining with no masks on but you can't go to an ultrasound appointment. I'm so sorry they're doing this to you. I just had our second three months ago, my husband wasn't allowed at any of the appointments either. But he was allowed at the birth, thank God.

             I am glad it all worked out...in the future tell him they can't keep him out and can't deny you service.  It is worth picking your battles, I understand.  I hope we get to have our third at home (Oct/Nov) like the rest...this is the LAST time I want to be going to hospitals

              I hope you get to have yours at home, too! I wouldn't want to put up with the extra regulations they have right now. Fortunately I had mine in a birthing center and we got to leave for home only a few hours after birth. But get this, on my 3rd day of postpartum, my toddler conked his head and it was bad, he needed stitches. We went to the emergency room and I'm a wreck, holding a bloody toddler with my newborn at home with my mom. There's no one in the lobby so it looks like we're going to go right in. Suddenly an older obese man  comes in a wheelchair complaining of breathing problems. I overhear them getting his details and they ask, "how long have you been having this?" He goes, "about a year". WTF. Of course they let him back first and we had to wait. I was so mad, I really wanted to cuss him out. Then they only let one of us go back with our son, so my husband had to wait in the lobby while our son was sedated with freaking ketamine! and stitched up. It was horrible.

             Congratulations on the healthy baby. I'm fucking worried for my wife. I'm going to be right outside the hospital waiting on video call. We had a late miscarriage last year that required a DnC when we went for the 2nd check up there was no heart beat. I'm fucking terrified of that happeneing and me not being right there with my wife.

              Miscarriages suck ass. My wife had 2 so far. And both weren't viable as she got pregnant when she was still breast feeding, so her body was like "nope. 1 Kid at a time." Pretty obvious we lack any nigger genes.

               We traded a MC and a living child for our first 2 and our thirst is going to be here soon.  I wish I would have been more help to my wife at those times.

              Thank you. A healthy baby is all that matters and I'll be praying for you and your wife. It sounds like you've both been through hell. I'm sorry for the loss of your little one. Please, Father God, be with this family. Wrap your armor of protection around them at all times and give them comfort and peace. Bless them with a healthy baby, a joyful pregnancy, and easy delivery. We thank you for this miracle of life and the honor to be parents. Give us the strength we need to get through these difficult times. In Jesus's name, amen.

               Update: at 8 weeks and 2 days the baby is healthy. We lied and told them it's part of our religion and that I have to be there. Told them we were Muslim haha. We're both white as fuck but they didn't dare question it. Fucking retards. "sorry there's this supposedly extremely deadly disease that requires families to be separated at important moments. 'oh your a Islamarino?, sorry sir right this way'"

               There is more than the healthy baby although I agree that is paramount.  These are the times we can shine as beacons to our wives; the times they need us most are the times when we can grow outside our current limits (and sometimes fail at that)

                 Don't start there.  Obviously being vegan is retarded but laying blame on a woman for something like a miscarriage is an awful thing to do.  Miscarriages are incredibly common and often have no distinguishable causing factor.   You can hurt (even stranger) women incredibly with this type of talk, fyi

                  You jump from one extreme to the other, although I would admit I would prefer the latter if I had to choose. There are few places in the world where genes adapted to live on meat only, and it is typically very special meat.  Check you teeth and check your gut...I think "green smoothies" are retarded but you should definitely be consuming some nutrient dense veggies or even micro greens or something.

                  While low carb no sugar diet is the best, carnivore diet is not necessarily the best for everyone. Ancestral diet is the best, which mostly translates into an animal based, not just meat, diet.  You need to have eggs, cream, cheese, tendons, marrow, etc.  Berries are usually included too, as are some  tubers sometimes.  While I’m not convinced yet, there’s a lot of evidence our ancestors went out of their way to get honey in their diet. Even the oft cited eskimos would try to get some carbs if can, or would definitely hunt deers in mating season for their thyroid (carbs seem to be very useful for thyroid function).

                  A carnivore diet strictly, or mostly, based on just meat is only necessary for severe autoimmune issues, mikhaela peterson being a classic example.

                   Yeah I get it, Im not a hardliner "meat water salt thats it" kind of person either. I feel like as it is though, most people have too many plants and not enough meat. I managed to reverse a chronic skin condition with this diet and feel more energy than I ever have, and no more back pain which I suffered with previously. Anything that pulls away from SAD and carb heavy diets is better.

                 Idk why women would think that's OK. Me and my wife typically follow a low carb low sugar diet, but during pregnancy we make sure to keep it more balanced. That went for the last one as well. We don't know what caused the miscarriage last time. We both quit smoking/drinking as soon as we learned of the last pregnancy and never picked it back up. I'm being crazy careful this time though. I won't let her eat anything without me looking up if it's safe first lol. Made her pour out her ginger water because I looked it up and ginger is bad for pregnant women.

                  So, as I said earlier, I’m sorry for your loss, and this time it will go great.  But I just wanted to point out the health of pregnancy, and ultimately the baby, is determined long before pregnancy. Many people quit bad habits when they get pregnant. While that’s very good for the course of pregnancy, the most important things are already decided by the time the woman gets pregnant. Adopting good healthy lifestyle at the onset of pregnancy might be too late in certain cases.  So what one needs to do is ideally live a healthy lifestyle long before pregnancy, but that’s nigh impossible. So the best thing to do is start living healthily six months before pregnancy.  Both father and mother need to stop smoking and limit drinking, and eat nutrient dense food good for egg and sperm health.  This is actually observed in ancestral history as well as some current tribal peoples. Anyway, you will get a healthy baby this time around, the odds are in your favour, as are our prayers.

                  dude, I understand your anxiety, but if you look up ANY kind of food it will give you some bullshit reason why pregnant women cant have it. They recommended to women a bullshit high carb diet that induces gestatiinal diabetes, putting your baby in real danger, and setting them up for health problems. Keep your low carb low sugar diet through pregnancy and the baby will thrive. Ignore doctors who have exactly zero knowledge of nutrition, and generally recommended the high carb low fat Standard American Diet.

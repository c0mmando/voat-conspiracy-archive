            The US is just as guilty of funding the the terrorists, if not even more guilty than Turkey. Erdogan just does a bad job of hiding it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scariest part in all of this is that we know our government is over there funding and training ISIS using our tax payer funds, funnelling in "refugees" and doing any number of illegal and dangerous activities to accomplish God-knows-what foreign policy goals (besides maintiang dollar denominated oil markets of course) while the collusive corporate media covera for them, and there is literally nothing we can do about it.

            The USA spent over a year "bombing" ISIL/ISIS/DEASH.(With many EU countries)
           </p>
           <p>
            What came of it? Not much. The US crazies want everyone to lay down and obey in the middle east.
           </p>
           <p>
            Iraq has woken up, after russia started it's bombing campaign. (actually getting shit handled, allowing them to actually defend themselves.) Russia (iran, china) is now pissing off the general world populous,(Cause the news says so...) because it is getting shit done, and seriously wounding ISIS/ISIL/DEASH  in syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            This hurts turkey, because the president/pm/god-king is losing money from oil transfers that don't happen.(For his son.) So basicly: Russia bombs some oil field/taqnker shit, It scares/hurts turkey from loss of income, As well as fucking up the USA's plans of usurping the whole syrian government.(Cause their "moderate rebels" are getting ass-raped) Suddenly Turkey will try to play the hard-ass, and shoot down a plane, because "Who will fuck with a NATO backed country?" Russia's response is a great big "FUCK YOU!" To anyone who doesn't have their newest, top of the line, anti-aircraft/missle/icbm batteries, or jamming tech.
           </p>
           <p>
            End response(?): The USA will dump even more stolen taxpayer cash to try to destabilize the planet to their ends. "Conspiracy?" You tell me...

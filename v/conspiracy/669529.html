   The surveillance state fails to protect us from crime. Is there any hard evidence of these capabilities? Were the Snowden revelations just a forgery to create an environment of self censorship?

            I've been thinking myself that there's something fishy about snowden. If they didn't want him to leak he would have been dead a long time ago. Instead he has become a public figure like polititians and actors. He is twittering and giving interviews and always sounds very articulate and well prepared. Has a beautiful girlfriend - but hey - i guess being a crypto nerd has its advantages.

            ah yes, so you want to suggest it's a mind control deal, which is certainly possible, but this requires some evidence.  find some people he was around that could have led to that for starters.
           </p>
           <p>
            meanwhile i'm suggesting the more likely truth - that this misguided piece of shit is a natural product of our toxic culture.

            look buddy, if you can't see that this guy in Charleston was motivated by notoriety I'm not going to third-grader explain it to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            my point is that you are entirely correct regarding workplace and school shootings and the media response.  Those rarely happen for purposes of notoriety and a thorough examination of them would be unbelievably beneficial to US culture.  I recommend reading "Going Postal" by Mark Ames if you really want to dig into the topic.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the case of dirtbags like Charleston boy - he's not frustrated by his environment in some way and the people he attacked were not directly responsible for his wrath.  He just went after them as symbols.  That's what's different and what's fucked up here.  He killed a bunch of random people for the glory.   He killed them because they represented some idea to him.  There was no reality to his action - it's the height of celebrity and fame culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            A guy who blasts his dickhead boss?  Totally different.  My other post seeks to separate these two - your desire to make them one in the same type of event is extremely counterproductive and that's why I pointed it out.  If that's not your INTENTION then you should see that I'm being helpful and agreeing with you most of the way.  If it IS your intention, well, fuck off.

            Just like 22 july 2011 here in Norway, the only thing the puppet who followed his orders from the knights templar wanted was to have his face and name known, for what he had done. The Norwegian media granted his wish, and still they print his name, 4 years later. Although everytime i hear someone say it, i tell them why i do not use it. Ive also talked to Master Freemasons (by chance with the father of the owner of a house me and my mother were renting once) who sat at the dinner table with us and said word for word "there are a lot of people who agree with what he did" before he corrected himself and added "not the killings mind you, but the philosophy (stopping the Islam religion from conquering the world, and yeah that's why he did it, true story)

             This is exactly correct.  Note the confederate flag flying high at the fucking state capitol of South Carolina right now - if that doesn't let you know who is in charge and how they feel I don't know what would.

             The first thing we have to do as a culture is defeat this "think positive" bullshit that prevents people from taking a hard look at reality and diagnosing it as such.  If we can only speak in kind, soft tones, we're blind to half the world.  We're also weaker than our opposition.

            I don't think that's really true in the case of the Charleston church shooting.  It is definitely true for workplace and school shootings - but this guy did it for the glory.  In that instance the correct advice is to not make them famous.  It was his only real motivation.

              not really - race was a vector through which he expressed his frustration with his life.  there's a reason most white power tards are teenagers.

                not necessarily.  I think he's got big problems - amateur psych stuff to diagnose, probably.  like most white power losers he is powerless and seizes on the movement to make himself feel important and strong.  as the white power people have a tendency toward extreme violence and racial hatred it's not unusual for their manifestations to take on such a tone.  he is certainly a high-achiever in this respect, which is where I get the idea that he was going for fame.
               </p>
               <p>
                had this angry misguided kid found something other than white power when he was searching he may well have acted otherwise.  I don't think he had a need to murder and only murdered black people because of white power - I think he had a need for love and it wasn't returned and he nurtured that feeling into hatred and THAT is why he did this crime.

                had his society offered him better alternatives he probably would have been fine.

             Exactly. He even left someone alive so she could speak to the media. In his mind, he's making a stand which deserves to be widely talked about, especially in the media. Not giving him the satisfaction is the most disappointing outcome for him.

            Yeah, I get where you're coming from.  If I can't put a name to a guy, I can't ridicule him.  And while the roman concept of

            I haven't seen any memes regarding this...  But stuff that, question everything. I want to know the names and details, I want to see if they have a facebook account that was only set up a few months ago and looks suspect, I want to hear from people that knew them and see what they have to say. False flag or not, things are always worth investigating to see what might come out of it. If we don't question and investigate we may miss so much that otherwise would go unnoticed.

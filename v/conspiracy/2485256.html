<p>I would think that Fitzgerald was the most important name.  It sounds like the Kennedys are something like Murphy.  An Irish Murphy quipped that they ran out of surnames and gave the remainder of Irish the name Murphy.

<p>Fitzgeralds were the Earls of Desmond and also called the &quot;Geraldines&quot;.  They were the ones revolting against the crown and then when England swatted them it was all the poor Irish who were in trouble. And, some of the Scottish soldiers brought in to defend the Geraldines (Fitzgeralds) were deported to the Caribbean as slaves and mixed in with African slaves but some of the black descendents have maintained O negative blood type indicative of Norse ancestry and which shows that male and females were deported as slaves since O negative is recessive and the whole blue baby syndrome if a father is Rh positive (probably some Irish women with the Scottish soldiers). </p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - my understanding is &quot;Fitz&quot; is a prefix for bastard children of the elite. As with the Rothschilds, Fitz offspring had certain privileges and  inheritance rights but were given plum jobs in banking and in the old Waterloo days were the packet (small boat) runners who had the jump on financial info from Europe for the City of London bosses.</p>
<p><strong>From Dr. Leuren Moret -</strong></p>
<p>I met a lot of what is left of the Norman land barons in Ireland, and even lambed 2000 ewes in the spring on one estate, owned by the Norman land baron family &quot;Naper&quot; (from the French words &quot;Na Peur&quot; which means &quot;no fear&quot;).  My sister married their youngest son.  I LOVED Ireland.  I also discovered a very early &quot;Moretti castle&quot; there (I have discovered in France that the &quot;Moret&quot; bloodline is Norman) in Ireland that has almost crumbled completely.  I also found out that from them that Lawrence of Arabia was one of them, and that he used to come to Ireland and stay with them on their Georgian Estate (Napers had to be Protestants from the Georgian period in Ireland).</p>
<p><strong>and . . .</strong></p>
<p>Barbara Bush and Laura Bush are &quot;Walker&quot; women, because US Presidents must marry into the Walker bloodline.  Recently I wondered why an American &quot;Walker&quot; woman married the heir to the Hapsburg throne. </p>
<p>C.Asian/Viking/Norman etc. bloodlines always go through the female in a breeding pair.  Norman tribal rules require &quot;Walker&quot; women (as direct Rollo descendants) to be the marital partner of US Presidents (Norman King Henry II\'s direct descendants).  All US Presidents are required to be direct descendants of the Norman King Henry II, (the direct descendant of William the Conquerer who was Rollo\'s great great great grandson) and the first Plantagenet King of England.</p>
<p>Rollo was the son (Prince) of the first King of Dublin, and the first Viking male to become the Duke of Normandy.  Rollo\'s nickname was &quot;the Walker&quot; because he was so large and tall that horses could not carry him.  Rollo always walked everywhere while his men rode small C.Asian horses.  His men called him &quot;the walker&quot;.   
</p>
<p>**So this makes it clear that it is likely Walker women may be directly descended from Rollo, and the US Pres. males descended from Rollo through the Norman/Plantagenet King Henry II, and Rollo\'s great great great grandson William the Conqueror. **</p>
<p>There has been over 1300 years of the Charlemaigne bloodline backbreeding rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, with the Rollo bloodline introduced 100 years later.  Rollo, a mid-800 AD Viking raider and terrorist was bought off by Charlemaigne\'s descendant French King Charles III (Charles the Simple) - with the Normandy region and the French title Count of Rouen.  He promised to stop raiding France and prevent other Vikings from raiding.  Through intermarriage of their bloodlines, France regained Normandy, Rollo established trading colonies in the Meditteranean, and Rollo\'s great great great grandson conquered the Brittish Isles.  A millenium later the Normans have conquered much of the world (British Commonwealth).</p>
<p>The Walker female is the most important in any breeding pair, as the direct bloodline of Rollo born as the son of the first Norwegian Viking King of Dublin.   
</p>
<p><strong>Here is the role of the St. Claires (de Clairs) after the Norman conquest of the British Isles.</strong></p>
<p>Bushes supposedly have Strongbow as an ancestor and the Irish king who invited him.  I had said St. Claire but have found it as Robert de Clare.  I was under the impression that Strongbow was well liked in Ireland and that it was the later Anglo-Irish who arrived ca 1500 who were protestants and who were disliked. The earlier arrivals were generally Catholic.  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/27/usa.angeliquechrisafis</a></p>
<p>According to the wikipedia article on the Fitzgeralds they are not Italian but Norman.</p>',

            That's fine as is, except "Fitz" is definitely "Fils de", or son of for Anglo-Norman French/Cambro-Norman (Cambro being for Wales).  Nothing to do with bastard or not.  That's a Scandinavian naming pattern and Wales used something similar. Up until fairly recently in Scandinavia you had to name your son after yourself to preserve the family name.  If not, each generation changes the surname.  That's how FitzMaurice morphed into FitzGerald.  Maurice had a son named Gerald FitzMaurice who had a son FitzGerald, etc..... If you were Scandinavian and wanted to maintain the surname Johnson, for instance, then the son had to be named John for each generation.

            From Wales you see that in surnames like James, where the earlier ancestor was named James.  If I see someone that has the first and last name as something like Charles, then I guess they are either Haitian or Welsh or from northern France.  Most of the French who went into Haiti were from the north, I think.

            Another unusual thing which appears in Tribes of Galway who are "Old English" (aka Anglo-Norman, Cambro-Norman) is using a double small letter instead of caps.  Thus, one of the Tribes of Galway is named ffrench, which we would spell French.

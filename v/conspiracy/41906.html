            To be honest, I would have to do some research myself, as I don't know much about the CDC. I mainly just wanted it to be known that those are in fact ingredients in vaccines, and from there people can do as they wish. Intuitively, those are 5 things I definitely don't want to put in my bloodstream (well, a mix of intuition and science) but you can just as easily find info that will tell you not to worry about them in small quantities.

            Water fluoride is interesting, it's too late for me to look for many links but off the top of my head... It's a different compound that is added to water, much more toxic than the one that occurs naturally, because a lack of calcium.
            <a href="http://www.fluoridedebate.com/question03.html">
             Link.
            </a>
            Basically I've read it's known to cause cancer and other diseases, it was allowed in the water supply to help out a company that produces it as a toxic byproduct, it's not actually that good for our teeth, and over time it calcifies soft tissue in our body. Interestingly enough, I've read that the first thing to calcify is the pineal gland.

            (the first paragraph sums up fluoride that's added to water).
           </p>
           <p>
            You can probably google most of the other stuff, but if not I'll provide some links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I've always found it interesting that fluoride is added to the only 2 things I can think of that we're all guaranteed to consume daily. Toothpaste sort of makes sense, if you believe that fluoride helps our teeth, but water? That's just forced medication. You can go get a cream made of it and rub it on your teeth if you're so inclined but instead some people are forced to drink it daily.

            Really? If you live somewhere near where one of my friends who are docs live I'm sure that, if you pay them, they will gladly inject you with "vaccine quantities" of aluminum, formaldehyde, and mercury--although they will likely make you sign about 1000 waivers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll even raise the stakes--if you are near LA, New York, Chicago, or Miami I will PERSONALLY pay you $200 upon verification from one of said doctors that you accepted the injections--and of course pay for the doctor visit and the toxins. PLUS I'll pay you for your gasoline expenses (by car). That's a pretty good deal to be injected with "harmless" substances, is it not?
           </p>
           <p>
            So how about it? Interested?

            If by "harmless" you mean "incredibly harmful if injected into the human body--or into the body of any other warm-blooded mammal" then you are certainly correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is serious (and this statement it so ludicrous I hope that it's not) I would HIGHLY suggest that you look up toxicity levels for Al, Hg, and formaldehyde!
           </p>
           <p>
            Formaldehyde (one of the component chemicals that NutraSweet is broken down into) is then broken down further into formic acid...AKA ant poison.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aluminum has been positively blamed for causing early-onset dementia and Alzheimers' Disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mercury...where do we start? It has killed THOUSANDS of people through history. The vapor is super-toxic, and the metal is a cumulative poison.
           </p>
           <p>
            MSG messes with the neurotransmitters that carry signals across synapses. This causes tardive dyskinesia in the BEST cases. True, it does take quite a bit though.
           </p>
           <p>
            These chemicals (adjutants) are
            <em>
             anything
            </em>
            but harmless. Especially if aerosolized or injected into the body either IV, IM, or subcutaneously.

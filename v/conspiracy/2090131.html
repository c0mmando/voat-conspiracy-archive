            I think this has more to do with the fact that yt is becoming more mainstream and widely used.
Once things hit a certain threshold and are considered public "utilities" (or however you want to refer to this) they are regulated as such.
This is why the FCC was in control of radio and television, why you couldn't just up and start your own broadcasting network because they don't want you to broadcast lolicon to millions of people across the nation.
Also why wal-mart never allowed naughty music or movies.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just a call for a new better alternative to youtube, then yt acts as the video hosting site for the masses.

            true, but instead, we have luddites creating content using magic they don't understand, nor are they even aware of what they're emulating.

            there are greater issues here. youtube is bound to die. not because of censorship, but because usenet, friendster, myspace, and facebook all die.
           </p>
           <p>
            it's not yet mandatory to enroll for a network, and the luddites have already begun siloing off from one another—the antithesis of internet/information, so who fucking cares what happens to youtube.

             This is why identity politics are dangerous. They only work on a national scale in the short term.  Hence why obama won two terms.

             In the end, they put the majority against the minority, if there is no clear majority then a new one rises. Hence why we have seen the growing red tide in America.

             I think the Jewish element will speed up the destruction of the establishment.

            <p>
             The Jews are not known for taking care of things. Harvard and the rest of the Ivy leagues are dilapidated and are not taken seriously. Their political machine is a joke. Hollywood is being taken over by foreigners.

            <p>
             They are a cursed people who bring about their own destruction because they don't care about anyone other than themselves. I would argue that Satan's fall from heaven was a warning to them from God in the Bible, about how easy it is to fall from grace when you are chosen, but they clearly do not pay attention.

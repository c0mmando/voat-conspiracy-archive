<p>There was a 64% reduction in the risk of mortality in children who were given two doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A as compared to placebo. Two doses of water based vitamin A were associated with a 81% reduction in risk of mortality as compared to 48% seen in two doses of oil based preparation. <strong>Two doses of oil and water based vitamin A were associated with a 82% reduction in the risk of mortality</strong>

<p>A study in the American Journal of Public Health, “Measles mortality in the United States 1971-1975,” found the <strong>measles death rate to be almost 10 times higher among families whose median income was less than $5,000</strong> than among families whose income exceeded a modest $10,000. Families outside metropolitan areas, who tended to have poor healthcare, had three times the death rate. Measles didn’t only discriminate by income — in another study, Barkin found that children with underlying diseases were particularly vulnerable, and that the “majority of this group were physically or mentally retarded, or both.” The realization that measles was selective in whom it killed led Barkin to emphasize that <strong>vulnerable populations, rather than the general population, should be targeted for measles vaccination</strong>..... vaccinated mothers have little antibody to pass on — only about one-quarter as much as mothers protected by natural measles..... in recent years, the new vaccination regime, too, has been failing, with widespread outbreaks again occurring, including among those who have received the recommended dose and especially among infants too young to be vaccinated, and thus unprotected because their mothers had been vaccinated. Now health experts, scrambling to find solutions, are suggesting numerous reforms, including earlier child vaccinations and second doses for adults..[source]</p>

<p><strong>50% lower chance of even getting measles with vitamin A.</strong> reported a 24% reduction in all cause mortality (rate ratio=0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.83). Seven trials reported a 28% reduction in mortality associated with diarrhoea (0.72, 0.57 to 0.91). Vitamin A supplementation was associated with a reduced incidence of diarrhoea (0.85, 0.82 to 0.87) and measles (0.50, 0.37 to 0.67) and a reduced prevalence of vision problems, including night blindness (0.32, 0.21 to 0.50) and xerophthalmia (0.31, 0.22 to 0.45).

<p>tl:dr; In a first world country, with good nutrition and medicine, chances of anything harmful happening to you because of measles are pretty friggin tiny. Third world countries with shitty medical systems and shitty nutrition are the ones that need to have mass vaccination campaigns.</p>',

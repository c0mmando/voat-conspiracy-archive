            The war was probably a multi-purpose thing, as most wars tend to be. Isn't there also some oil pipeline in the region that the US and russia were fighting a proxy war for control of?

             Yes, there are multiple reasons, and this is definitely one of them.  I am hoping the NWO pulled the trigger too early on their treasonous scheme to establish a one world government.  I believe they are arrogant enough to do so.  Trump winning the election must have been an unexpected problem, but they probably thought they could probably buy him off like all the other politicians.  I hope it is not the case.

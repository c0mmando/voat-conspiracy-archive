There had been some sexy pic of his gf taken and like so many other people on the planet, they had been somehow magically put on the net. Well as you can probably guess he wanted to know how to get them taken down and how to find who posted them. I went on to explain the hard truth ( Don\'t take nude pics, they end on on the net ) that I could probably get them taken down from that site but most likely not find the person. Well after I talked to him I check some things out (Site A usa  .anon-ib.ru/pa/ ) and found out that there was an abnormally large amount of people I knew with pics on this site ( I live in rural Pa.). And that some of them would never put them on the net themselves. So I did a little more digging and found from using Imgops that a lot of the pic on Site A was on this other site. Site B was basically the same kinda page, just modern and was owned by a different company ( Site B sextingpics ). After checking the page out and using imaops there was a lot of pics from Site A on Site B. So using the logic that if the person that posted the pics of my buddy\'s Gf on Site A there was Good chance that he mite have posted on Site B as well, Allowing for cross referencing data (See if maybe I could get A Ip or any info to point to a person) Now this is where I get a little nervous writing this. I looked up both sites via whois. Just to make sure it weren\'t a sister site or something like that (cross referencing don\'t work with the same data). Site a has heavy ties with Russia. And did not list any real usable info, they protected their user info. Site B did net some info. So I looked into the person, yes it was not a company. It was a solo person. So I looked him up. Well what I found Next was A tab bit more complexing. It turns out this dude works a MAJOR NBA team. Like WTF. At this point Im engaged this is way out there stuff. Did more checking. Dude had a few more site with basically the same content. Im like wow How could this be. And yes there was some very questionable (Owner did not post, or looks to be underage) Pics on said sites. So I dig deeper. Dude got 5 Fake twitter accounts, All for the posting of nude pics, thousands of pics. Now I get to thinking that is alot and I mean alot of work for ONE guy to do. So I really start to dig on the guy. Not that old, early 30\'s. Looks to be well off, travels a shit ton. Is from a Hungarian descent ( Remember this FACT). Nothing that really screams that this guy could be one of the USA biggest owners of sexting pics. So I was looking at his twitter page when I saw Him Next to the NBA Title wearing A RNC staff shirt and pass. Wait what....WTF. Yes he also worked for the RNC. You know that convention that was supposed to have been HACKED by Russian Hackers. Yet no proof was found. Now lets think back to the DNC Hack and How Hillary Email Thing Happened. The DNC was Hacked by Russian hackers. (Fact) and This was Hillary. On July 7, the State Department reopened its probe into the email controversy. On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI has started looking into newly discovered emails that may be pertinent to the case. Law enforcement officials stated the emails were found on a laptop belonging to Clinton aide Huma Abedin\'s husband, Anthony Weiner, during an investigation of his sexting scandals (Sexting, Really WTF, Like the same fucking thing Im finding). So now Im like what do I do. Is this all real, did I just go bat shit crazy. IS THIS THE MATRIX??? Should I dig deeper? I have AN idea of what happened at the RNC.</p>
<p>Theories:
1. The pics are a front to move data to a 3rd party using  steganography to hide the info attained @ RNC.
2. The pics was a test of a new hacking method of mobile devices on public networks. I.E you connect to a public network and all data from said mobile device is stolen. Just think of all thos RNC attendants getting there data stolen just from connecting to a access point.</p>',

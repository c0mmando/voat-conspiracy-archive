            Meh. I'm surprisingly okay with this. See? The killer was white. That's the story, Middle Eastern migrant. Stay away from Mr. Charlie. He's one scary cracker. Don't trouble Mr. Charlie. Just say out his malls, his airplanes, his countries, and for God's sake don't stick
            <em>
             anything
            </em>
            in his women. Just leave that psychopath cracker to his own self.

            I might be in the minority here believing that Sandy Hook and other attacks were just mentally ill people, but this one was just too perfect to be just a mentally ill person.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing is that photos taken by killers during attacks are usually taken down very quickly -- the shooter in Paris filmed some of the attack in the supermarket and it was never released, several US shooters have filmed things that were never released -- but photos of this guy
            <em>
             in the middle of the attack
            </em>
            were all over the media within hours. It's like it was staged to prove the attacker was white.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other being, how does a random guy walk into a school -- get photographed with students -- and then stab people? The Sandy Hook shooter literally shot his way through a locked door to get into that school... and this guy walks in with a sword and is not stopped until after he's stabbed 5 people in several classrooms?

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Since March 9, 1933, the United States has been in a state of declared national emergency.</strong> In fact, there are now in effect four presidentially-proclaimed states of national emergency: In addition to the national emergency declared by President Roosevelt in 1933, there are also the national emergency proclaimed by President Truman on December 16, 1950, during the Korean conflict, and the states of national emergency declared by President Nixon on March 23, 1970, and August 15, 1971.</p>
<p>These proclamations give force to 470 provisions of Federal law. <strong>These hundreds of statutes delegate to the President extraordinary powers,</strong> ordinarily exercised by the Congress, which affect the lives of American citizens in a host of all-encompassing manners. <strong>This vast range of powers, taken together, confer enough authority to rule the country without reference to normal Constitutional processes.</strong></p>
<p>Under the powers delegated by these statutes, the President may:</p>
<p><strong>seize property; organize and control the means of production; seize commodities; assign military forces abroad; institute martial law; seize and control all transportation and communication; regulate the operation of private enterprise; restrict travel; and, in a plethora of particular ways, control the lives of all American citizens.</strong></p>
<p>With the melting of the cold war--the developing detente with the Soviet Union and China, the stable truce of over 20 years duration between North and South Korea, and the end of U.S. involvement in the war in Indochina - <strong>there is no present need for the United States Government to continue to function under emergency conditions.</strong></p>
<p>The Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency was created to examine the consequences of terminating the declared states of national emergency that now prevail; to recommend what steps the Congress should take to ensure that the termination can be accomplished without adverse effect upon the necessary tasks of governing; and, also, to recommend ways in which the United States can meet future emergency situations with speed and effectiveness but without relinquishment of congressional oversight and control.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This report led to the passage of the <strong>National Emergency Act of 1976,</strong> which was ostensibly supposed to reign in the excesses of emergency presidential powers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Act to terminate certain authorities with respect to national emergencies still in effect, and to provide for orderly implementation and termination of future national emergencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 43 years since its passage, <strong>58 national emergencies have been declared, 31 of which have been renewed and continue to be in effect</strong> (as of January, 2019)</p>

<p>That\'s an awful lot of ongoing \'National Emergencies\', many of which might come as a surprise to most Americans.</p>
<p><strong>How does a threat to democraric elections in Zimbabwe or Belarus constitute a \'National Emergency\' in the US?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What does the Congo, Lebanon, the Western Balkans, Yemen, Ukraine, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, or Burundi have to do with a \'National Emergency\' in the US?</strong></p>
<p>These seem like questions that more people should be asking. Your tax dollars, hard at work...</p>',

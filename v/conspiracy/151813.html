            CP is frequently used as a way to shut down people or operations that the PTB does not like. Hacking isn't always used to take data, it can also be used to plant 'evidence' framing the person or organization of downloading or distributing CP. Get in the system, make the dump, report the 'evidence' to an authority, and grin while everything gets shut down. There's no way to prove that you're actually innocent, either, or that it was planted.

            Voat is not a host of images, just text.  The whining about "bans" and all that is really just a bunch of idiots making noise, some of it intentional.  Don't get caught up in it and vote the drama down.

              I understand what's happening here - I also understand that the point of disruption is to disrupt.  Getting caught up in some mythical "free speech" argument over banning /v's is a huge and pointless distraction best left to children over at reddit.  The reason sites like Reddit have value as propaganda organs is that they're huge and therefore influential.  Voat is not that - but it is making it easier to undermine Reddit's influence, which is what the people you're talking about are going after.   This is a case where a level of obscurity is helpful.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's remarkable how little the "censorship 2.0" people care for the fringes - what they believe in and value is the mainstream, "vox-populi" and other mass outlets.  This is their own mistake and no reason to help them understand why it's a mistake.  But it is one, and it demonstrates a failure to understand power and how information actually functions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stay focused.

               I agree with what you are saying 100%

               I can talk on your last point, they do this because they are stupid, they are leveraging a "few smart guys" and then applying that system in real time in a bad way.

               But it works(to a degree)  if most of the society are distracted potatoes.

            A lot of people believe this is how 4chan began it's demise, some people seem to think the FBI used the cp as leverage to get him to cooperate with them. I don't know how much truth is in it but I could see how it could have happened, faced with being prosecuted and having your site shut down or working with feds I'm sure many would chose the easy option.

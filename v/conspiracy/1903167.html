<p>The World According to Irving (2012) - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2082475/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2082475/</a> </p>
<p>(the documentary is in part about Amsterdam Sex Business, Prositutes, Tattoos, Drugs and so on! partly the Book is based on : &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; which is about: &quot;..theirs is a <strong>world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations</strong>.  It is a novel rich with &quot;lunacy and sorrow&quot;; yet the <strong>dark, violent events of the story.. toward sex, marriage and parenthood</strong>, the feminist movement and - above all - the <strong>concept of delineated sexual roles</strong>&quot;  &quot;<strong>Transsexual football players</strong>, ball turret gunners lobotomized in battle, multiple adultery, unicycling bears, mad feminists who <strong>amputate their tongues</strong> in sympathy with the <strong>celebrated victim of a horrifying rape</strong>--Irving made them all people. <strong>Even the bear</strong> is a fitting character. &quot;Garp\'s <strong>wife\'s seduction of a young man</strong> coincidentally occurs at the moment when Garp is delighting <strong>their young sons with a reckless car trick</strong> (one of the few scenes beautifully, eerily, heartbreakingly captured in the film version as well). Many authors would have been content with the harsh comedy of the scene..&quot; - <a href="https://www.amazon.de/World-According-Garp-John-Irving/dp/034536676X">https://www.amazon.de/World-According-Garp-John-Irving/dp/034536676X</a></p>
<p>The very beginning directly disturbed me kind of and reminded me immediately on Mind Control and MKUltra (strange woman with sunglasses talking shit with a very strange voice) but didn\'t paid too much attention to it. Then i decided to take a break having a cigarette and it appears the scene: where Irving is making Pizza and talking very suspicious about this topic. I thougt: Come on really? That\'s really way too coincidentally now. The very next thing coming up: PASTA. Then talking about something like private Cooking for a big audience. Really strange! So here\'s what i did/find next: </p>

<p>REALLY? But it just goes on and on in the article: &quot; <strong>Irving loves to practice</strong>, to <strong>compete and to excel</strong>. He once met Julia <strong>Child</strong>, headmistress in <strong>culinary arts</strong> t<strong>sweet banana</strong> bread <strong>served to hungry loggers</strong> .. &quot;sauce grenobloise, with brown butter and capers, f<strong>or the chicken paillard&quot;</strong> .. &quot; he indisputably claims. &quot;<strong>And the reader who won\'t stay with me – whom I will lose when I become more technical about the craft of cooking</strong> or the craft of writing – well, to me that\'s an impatient reader, which is not my reader ever.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole documentary is kind of odd, weird, obvious, occult that\'s more then clear from my point of view. Later he also states he cant compare how it is to have a kid since he doesnt have some and and and... 
Am I really the first one who brought the name up? You really should give this a shot seems hell of a lot worth to dig deeper!</p>',

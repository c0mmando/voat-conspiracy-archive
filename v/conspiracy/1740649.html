            Going from the rice paddy to an industrialized factory job is a huge step up, if it wasn't they would stay on the rice paddy...We used to have bad smog here too and we cleaned it up. Smog isn't the end game it's a byproduct of the transformation from agrarian to industrial to modern. We need to judge them based on the final product not the halfway point.
           </p>

            Farm work is brutal and always has been, it's hard for us to grasp how tough life used to be for 90+% of humanity. We have an idealized image of the past when there was very little "ideal" about life back then. (I am not referring to the past we know little or nothing about like the great builders age.) Would you have a happier life if you had to work sun up to sun down, 360 odd days a year in all weather and elements? Huddling together with human body heat to stay warm in the winter praying you have enough food stores to last to spring? Praying your wife and/or child doesn't die during birth? Praying for a good harvest so you don't die of starvation? Praying that there is no draught, floods, locusts ect ect ect? That is the reality of the past. I'll take the death from cancer at 65 over the 10,000 other common deaths by age 40.
           </p>
           <p>
            One last thing I'll say on it and I'll let it go. It has been a pretty civil discussion which is often unusual here lol
           </p>
           <p>
            Ignorance is bliss. So if your a tribe in isolation and know nothing else then maybe you are pretty content with life. However, we want our women and children to live through childbirth and if the advancements of modern life also make us more stressed and less happy that is a trade we are more than willing to make. Maybe there will be some post modernism we haven't achieved yet and people will wake up and demand the poisons be taken out of the food and water so our quality of life can go even higher, I can't predict the future. I can look back at the past and I do know I want no part of that.

            My whole point is to focus on the past 300-500 years and take an honest assessment. When the day comes that we can derive stone cold facts from the amazing things like tribes with miraculous health and harder-than-granite rock seemingly melted together to form a structure thousands of years ago we can add that to our pool of knowledge. I am precisely pointing out our limitations. We cannot possibly know how the pyramids were built because they found a very old bit of graffiti that serves as a "date".
           </p>
           <p>
            What we know is life for the vast majority of humans is so amazingly better than it was 500 years ago to sit around and bemoan how bad it is because a rare tribe never gets tooth decay is absurd. We have MUCH to learn and MUCH can be improved but lets not act like this is the dark ages because our food causes cancer in us by age 65. We should work to make things better and I hope we do...if only we could get people as addicted to self education as they are to netflix.

            We definitely have it better than at any time in
            <em>
             known
            </em>
            history. The pyramids of giza, the sphinx enclosure, pumapunku, tiwanaku, pyramid of cholula, stonehenge, gobekli tepe ect ect are all unknowns. The
            <em>
             when, how
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             why
            </em>
            are still unknown and anyone who tells you otherwise is blowing smoke out their ass. Theories range from slaves to farmers to antlantis to aliens. They don't prove times were better or people were more or less happy comparably. They just prove something amazing was created that cannot be recreated to this day.
           </p>
           <p>
            300-500 years ago is what I consider the standard by which we can reasonably compare our standard of living. Isolated tribes are interesting and provide good study but they are the exception not the rule for the human condition. If you are interested in delving into the evidence of the pyramids and the like I highly recommend Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock...an amazing read.

            Famine, drought, disease, indoor plumbing, infant mortality, average life span, transportation, medical care (the real parts of it), climate control and if you do life long enough you go blind from cataracts! Yeah no thanks. The globalist corruption of so many aspects of our world is infuriating but the apple is still not completely rotten. Much of our world and science are still intact. There are many good men and women among us fighting to save it. For the moment we are very well off relative to ANY other time period in known history even with all our many flaws. You simply cannot overlook drought and famine like it's an afterthought. Kings don't starve from famine, they are put to the sword.

            Diet is just not enough for good oral health, period. You have to brush regularly or pieces of food rot between teeth. It's not that hard to understand. And it's not just supermarket, quality of life and average length of years had increased dramatically. It boils down to this, you can look at all the bad things in our modern era and have a longing for a past when times were different. It's a very common human emotion to have an idealized image of the past. The reality is far different and life 300 years ago was very brutal and very unforgiving. Infant mortality, life span, medical care, famine, draught...you could go on forever. We are a tough species and we survive but I would not trade the life of a poor black kid in a chicago ghetto in 2017 for a king from an era where blood letting was a favored medical treatment.

            LOL ok, dentistry wasn't even needed. Poor nutrition may cause wear and tear problems but chips, cracks and wisdom teeth coming in wrong have nothing to do with nutrition. The best diet in the world cannot stop teeth problems. You know damn well they didn't have the brushing habits we do today to combine with their good nutrition for oral health. By the time they were 40 half their teeth were rotted away, if they made it to 40.

            A modern supermarket has 1000s more choices than any king had 300 years ago. They may not all be healthy choices but it never ceases to amazing me how  much we take our lives for granted. We have more options and choices available to us than kings of old ever did, it's not even close.

            Anyone who claims money can't buy happiness has never had any. Material abundance is what makes life good. I'd rather be miserable in my air conditioned house with a full belly, a good beer and plenty of entertainment than - oh wait, that's right I'm not miserable and I appreciate that my ancestors were smart enough to choose capitalism, freedom and liberty over bullshit lies.

            Better can be summed up in one word - dentistry. Also - supermarket and - automobile...all things even the poorest of the poor have access to in the western world. I'm not saying things cannot be improved...more freedom and liberty would undoubtedly result in even more consumer choices and wealth generation for everyone.

            LEDs last more than a decade with daily use and use less electricity than traditional lightbulbs, making them even better than a lightbulb that would use more electricity, but could last 100 years. The issue is most people don't know much about the quality of what they purchase, instead buying whatever is cheap and convenient.

            Yes, but that ignores what was actually stated.
           </p>
           <p>
            A larger filament means more IR emissions. More IR emissions means less efficiency into the visible light spectrum. Which means it's spending more energy creating heat than light.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have a bulb last 4x longer but costs 8x as much to use, plus extra A/C costs, is it really cheaper? Add to this the many complaints about the produced visible spectrum and you'll find few consider it anything close to a viable alternative. If you think I'm exaggerating here, go look at the reviews and comments on light bulbs in general, and especially those of LED lights. The warmth of the light is frequently a central constraint.
           </p>
           <p>
            The simple fact is, the alternative are light bulbs which the vast majority consider to be completely unsatisfactory alternatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does this mean bulbs can't be made to last longer? Of course they can. Planned obsolescence is a thing. But we're talking about something in the order of five or ten years and not fifty or one hundred years.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this ignores the fact that the vast majority of premature light bulb death originates from poor quality electricity, house wiring, and simply turning it off/on; to which a larger filament becomes more resistant. So if you're looking for longer life, you're always looking at compromises. Generally speaking, the market has long since made those compromises.

            Plus, there's something oddly satisfying about replacing a bulb. It's similar to starting a fire. Sometimes I take the bulbs out of my lamps and switch them around just for fun.

            Yes. It also changes the visible light spectrum as well as the intensity (lumens). They can make bulbs which last 100 years but they would be shitty bulbs by every metric to which humans consider quality of interior lighting.

            LED bulbs have the same issue, they can be made with crappy parts in a way that causes them to die. There should be a class action lawsuit over their "2 billion year lifetime" claims.

            The problem is that the filament has to glow. You could get the same wattage with a thicker wire, but the length of the wire would increase. Think of it this way, a 120W bulb uses 1A of current, that means you would need 120ohm of resistance. if you look at a chart for nichrome, a 40AWG wire would take 2ft to do this, and most likely it wouldn't even glow red. Compare this to something thinner, it would require less length and the power would be released over a shorter distance. Another way to think about it is to look at a metal coil heater. Those are typically 1500W, but don't light up anything (other than a faint glow) because the wires are thick.
           </p>
           <p>
            The moral is: the conducting part of the filament must be thin, but there are probably good ways to keep a thin wire from breaking that are ignored to keep profits high.

            In fact make better bulbs by choosing thicker gauge tungsten filament and filling the bulb with argon gas. The patents on light bulbs are public domain now. Fuck the cartels.

            Most other light bulbs like that one have already gone out iirc so this one is just a really neat anomaly. That said, there totally is tech to make lightbulb like this on mass scale but then no one would be buying light bulbs every year or 2 like everyone has to now

            Long lasting light bulbs are more expensive to run.  A thicker filament would take more power to produce the same amount of light, and would have a longer lifetime cost than an equal number of more disposable bulbs.

            said. It started with ovens and refrigerators in the 50's; the best manufacturers were running out of business because people would buy their product once and never need another one again.
Most of the fridges and freezers from the 50's had ammonia as their cooling source and that shit lasts FOREVER! So then they switched to R-22(*) Which had environmental consequences.
Then after that the manufactuerer switched to overall cheaper materials and now we are where we are now.
Cheap materials, mostly seal issues and electronics. It's all bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            (* I'm sorry if this number may be wrong I can't remember which one of the "r's" it is)

            First, they made the lightbulb disposable for economic pressures. Then, they made it "green" for environmental pressures. Why does environmentalism always involve buying new shit? Capitalism.

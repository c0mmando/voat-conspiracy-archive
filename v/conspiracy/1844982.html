            It is certainly an awkward moment he creates with that character, however it was something he was intentionally trying to do. He wanted to cross certain taboos in comedy at that time and the Goatboy character was meant to do just that. As for it being a message, who knows??? Hicks was smart and he prob knew of something in the elite circles. After all it was around that time Kubrick put out Eyes Wide Shut and the Franklin Scandal occurred so perhaps there is more to what Hicks was trying to do???  I myself am a big fan of his work and wish we could have his perspective of the world today. Take care and be easy.

             No the Franklin scandal and eyes wide shut were late nineties bill was dead by then.

             I doubt he had first hand experience of Hollyweird but he was an avid consumer of psilocybin and it's been my experience that psychedelics can make one sensitive to creative ideas necessary to explain perplexing situations, and sometimes these ideas aren't far from the truth

              Eye wide shut was in fact 1999 my mistake but the Franklin scandal took place between 1988 and 1991. As for Bill being directly privy to such shit, he may not have been initiated nor do I believe that but I sincerely believe he knew of the occult activity all around us. Especially in elite circles in Hollyweird as you put it so well. We will never know though as he left us to soon to become Alex Jones! lol just kidding! Take care and be easy.

            Yes I do believe he would have been expose to hollyweird .. and this very possibly could have been a message.

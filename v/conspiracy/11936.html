           <p>
            About the same time you made up the version of reality in which that actually happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could simply turn the question around and ask the same of you: why are you not asking the tough questions about the truth movement? Why do you decide to just parrot the
            <em>
             un
            </em>
            official narrative?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have considered both sides and decided which one makes more sense to me. Just like you have. Give me the same respect you demand I give you.
           </p>

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Again, I can simply state the same about you and everyone in the truth movement. You don't actually explain
            <em>
             how
            </em>
            you come up with this conclusion, or present any reason to agree with you other than confirmation bias. You're just stating these things in the place you know people will agree with you no matter what.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Just an observation that's been bugging me for a while.

           <p>
            Curiously, you don't seem eager to "ask the tough questions" and consider that maybe you and this movement are the actual problem. You just decide that "they're all wrong" and bad skeptics, while you (despite showing the opposite) are the true character of a critical thinker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, to confirm my hypothesis, I have no doubt you and others will continue accusing me of being a "debunker" and a bad skeptic, because why would you stop and truly consider anything I say, and question your own methods and motives, when you can just parrot what you think you know and dismiss me out of hand?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your post essentially boils down to asking this subverse "they're wrong and we're right, right? Right."... and if that isn't an echo chamber, I don't know what is.

             Observation is how we reach conclusions about the world around us.  As others have correctly pointed out, skepticism goes both directions.  Now, maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but from
             <em>
              my
             </em>
             observations, the skeptic community, in popular media, doesn't seem to hold many controversial views, and to the skeptic in me, that raises some red flags.  Am I wrong or am I right in my observations?  It's probably a little of both.  I'm obviously painting with broad strokes here, so if you don't fit in my definition, please don't take offense, this wasn't about you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every criticism of my post you raised is certainly correct to some extent.  Likewise all those same criticisms can be applied back to the skeptic community.
            </p>
            <p>
             So my challenge to you is to consider the possibility that what I'm saying has some truth to it, and I will do the same for your statement.  Fair enough?

            Additionally, there seems to be a tendency toward only being skeptical of specific ideas, like all conspiracy related topics. If you look to many of the main skeptic outlets, they seem to conveniently forget to be skeptical of things such as claims of the Bush/Obama administration, or claims made by corporations that have been proven liars in the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said, I was a skeptic early on in the "skeptic movement," and still am to this day. I just try to apply the skepticism outside of the box of ideas the movement has been concentrating on for the last decade or so. Even though I believe Michael Shermer (popular skeptic talking head) is corrupted somehow, I still recommend his book "Why people Believe Weird things," and the writings of Sam Harris.

            You can be skeptical in either direction, and critical thinking must be applied to all whom suggest an explanation, not just those in positions of authority.

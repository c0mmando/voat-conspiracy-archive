            Occams razor: the globalists thought that if they brought in a bunch of immigrants, that they would deflate the labor market, inflate the real estate market, and get rich.

            It was a stupid, disconnected last minute effort to fix a dead economy. The problem was that they rapefugees are from shitholes that they made. They are incapable of existing in a western society. So instead of fixing the mess they just made it worse.

            I've been privately thinking this myself as well. Like let's push and push and push and see how far we can go, how much they will take. And then if it swings the other way, we just implement another dictatorship. Win win for the globalists.

            If that is the case, then they are doing a damn good job at it. I am mostly independent, but lean towards the left on a lot of issues... As of the last 6 months though, I am starting to find myself agreeing more with the right.

            No. It's social marxism. And I'm not using that term as some sort of clever label. It is literal, institutionalized,
            <em>
             strategic
            </em>
            marxist cultural subversion. Cultural marxism is a tactic to achieve authoritarian socialist rule not through violent revolution, but through gradual brainwashing of the enemy population. It is real and it has been happening to us. We
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qkf3bajd4">
             know
            </a>
            this is happening to us. But nobody wants to talk about it. Solving that problem means a huge sacrifice. We are only in the toddler phase of the authoritarian-libertarian war. The wars of the 20th century were infancy. Impulsive, reckless. This ultimate showdown is only getting deeper, smarter, and truly scarier.

               According to Titor the 'Rural' team wins in the end, kind of a no brainer which is one of the reasons I always put it in the 'hoax" category (it's not out of there.....yet haha).

            The SJW movement is a side effect. You may notice SJWs don't like free speech, want increased government and are indifferent to privacy concerns. Basically they aren't a real threat to the establishment just the middle-class. They are the establishment left diverting attention to issues that won't effect the establishment like bathrooms and media representation, non issues. They are the tea party of the left after it was taken over.
           </p>
           <p>
            The right too does the same thing. Donald Trump isn't against domestic spying. He's better than most but still more pro establishment than not. One thing that makes me curious about him is his stance on NATO.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other part is people are sick of politically correctness. Austria is on the verge of electing a far right president, Europe is reacting by shifting right. So it's more if they can't stop this shift how do they manage it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything you see platformed on mainstream media is at least in some way part of the management of public opinion.

            The way I see it, they don't want right wing governments, they want more people dependent on government. That's why you see shit like feminism and SJW bullshit being pushed. Why gay is awesome and every fucking aspect of society has to have gay men in it, and why trans is so popular right now. None of these people could survive without the current government. I'm not even talking literally, where they would be butchered were they not in the west. I'm also talking about funding their mere existence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simply put, the government wants to create a society where the entire society is dependent on the government. That way they can ensure they exist forever and revolution is out of the question. That's why women aren't being shamed for being single moms and a drain on the community and society. That's why feminists keep getting their pay checks even though they have yet to contribute anything to society. That's why diversity quota's are a thing, and why companies need to make it happen to get a government contract. It's all bullshit politics.
           </p>
           <p>
            The SJW's are just the newest useful idiots in the grand scheme of things.

             Whites are an enemy to this agenda because whites are freedom loving. Browns will accept much less. Traditional family values are an enemy to this because it promotes self sufficiency. Degeneracy is promoted because it is dependent. Intelligence and fact is being vilified because it breeds independence, stupidity is being championed because it is dependent.

            I think it's possible that the SJW movement has been betrayed by their leaders.  They have overplayed their hand, for example, in immigration in Europe, taking us from a situation that was analogous to boiling a frog, to a situation where there is some meaningful reaction.

            There is a radicalization happening on the left and the right, that may lead to the big Happening.

            has been a strategy used for many centuries, but this is how it's commonly known, because that dude was the first to really write it out. And I think you might be misinterpreting the SJW movement. Your position seems to be that it's a means to its own end. But that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I think it's more likely that it's a means of whittling away cultural resistance to the invasion. If it was an attempt to implement totalitarianism, It seems to be that the movement would be more coherent. As of right now, the primary mouthpiece of the SJW tribes consists of Black Lives Matter, who are really Black Supremacists; with Tumblrettes and trilby-neckbeards pushing the same agenda, and willingly taking abuse from BLM for the crime of agreeing with them and being white.

             Pretty sure it's part of cultural subversion. It's ludicrous by purpose, designed to dismantle our collective common sense. After watching

             This guy contributed to the thread and gets downvoated. The cunt who did it probably won't contribute at all.

             Whether I agree with you or not,  upvoat for you.

             Edit: Well this is embarrassing.  I'm trying to upvoat but it's acting all fucky.

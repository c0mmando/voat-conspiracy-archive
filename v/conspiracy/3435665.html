            Ice is meant to melt. They want the land and history buried underneath. Problem is, the side-effects of the materials sprayed are terrible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wonder where all that melted ice water goes because it is not raising sea levels. I suppose it could be guided into lakes and estuary, or used to re-green desert land, but that would be a massive feat in engineering.

            Maybe our "pipelines" should be used for water transportation instead of oil.

            chemtrails arent even a conspiracy. people who believe in that shit are no less retarded than those that believe in a flat earth.

            Chemtrails aren't about global warming, dumbing us down, etc.  What they do is allow weather manipulation but as they need to be everywhere to work and it doesn't last forever they have to constantly put that shit in the air to maintain the ability to use it whenever they want.  Seriously just look at the public radar feeds and you can see them blasting the air to change the weather.  They're doing it slowly now like giving my home state around 1/4 of it's annual rainfall to cause a drought and then using that water to create storms in other parts of the world to push their muh global warming is effecting weather narrative.  When they want though they could easily hammer us and it's that absolute control over the weather with worldwide implications that has them spraying that shit constantly.  It's like a Samson Option but without nukes and a damn near impossibility of being able to accurately point a finger at anyone because it's the weather and not something clearly man made.

            Because their old narratives are becoming less effective, they have no choice but to reframe their busted narratives. In the end, they will continue to do what they always do... truth... lies don't matter as long as the deplorables don't unite and become a problem.

            They're clearly doing it in an attempt to heat the atmosphere to they can say "look, see! the temps really are heating up rapidly!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone knows that cloud cover, especially in winter time, means the sun's heat is trapped under it. It's like an atmospheric blanket. I was taught that in grade school science class.

             "A Climate Engineering Introduction To Media And The Uninformed"
            </p>
            <p>
             The most critical step in regard to helping in the fight to expose and halt climate engineering ( and thus helping in the fight for the greater good) is making the decision to get involved with the cause at hand. There is only one way forward in this battle, we MUST reach a critical mass of awareness, this effort will take all of us. The human race faces countless challenges, so one must prioritize. One must decide what the most critical priority battle is. Global geoengineering/weather warfare/biological warfare programs are the greatest and most immediate threat currently faced by the human race short of nuclear cataclysm (a threat that climate engineering is also exacerbating by making Earth more vulnerable to solar flares, electric grid shutdown, and thus nuclear meltdown). The ongoing weather warfare assault is completely derailing the planet's climate systems, completely contaminating our air (all precipitation), our soils and waters. Geoengineering is also shredding the ozone layer. No ozone layer, no terrestrial life on Earth. From countless directions climate engineering is pushing the human race and all life on Earth toward mathematically certain near term total extinction. The greatest single leap we could take toward changing our current course of biosphere implosion is to expose and halt the geoengineering insanity.

             It is important to be able to field at least some basic questions about this most dire issue if you are to gain credibility with others. People (of any political stripe) do not want to be test subjects in an ongoing lethal experiment. Most are at least partially aware that the weather is now very different from what it was historically speaking. Many are aware that chronic respiratory diseases and countless other related diseases are going off the charts. There is a general awareness that weather modification (at least in some form) is real.  A conversation can often be initiated by simply asking someone if they have noticed the weather is unusual or changing? Are they aware of the fact that there are massive global weather modification programs that are not being reported by media? The geoengineering or climate engineering terms are important in any conversation on this issue. If a person googles "geoengineering" or "climate engineering", they will find volumes of science articles and reporting. If only the word "chemtrails" is used, disinformation and debunking sites and definitions will be the first thing they come to. Again, know the basics. Geoengineering is shredding the ozone layer, altering the weather patterns, polluting our air, waters and soils.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also very important to have some idea of who you are speaking with and what aspect of the geoengineering issue they will be most interested in and affected by. Going too far into the "rabbit hole" is almost always counterproductive, stick to the basic straightforward facts. DON'T discredit the subject at hand by wandering into other issues that are not science based and that do not belong in this discussion.

             This is not expensive or difficult. There are a number of tools that can and should be used for this purpose. Multiple informational power point presentations are available on the home page of GeoengineerignWatch.org. "Geoengineering Earth, Exposing The Global Climate Modification Assault" is one example. Video presentations from geoengineeringwatch.org can be freely burned to DVD's and distributed, so long as they are given away and not sold. The data on our site is for one purpose, to raise public awareness of the critical climate engineering issue. When passing on a DVD, it is much more effective to include an information flyer with it. For only 10 to 20 cents a copy, more or less, very important and compelling data can be passed on. Such a flyer will make it much more likely the DVD will actually get viewed. Flyer examples can be found and downloaded for free at  “geoengineeringwatch.org/ads“ (or can be purchased from the home page of Geoengineering Watch for our approximate cost of large scale printing and shipping.

             Sharing critical verifiable facts, coupled with shocking and compelling photo images, is the most effective method of awakening others to dire and unpleasant (but essential to face) realities. GeoengineeringWatch.org has just assembled a very comprehensive 20 page full color 6 x 9 booklet that contains the most hard hitting and undeniable climate engineering facts and photos available. This critical awareness raising tool is printed on full glossy 100lb heavy paper to make it more durable. Geoengineering Watch has made the decision to offer the new informational booklets to the public for the approximate cost of printing, handling, and shipping. Because we will have a substantial quantity printed, the cost will be exponentially lower than individuals printing their own.

             If people are made uncomfortable, they will only tune out all that you are saying and focus their attention on how to end the conversation. Again, more often than not, lengthy conversations are not productive. As stated above, it only leads to uncomfortable situations for all concerned. A simple (and short) mention of the issue and its major consequences, and the passing on of a flyer with a DVD, can often be the most effective approach. It's also helpful to mention that the government is not disclosing these programs and mainstream media is not covering the story. If people who are being introduced remain comfortable, they are most likely to examine the information being passed on when they have time in their own home or office.

             There are countless groups, organizations, and individuals that would care if they had any clue about the geoengineering programs. Environmental groups, Alzheimer's, autism, ADD, agriculture groups, journalists, etc. Locate such groups and send them a "heads up" email with some credible data attachments. Also, a link or two where they can learn more on the most dire issue of geoengineering. On the home page of geoengineeringwatch.org site is the "flaming arrow link". This suggested email package is already set to go, just find appropriate people and groups to send it to.

             In a personal encounter, if someone is not receptive, or even argumentative, try to keep your composure. Confrontations only cause people to put up their defenses and they won't hear a word you say. We are planting seeds of awareness, if done properly, the seeds will sprout. As the climate system continues to unravel (with climate engineering helping to fuel the fire), people will soon enough have no choice but to wake up.

             If  we all pull together, we can and will soon reach "critical mass" in the effort to expose the on going global geoengineering programs. The decimation being caused to the planet, us, and all life on Earth is immense, it's up to all of us to

            By global warming's own logic, putting particles in the atmosphere will increase the greenhouse effect. Even if they are shiny reflective particles, the Sun's short wave radiation that passes through them will be trapped as it bounces of the Earth as long wave radiation.

            They are liars. They are dropping particulate matter out of planes to kill us with slow death, and it only takes the swapping out of some cannisters to make it quick death.

            It was too easy to go off grid and get your own non-fluoridated water supply. Harder to avoid breathing in an aluminum filled atmosphere. Chemtrails are a necessary aspect of keeping people, who are willing to work hard to remain healthy, sick.

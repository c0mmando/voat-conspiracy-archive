The other accused shares the same last name of a former business partner of Leonid's and is a politician there. It could be the father of one of the accused or and uncle.

            You can look through the pics Leonid posts and you'll find some of a woman at a party. Google the image, it's from a UNICIF ball. Might be his wife and the mom of the kid he posts pics of.

            It's very easy to blame this on the parents. And rightfully so. But perhaps there is more to the story. The Russian Mafia? The Drug? People who scout out places find suitable marks and then exploit.

            Like the smiley face gang. Who leave their victims in water, perhaps something larger is occurring?

              This type of criminal Network for example could be called upon to do other things like murder Sheryl sandberg's husband.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's not like we're talking about a complex Network all they would need to have it a couple guys who in turn what happened bunch of bartenders on the payroll is that simple.

               Yes. Many of these networks have say 20 people around the top in any city, using hundreds of useful idiots and local/state/federal laws to their advantage.

              You know Maurice , I was sleeping on this last night. it wouldn't surprise me if there were people scouting girls young girls in their 20s in these Resort like settings. Just like the :-) murders that Target 20-something boys generally gay and stalk them do whatever and then kill and dump their bodies in the water across the globe,  maybe there's a :-) gang that does this to 20 something year old girls.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the serial killer book by Dave McGowan he came to the conclusion that many of the serial killers were just patsies. It's too much to go into now but suffice to say they could link a serial killer with 10-13, 20 bodies case solved. McGowan's conclusion is that many of these bodies we're prostitutes or slaves, victims of sex trafficking that were killed ritualistically by sexual criminals in the elite.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you heard of the :-) murders?

               Look to any and all spring  break destinations. Just here in the USA alone. Massive amounts of girls go missing every year at spring break in places like Florida. Many times 14-20ish. Never to be seen again.
              </p>
              <p>
               Consider the serial killer take on this. Considering the fame of "Jack the Ripper". It is very plausible.
              </p>
              <p>
               The networks likely have the top guy, who is into running drugs/guns/humans, using networks of not only gangs, but useful idiot citizens, buyers of the products, every day people, bartenders, officers, hotel workers, restaurant, etc.

                Cops have always had issues tracking and infiltrating the top levels of many gangs. The higher up one goes, the lines between illegal activity and politics blur. The lines between gang members and government employees blur. This goes into levels of gangstalking, to control members and potential victims.

            I was naive but I wasn’t negligent, says Fiona MacKeown
           </p>
           <p>
            It's easy to forget that Fiona MacKeown is a grieving mother: since her 15-year-old daughter Scarlett was found dead on a Goan beach last month she has been as much on trial as the men who drugged, raped and murdered the girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            MacKeown's hippie lifestyle and her decision to leave Scarlett in Goa while the rest of the family - a boyfriend and a brood of children who
            <strong>
             live on benefits
            </strong>
            - toured the beaches of southern India, has resulted in her being accused of selfishness and fatal neglect. Her image was damaged further last week when it was revealed that as a teenager she had served a year in jail for the attempted manslaughter of a man who tried to sexually assault her friend.

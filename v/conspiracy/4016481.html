             Aaron Dover, is that you?
            </p>
            <p>
             Good point, well - the jumpers seem to be evidence that at least some floors were there.  I'm not from NY area so people who lived/worked in Manhattan at the time may know better than me but seems like if the Twin Towers were basically hollow empty buildings with only a few levels that would have been a relatively popular 'secret'.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, again to your point perhaps there really is no empirical evidence of 'floors' inside.  Yet we know the outer structure of the building was sound.  And yet 90% of it all turns into dust in midair.  So regardless, it does not seem to detract from the point that DE was used to destabilize the molecular structure of said structure and therein lies the big secret that we aren't supposed to know about.

             <p>
              Excerpt from a review of the first three chapters of her book:
             </p>
             <p>
              The “Jumpers”
             </p>
             <p>
              ‘It Was Like Raining People’
             </p>
             <p>
              On page 25 she does what all propagandists do, and digs back into our emotions,
             </p>
             <p>
              “Among the most horrific images from 9/11 is that of “The Falling Man…”
             </p>
             <p>
              and provides this is an iconic photo from Richard Drew:
             </p>
             <p>
              However this image appears to have been tampered with, as can be seen in the pixels around the image of the man.  His image was apparently inserted on top of the background image of the towers.
             </p>
             <p>
              The same goes for the next image, listed under the “A.  Energized Launch” section.  She refers to the “fellow in the orange shirt,” who was actually a shirtless fellow.  What I see is a guy reclining on a park bench, pointing at something in the distance.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is not only a transparently fraudulent image; it is also used as part of the ongoing indoctrination efforts.  The image below is from the WTC museum.  The claim is these wall columns were the same ones from the impact hole,
             </p>
             <p>
              This is obviously not true; it is clearly not the same panel, as anyone can see who compares the images:
             </p>
             <p>
              So in just one photo we have evidence of tampering, as well as evidence of official collusion, with the tampered image being used as the basis for a museum exhibit, which is designed to indoctrinate school children (and the unwary adult), into believing impossible things.
             </p>
             <p>
              On page 26 Dr. Wood then channels the fellow’s thoughts, writing,
             </p>
             <p>
              “He did not expect to be here.”
             </p>
             <p>
              This is an odd comment coming from a forensic scientist, but not so odd coming from an official propagandist.   She then asks,
             </p>
             <p>
              “Where did he come from and why is he here?”
             </p>
             <p>
              For Dr. Wood to not even question the veracity of an obviously fraudulent photo would make me question her sincerity, if I didn’t already do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              She continues to write about the shirtless fellow, again referring to him as wearing an orange shirt, and then speculates,
             </p>
             <p>
              “Someone choosing to jump to their death would likely choose to carry something special with them, perhaps a photo of their loved ones, or even a briefcase or backpack.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly?  I’m pretty sure if I was in a panic and choosing to jump to my death I wouldn’t stop to grab my briefcase.  All good propaganda targets emotion and she just reeks of the stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              She carries on, wanting the reader to be amazed by the distance from the towers some of the jumpers traveled.  I am pretty sure she did this because anyone who paused to think about it would know that such distances would be impossible, and to have photos of impossible things is only proof of fraudulent photos.  She is directing the attention of the reader away from the most logical conclusion, that the images were tampered with. Instead she points them at a conclusion that only benefits the media that provided the images.
             </p>
             <p>
              The role of the media must be protected, because if people lose faith in their favored media all bets are off.  Before you know it they’ll start thinking for themselves.

               That's a good analysis.   I too, question why an empirical evidence driven scientist would fixate on the emotions of a person in a potentially tampered photo.   Yet same as your 'no floors' argument (which you didn't address my response to) - it doesn't change the most glaring fact that these buildings turned into dust in mid-air.    What is your counter to that?  Even if there were no jumpers, which I find hard to believe because there seems to be good selection of photographic &amp; video evidence of them - much harder to fake than the few sketchy videos of planes - that doesn't change the fact these buildings turned into dust in midair.
              </p>
              <p>
               No floors, no jumpers - I don't fucking care man.   Even if Dr Judy is a quak that still doesn't change the fact that the buildings turned into dust in midair.
              </p>
              <p>
               Though I tend to give her the benefit of the doubt for fixating on this potentially fraudulent photo as perhaps it was nothing more than oversight or perhaps an over-zealous editor who felt the need for more emotional content to fill up the book.  Her reasoning and other presentations/analysis of the dustification, toasted cars, seismic activity, and so forth is sound.   You say she is
               <em>
                directing
               </em>
               attention away from the potential conclusion of tampered photos without acknowledging the concluding point of the entirety of her research - that
               <strong>
                directed
               </strong>
               energy weaponry / static field electromagnetic frequency technology was used to destabilize the molecular structure of the elements in the towers resulting in collapse and mid-air dustification.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry,  but it seems like you are the one here who is directing attention of the reader away from the most important conclusion while smearing the very investigator who proves it.

               Aaron was a 'hollow tower' proponent; perhaps a result of following your work (I can't say for sure).    Aaron also believed that the power grid electrical infrastructure of every nation on the planet was powered by lightning and static electric buildups gathered not at power plants but in the millions of power lines themselves hanging from every street corner; and that the power grid was essentially a relay &amp; routing system for power gathered in these lines (or from lighting strikes).   His analysis was quite fascinating.

               He had a bunch of other research too.  But it was all memory holed when his YouTube channel was shutdown.  And he vanished - apparently he committed suicide but the details are very light so it's anyones guess.

               Thanks for the link Steve, I will take a look at your presentation "WTC dismantled and hollow vs mini-nukes" looks promising but a tad long so will try to get to it in my spare time.

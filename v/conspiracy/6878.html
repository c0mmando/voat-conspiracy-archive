            War is horrible.  And even one person dead to make another person richer or more powerful is despicable.
           </p>
           <p>
            But propaganda is propaganda, and facts are facts.

            And we the people paid for a Holocaust Museum next to the National Mall in Dick City---and we continue to fund it with over $47 million dollars a year!---to espouse this lie.

             That's because the number is accurate at least 5.65mil Jews were killed in the Holocaust.  They were not only victims, some 10 million slavs died but that number is accurate. Not all of the Jewish dead were in extermination camps but they died from persecution nonetheless.

              Did you watch the video?  Think about this:
             </p>
             <p>
              Pre-WWII:  "6 million are dying, 6 million are dying, send us money cuz 6 million are dying!"
             </p>
             <p>
              Post WWII:  "So how many died?"  "6 million."  "Are you sure?"  "Yes, and if you ask me again, you go to jail."
             </p>
             <p>
              Are you sure you're good with that?
             </p>
             <p>
              I used to believe what I had been taught in school (and by tv) until one day about seven years ago I saw that
              <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=auschwitz+plaque&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=qMz&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;channel=sb&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S4GgU7LiJtSuyAS4-4LABg&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=789#imgdii=_">
               the plaque at Auschwitz
              </a>
              had been drastically changed, from 4 million, down to "one and a half million...mainly jews."  And I got to thinking about the number.  I did the math---you can too, anyone can, we have calculators right here on our computers---and found out it was ridiculous.  We're expected to believe (and we do accept it, unless we investigate) that from the time of the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942 (the alleged date of the order to "exterminate jews") until Auschwitz was liberated by Russia on January 27, 1945, that Germans killed an average of 5440 jews, every day.
             </p>
             <p>
              That means we're supposed to believe that every single day, without fail, on average, 5,440 jews were killed---that's 227 killed each and every hour, 24 hours each and every day, non-stop, day after day, for over three years---mainly from gas chambers, from the day after the Wannsee Conference to the day of the liberation of Auschwitz. And we're supposed to believe that the efficient Germans felt it was more important to buy many tons of Zyklon-B (with no receipt) to gas them with, then bought many, many tons of coke (with no receipt) to incinerate the bodies. And just how many Germans were pulled off the front lines to kill 6,000,000 jews and dispose of all the evidence...6,000,000 people they could've been using in the work-camps to help their war effort? And this all supposedly occurred while Germany was fighting a war on two fronts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why bring 6,000,000 people into a camp by trains to spend even more money to gas them, incinerate them, and dispose of them when they could've easily put a single bullet to the base of the skull back in the Warsaw ghetto?
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if "the holocaust" lasted for 5 years, the numbers still don't work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't mistake what I am saying.  I have no affinity for Hitler, I am not a skin-head nor a neo-nazi, nor a supremacist of any type.  I despise all sorts of superiority, whether it's kkk, aryan nations, muslim brotherhood, zionism, new black panthers, whatever.  Thinking that any one race is better than any other race is bee ess.  This has nothing to do with hating anyone.  It has to do with hating a lie.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I'm not saying that no jews were killed.  There may have been camps set up specifically to kill jews and others.  But I'm pretty sure the primary killer in Auschwitz was not Zyklon-B showers, but typhus.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Germans were expedient and efficient, and they documented everything, including the number of bullets expended in the camps.  And though there is no documentation of extravagant purchases of Zyklon-B for "gas chambers" nor coke for cremation, there is significant documentation for the typhus outbreak.  Typhus had been brought in from the ghetto denizens, and due to the lack of medicine, the sanitation problems created when you house that many people, and the bombing of Germany's infrastructure, they had a difficult time getting a handle on it.  At one point, there were 30,000 dead in one month due to this horrific disease.  Typhus causes vomiting, diarrhea, and body temps up to 108F.  People boil to death in their skin over a period of weeks.  It is a slow and terrifying way to die.  In an effort to halt the spread of this escalating horror, new inmates were shaved, and their clothes were deloused with Zyklon-B.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the 6,000,000, it has been very well documented that the "6,000,000" figure was used for money-making "humanitarian efforts" well before WWII.  In "The First Holocaust" by Don Heddesheimer, he has photocopied many such newspaper articles claiming that "6,000,000 jews" were in danger of various horrors, and that money needed to be raised to save them, dating back to 40 years before the war.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the Zyklon-B "gas chambers", I urge you to read
              <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/16-tlr.pdf">
               the Leuchter Report
              </a>
              , as well as
              <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/02-trr.pdf">
               the Rudolf Report
              </a>
              on the science.  Also, back in the 80s,
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQjNs-Ght8s">
               a young jewish man named David Cole went to Auschwitz with some questions, and he made a video
              </a>
              , available for viewing on Youtube.  You should check it out, and see what he discovered.
             </p>
             <p>
              Or don't.  You're free to believe whatever you want, as am I.  You can ignore any and all facts in order to make the story fit what you've been told.
             </p>

The setting is not like his other vidoes (B&amp;W) and has odd camera zooms / pans / etc
Specifically at 0:36 (spells out CIA) 1:33 (zooms in on skulls in back ground vase thing) 5:29 (zoom in on skulls again, no apparent reason - he is talking about &quot;look at the words&quot;) 5:49 (zoom in on his eyes blinking... Mouth is not moving but he is still talking...) 7:49 (cia again)
There were other people who noticed this and put some things in the comments.
Suggest that the swan behind him signals a &quot;black swan&quot; event (surprise) and that the cheetah is a &quot;red herring&quot; (decoy)</p>
<p>From following his other videos, this is just SO different, the imagery is there for a reason.
He\'s been a top guy in the intel field so anything he does is done with purpose.</p>
<p>There is another video done in the same way but not as many weird things...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVtft8BY7O4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVtft8BY7O4</a></p>
<p>Comments confirm that I\'m not crazy thinking something is just &quot;off&quot; with this.
At 0:33 - CIA is spelled out again 0:35 - There are Russian &quot;nesting dolls&quot; behind him - usually given as a gift Around 1:57 - Zoom in on figure and it seems to &quot;glitch&quot; or &quot;morph&quot;... Weird 4:55 - zooms in on what looks to be an oriental ship when talking about aircraft carriers...
6:19 - zooms in on nesting dolls.</p>

            Hey, I appreciate your insight on the matter. I'm not full force saying that this is what happened, it was just the one thing that popped out at me when I first watched the video. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but maybe not. Who knows, honestly. With everything that has gone on in the country, and with our government, police, etc, I wouldn't even be surprised that this was a false flag of some sort to either push for more DHS budget, or to test martial law and the pretty new toys the police have. Just the shear fact that there was a training exercise with this **exact ** same scenario planned by DHS that they admitted to, and the presence of a bomb squad, Craft International, and then the announcement of a drill just before this occurred, all seem like oddities on what would otherwise be considered an open and shut case. I truly believe that as long as we all continue to think critically and ask questions about the things we are fed by the media, that we will start to uncover the truth about what's really behind the scenes in some of these situations. It's easy to get wrapped up in one point of view versus the other and stick to it, but we also have to be willing to take in
            <em>
             all
            </em>
            pertinent information pertaining to these massive events to see if they are just unfortunate circumstances, or if we are being duped into supporting a specific agenda without even knowing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was this a false flag? I honestly don't know, but I do feel that the oddities surrounding that day deserve to have a closer look. They may turn out to be just that; oddities. But at least we didn't just follow blindly behind the media shepherd, but instead asked questions.

            of course not, but the local Govt had been planning a drill for that exact time, and location.........kind of like the drill at 9-11, and the drill on the same day in London, the list goes on and on...

            So, I'm just going to point out (since this has been referred to several times in other videos/pics) that at 3:00, there is a woman pushing some type of red cart (it doesn't really look like a stroller, but I could be wrong), and it happens to have a yellow balloon attached to it. If you watch closely, the woman stops just short of Tsarnaev as if to wait for crowd traffic to pass. In this moment, Tsarnaev turns his head around to look at her and at the same time she is stopped there, she takes her sunglasses off her head and puts them on. I mention this only because there are several pics/videos of other people taking the time to put their sunglasses on even after the bomb went off, which may indicate that these people were in on whatever was going down that day. Also, the yellow balloon has appeared
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFwwaxkDCgU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFwwaxkDCgU
            </a>
            in other places where the brothers are following closely behind.
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like right after the woman departs quickly back into the crowd traffic, Tsarnaev takes his phone out to either make/receive a call, then shortly afterward the bomb goes off. Now, I have no idea if this is one huge coincidence but damn, that's the first thing that stuck out at me when I watched the video. Considering the other references of yellow balloons possibly being used as a tracking point for the brothers, or the people who happen to put on their sunglasses right before they do something, it just seems extremely strange to me that it would be just a coincidence. I guess you'd have to decide for yourself on this one.

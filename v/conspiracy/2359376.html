<p><strong>I was researching Valentine\'s Day in relation to the Satanic calendar because of the following crime:</strong> </p>
<p><em>A former Virginia detective with the Madison County Sheriff’s Office, who was most recently assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, was sentenced today in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville for multiple charges of sexually exploiting minors</em></p>
<p><em>Bruce Arlie Harvey, 42, of Reva, Virginia, pleaded guilty on Aug. 14, 2017, and was sentenced on Jan. 25, to 276 months in prison for three counts of transporting a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in criminal sexual acts, three counts of interstate travel with minors with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct and one count of possession of child pornography.</em></p>
<p>*Additional evidence presented during the guilty plea revealed that at the time of his arrest on May 3, 2017, investigators recovered a Sony microcassette in a bedroom closet that contained a <strong>film clip dated Feb. 14, 2007, that showed one of the victims performing a sexual act with Harvey in his Madison County home.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Mighty strange that this sick LEO was filming his Valentine\'s Day child rape, and found guilty of trafficking. Wondering who he didn\'t rat on due to his steep sentence while others are skating by.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moving on to see what the Satanic calendar has to say about Valentine\'s Day...</strong></p>
<p><em>This page exists to warn Christians of the danger that can be found in Satanism, the occult, and Satan’s many earthly holidays that have been sold to Christians as “Christian Holidays,” yet they are rooted in paganism, idolatry and Satan worship.  Many of these Christian Holidays are sold to the masses, by making them a time for “fun, family, candy, gifts, dressing up, romance &amp; lust, food and tradition.</em>” </p>
<p><em>Minor Sabbath: February 14 – Valentine’s Day</em></p>
<p><em>February 14- Valentines day is a pagan festival that encourages love and physical lust.  It is celebrated precisely 13 days after Imbolg, thus imprinting upon it the number “13”, Satan’s number of extreme rebellion.  While most people view this day as the day to honor your wife or your significant other, this celebration is steeped in paganism.</em></p>
<p><em>Consider the camouflaged occult gods in Valentine’s Day</em>:</p>
<pre><code>**Cupid**- the son of Venus, is really Tammuz son of Semiramis
**Venus**- daughter of Jupiter is really Semiramis herself
**Jupiter**- the head deity, a sun god
**Nimrod**- (Semiramis’ husband) is considered a sun god in the Babylonian Mysteries

<p><strong>Nimrod</strong></p>
<p><em>In Freemasonic myth, not only was Nimrod the founder of the Babylonian monarchy, he was also the Grand Master of all Freemasons and the builder of many wondrous cities in the land of Shinar. He was also the demonic genius behind the Tower of Babel, a tower that would reach to Heaven: which was the first co-ordinated assault on Heaven by the incipient five thousand year old Luciferian Conspiracy for World Government inspired by Organised Evil</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Wanting to know more about this Satanic celebration of Valentine\'s Day, I looked deeper into the calendar...</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Satanic calendar doesn\'t even recognize February 14th, but it does have March 15th and 17th with no details other than to say these dates are the &quot;Eides of March.</strong> <a href="http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm">http://www.theopenscroll.com/hosting/SatanicCalendar.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>But, what exactly are the Eides of March? Or rather, the <em>Ides</em> of March</strong></p>
<p><em>In the play – and in reality – Julius Caesar was indeed assassinated on the ides of March – March 15 – in the year <strong>44</strong> B.C. In the ancient Roman calendar, each month had an Ides. In March, May, July, and October, the Ides fell on the 15th day. In every other month, the Ides fell on the 13th. The word Ides derives from a Latin word which means “to divide.” The Ides were originally meant to mark the full moon, but because calendar months and lunar months were different lengths, they quickly got out of step.</em> <a href="http://earthsky.org/human-world/beware-the-ides-of-march">http://earthsky.org/human-world/beware-the-ides-of-march</a></p>
<p><strong>But the Satanic calendar spelled it as \'Eides\'</strong></p>
<p><strong>According to Google translator, \'Eides\' is German and means \'statutory\' in English. What does \'statutory\' mean?</strong></p>
<p><em>enacted, created, or regulated by statute</em> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statutory">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statutory</a></p>
<p><strong>Then, it hit me</strong></p>
<p><em>While Donald Trump will be the 45th president, he will be only the 44th person — the 44th male — to actually hold the job.</em> <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/20/donald-trump-44th-45th-president-grover-cleveland/96832494/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/01/20/donald-trump-44th-45th-president-grover-cleveland/96832494/</a></p>
<p><strong>Caesar was murdered in 44 BC as stated in the citation prior to the above info.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remember this?</strong></p>
<p><em>But when Caesar’s enemies took out their knives and killed the Trump-like leader on the senate floor, no one was laughing.</em></p>
<p><em>For a moment, there was absolute silence in the outdoor theater of nearly 2,000 people. The conspirators onstage themselves seemed overcome. One of the assassins tried to shout a triumphant slogan, “Liberty!” or “Justice!”, but the words came out flat, drained of any meaning. Blood was on Caesar’s shirt, knife gashes in his blazer, blood pooling on the floor.</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/12/donald-trump-shakespeare-play-julius-caesar-new-york">https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/12/donald-trump-shakespeare-play-julius-caesar-new-york</a></p>
<p><em>An assassination 2,061 years in the making: Trump, \'Julius Caesar\' and the politics of theater</em> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-political-theater-20170622-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-political-theater-20170622-story.html</a></p>
<p><strong>More intersting info about Caesar\'s assassination</strong></p>
<p><em>The Ides of March feels special for a couple of reasons: it\'s the day Caesar was murdered, and it\'s the subject of a soothsayer\'s spooky prophecy in William Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar.</em></p>
<p><em>The truth is actually more interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>For one, we know who the soothsayer was and what he really said: he was named Spurinna, and he was from Etruria. That\'s important, because Etruscans were known to specialize in divination. Cicero\'s letters , Plutarch, and Suetonius all confirm his high status. As notably, Spurinna\'s warning to Caesar was more complex — and more accurate — than the type of prophecy most modern skeptics would dismiss.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;They have a lot of contacts,&quot; Strauss says, &quot;and they\'re people who know what\'s going on.&quot; That would have made Spurinna\'s prophecy a more frightening bellwether of the anti-Caesar sentiment in Rome. Soothsayers could poll the elites, and the elites did not like Caesar.</em></p>
<p><em>On February 15, Spurinna said he found a bad omen: a bull without a heart (it\'s unclear if the bull was a genetic abnormality, a shocking sign, or a soothsayer\'s poetic license). After that, Spurinna told Caesar to beware for the next 30 days, not just on the Ides of March. It wasn\'t a lucky prediction but rather a calculated assessment of Rome\'s political climate.</em></p>
<p><em>The end date of the prophecy wasn\'t a coincidence, either — on March 18, Caesar was going to embark on a multiyear military campaign that would take him away from Rome. The assassins had to kill him before he left.</em> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/15/8214921/ides-of-march-caesar-assassination">https://www.vox.com/2015/3/15/8214921/ides-of-march-caesar-assassination</a></p>
<p><strong>Maybe all of this means nothing, but one thing\'s for sure... All roads lead to Rome</strong></p>',

           <em>
            The Ides of March feels special for a couple of reasons: it's the day Caesar was murdered, and it's the subject of a soothsayer's spooky prophecy in William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            The truth is actually more interesting.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            For one, we know who the soothsayer was and what he really said: he was named Spurinna, and he was from Etruria. That's important, because Etruscans were known to specialize in divination. Cicero's letters , Plutarch, and Suetonius all confirm his high status. As notably, Spurinna's warning to Caesar was more complex — and more accurate — than the type of prophecy most modern skeptics would dismiss.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            "They have a lot of contacts," Strauss says, "and they're people who know what's going on." That would have made Spurinna's prophecy a more frightening bellwether of the anti-Caesar sentiment in Rome. Soothsayers could poll the elites, and the elites did not like Caesar.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            On February 15, Spurinna said he found a bad omen: a bull without a heart (it's unclear if the bull was a genetic abnormality, a shocking sign, or a soothsayer's poetic license). After that, Spurinna told Caesar to beware for the next 30 days, not just on the Ides of March. It wasn't a lucky prediction but rather a calculated assessment of Rome's political climate.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            The end date of the prophecy wasn't a coincidence, either — on March 18, Caesar was going to embark on a multiyear military campaign that would take him away from Rome. The assassins had to kill him before he left.

            I will never, ever have another flu shot again as long as I live as it may just kill me when I am older. I had the actual flu only twice in my life, once a head flu when I was 9 and the next time directly after a flu-shot from the doctors, which made me dangerously sick about 35 years later. I am not the only one, it is proven that the 'empty virus shells' are not always as empty as they like, plus the body still reacts to their shape and will start to fight them, which will make you feel ill. 
Lastly, it's not that you'll get immune after a shot either as each virus is a different strain and you'd need very specific vaccines for each one, every time they are around. No thanks. better just wash your hands, stay away from sick people if you can and take vitamins.

            The problem is the old vaccines did work and kept working fairly well but were not patentable since they existed for a while. So someone had to claim their new and improved varient was better (and often made fake studies showing it to work) and those are being peddled as vaccines when they are essentially sugar pills. Private capitalistic funding has no place in medicine, especially vaccines which essentially are the biggest thread to for profit medical industries (they ouright prevent diseases someone wants you on pills for life that you pay for).
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't even go into the evergreening bullshit the USA allows about old effecive vaccines that are somehow new and improved by adding 1-2 ingrediants and magically gets the BRAND NEW PATENT stamp.

            I hate how people conflate being skeptical of semi-mandatory, ubiquitous vaccines with being a liberal hippie loon.  If people say that the "scientific consensus" says that they are safe (while ignoring countless pieces of evidence) and the government starts mandating it, I am immediately skeptical.

            My relative had her 6 yr old son get a flu shot. Not even 24 hours later, while at school, he lost all the feeling in his arm and half his face. Drooling from one side of his mouth, I don't think he could speak either. Had to take him to hospital. He didn't realize his arm went numb but then he saw the toy he had in his hand laying on the floor. The doctors said it wasn't the shot, yet he never had an episode like this before and was always healthy.

            I've never taken one and I refuse to ever take one. My father worked for a place that required the employees take the flu shot. He had never been sick other than a seasonal cold occasionally. He never had a headache in his life. He didn't understand how a headache felt. After he took the mandatory flu shot when he was around 40 years old he started getting a cold regularly, no matter the season. He also started getting headaches that soon led to migraines. He also swore it was because of that flu shot.

            It's blatant eugenics. If you cannot survive being injected with toxins and poison while you are sick with the flu, then you are not the type of worker they want to breed. They seem to want workers that survive but stay sick, and then pay for healthcare and pills for as long as possible.

            I don't believe they can run enough tests to prove that this non mercury mercury vessel is in fact safe. The body does all kinds of things that enter the body and the adverse effects can sometimes only be found decades later.

            Except there are equally many experts that say mercury is bad. Before you reply with your feelings, think about it. The experts are wrong when they say putting poison in your body is good for you.

             Go to whale.to. Read up on vaccines. It's a conspiracy type site that gets a bad rap, but the researcher who put it together is right on almost everything but some of the spiritual stuff. You're on

             anyway, so you must be questioning the narrative at least some. I have read all over. Books, online, magazines. I would never give my kids vaccines. A healthy child can weather all the childhood diseases just fine and it will actually build their immune system to get them.

            not in hard sciences. although the biologist gets rules from the chemist (who gets rules from the physicist), they are required to know (or learn) the "why" for their subject. doctors just take the final rules (all of them) and interpret them for treatment and patients. this is no small feat, i'm not belittling them, there is a ton of information; i'm just saying that they have no idea why mercury, and if it is actually safe.

            I have been suspicious that the powers that be are pushing very very very hard on the anti vaccine narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            You see it all the time in movies and tv: the poison is in the shot, so the people that
            <em>
             don't
            </em>
            take the shot are the ones that survive. They are making it
            <em>
             too
            </em>
            obvious that they want you to mistrust vaccines.
           </p>
           <p>
            In reality it is much easier to kill off vast quantities of people by releasing disease into the population. You don't have to modify it at all, you can just send it out via::blankets, immigrants, tainted food, tainted water, or infected animals. We have tons of historical examples of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            It does wonders, First: you kill off the disloyal people that don't trust the government. Second, the powers that be look all knowing and wise for protecting their status quo from whatever plague that they engineered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vaccines are not profitable. The pharama companies make more money off of erectile dysfunction pills and cancer treatment than they do off of vaccines. So why make them?

             You answered your own question. It's so the big pharma investors can profit off how sick it makes you, and even make some cash while killing off the weak.

             Sorry, but what are you smoking? Vaccines are a 20 BILLION dollar industry. There are over 100 new vaccines in the pipeline of all the major manufacturers. They can't wait to get in line. Are you shilling or just trolling? It's a cash cow like you would not believe.
            </p>
            <p>
             My sister was working for Sanofi Pasteur while they were developing their latest vaccine against dengue fever, whose clinical trials just finished this year. She told me she quit after she became disgusted that all the seminars and presentations were just about profits, and not about the people or the cure of disease. It was all about finding the most lucrative markets and maximizing the returns.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure, it's a business like anything else, but when the main driver becomes profits, then you're on the road to corruption and false science. The vaccine industry has been on this road for a LONG time, and there's plenty of accumulated garbage in that machinery. Plenty of it, and most people are completely oblivious to it.

              You got a source for that number? It looks a little low. It costs a lot of money to research a new vaccine, and when the patent expires everyone and their brother starts to make it.

              I disagree. False science does not sell. Unfortunately corporate science is far less corrupt than public sector science and university research. Don't believe me? Look at all the redactions coming out of China and the University system. They are too obsessed with printing papers that they don't care about peer review and results. Public sector science is also heavily politicized. If one party is in office, it will push an agenda regardless of the truth. No, we are stuck with corporate science.

              People will not help others out of the kindness of their hearts. Unfortunately we will have to invent some sort of motivation for them to do this. Money is the best thing we have come up with so far.

             they use other things to preserve it now. The small amount there is harmless. Also, don't trust a guy who is telling you to eat radioactive caesium.

               Well that's an insult to all engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's a better comparision: doctors are like the person sitting at the cash register of a big store. They know they're in a store, they know it sells a lot of "stuff", but they don't have a clue how the store really operates, who keeps the store supplied, or the exact details of the products they are ringing the cash register for.
              </p>
              <p>
               That's all doctors are. They are trained to be clueless salesmen for the pill pushing medical industry. They get a nice looking golden rim diploma on the wall, and get to wear a white coat so they feel important, but all they really are are pill pushing puppet salesmen for the medical industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               Source: I've dealt with a lot of "doctors" for well over 20 years. When 90% of the time the patient knows more than the doctor, you start to realize they know jack shit. They are all nothing but indoctrinated robots.

                I didn't mean it as an insult. They take the rules and apply them to the world, but they don't always know why. For example, a power EE will say "for this distance, and underground, this current, and this voltage we need to use this cable in this conduit". A more specific example is that they use charts for how dangerous switchgear is instead of integrating the curve, because when they started caring it was difficult to integrate a curve with different parts and with different error values on each part.

                They need to know a lot of things (just like doctors) and put them all together in the real world, but they don't need to know why.

            Actually ObamaCare is the biggest fraud, flu shots are second.

            I agree.  Seasonal 'flu ' shots are  a crock. I don't agree that it is the greatest medical fraud in the history of the Earth however.

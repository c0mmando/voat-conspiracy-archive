            <p>
             There are at least 239
             <em>
              documented
             </em>
             cases of the United States military conducting secret germ (bioweapons) warfare experiments on people without their knowledge
             <em>
              in just the 20-year period
             </em>
             between 1949 and 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
             If an individual did any of these horrible, horrendous acts, that person would be labeled a terrorist and sentenced to death. What happens when the terror is committed by our own nation’s military?
            </p>
            <p>
             Here are just a
             <em>
              few
             </em>
             examples.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1950, the Navy sprayed the entire city of San Francisco with an aerosol spray containing several microbes from 43 locations. Fluorescent particles of zinc-cadmium-sulfide were added to the mixture to measure the impact. According to their estimate, nearly all of the city’s 800,000 residents inhaled at least 5,000 particles. One person died.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1965, the Army released a bacteria at Washington’s Greyhound bus terminal and National Airport. The result? “More than 130 passengers were exposed to the bacteria and traveled to 39 cities in seven states…” The Army has also released spores in turnpike tunnels and bacteria into subway systems on record. They have sprayed “simulated” germs into the air over military members and their families at several military bases.
            </p>
            <p>
             These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. A comprehensive list of U.S. government human experimentation horrors can be
             <a href="http://www.rense.com/general36/history.htm">
              found here
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course the military explains away all of their illegal activities with the magic words “national security.” Do you feel more secure knowing that they have committed, at a minimum, 239 violations of the Nuremberg Code?
            </p>
            <p>
             The Nuremberg Code was drafted in 1947 to avoid the type of human experimentation committed by Nazis in the concentration camps… a lot of good it did here in America, considering our government secretly brought over a lot of those Nazi scientists and gave them jobs and free reign to continue their horrid human experimentation under Operation Paperclip.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of this begs the question: if there are at least 239 documented cases then how many cases are not documented?
            </p>
            <p>
             How many events are not known or have not been brought to the light of day?
            </p>
            <p>
             How many more have occurred since 1969?
            </p>
            <p>
             What is being done to us right now?

<p>The Court should also consider Seleznev’s obstructive and intransigent conduct
during this prosecution. First, Seleznev provided perjured testimony to this Court and the
district court in Guam, where he made his initial appearance. In an effort to persuade the
Court to release him, Seleznev stated in a sworn declaration (in Guam) and in sworn
testimony (to this Court) that the arresting agents physically abused and mistreated him.
Three federal agents testified at the hearing, however, that no one so much as raised their
voice with Seleznev. To the contrary, Seleznev was allowed to smoke cigarettes and use
silverware, and was even given his choice of entrée on the flight to Guam. Based on this
testimony and photographic evidence consistent with it, the Court made a finding that
Seleznev’s claims of abuse were not credible. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seleznev’s conviction comes more than a year after he was convicted in a Seattle court on 38 counts of cybercrime charges, including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. The Seattle conviction earned Seleznev a 27-year prison sentence — the most jail time ever given to an individual convicted of cybercrime charges in the United States.</p>
<p>The son of an influential Russian politician, Seleznev made international headlines in 2014 after he was captured while vacationing in The Maldives, a popular destination for Russians and one that many Russian cybercriminals previously considered to be out of reach for western law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>However, U.S. authorities were able to negotiate a secret deal with the Maldivian government to apprehend Seleznev. Following his capture, Seleznev was whisked away to Guam for <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3673513/Seleznev-US-Atty-Sentencing-Memo.pdf">more than a month</a> before being transported to Washington state to stand trial for computer hacking charges.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department says the laptop found with him when he was arrested contained more than 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, and that evidence presented at trial showed that Seleznev earned tens of millions of dollars defrauding more than 3,400 financial institutions.</p>

<p>What is gang stalking and electronic harassment?
Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form.
Electronic Harassment is when someone uses any electronic device to aid them in invading your person or property for the purpose of gathering information illegally, or for the purpose of causing harm. Electronic Harassment comes in many forms and types. It can be used for surveillance, sabotage, interference, directed energy weapons, etc.</p>
<p>Organized stalking is probably a better term than “gang stalking” since it more accurately conveys the systematic nature of the crime, and it avoids creating the erroneous impression that the activity is connected with street gangs.
Gang stalking is organized harassment at it\'s best. It the targeting of an individual for revenge, jealousy, sport, or to keep them quiet, etc.</p>
<p>It\'s a psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators.&quot;
Most targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken.

            Hmm. Maybe I haven't been paying as close attention to him as you have, but looking at his comment history I don't really see anything about gang stalking. I do see him complaining about being persecuted, so maayybe this is him... but I don't know. I've seen people post about gang stalking in conspiracy forums before (it's usually a bit out there as far as conspiracy theories go, but it's not like something that's entirely out of the blue here or off-topic is what I'm trying to convey). I do see that the OP here has submitted essentially the same post yet another time, which makes it appear a bit spammy. The whole copying and pasting content from links instead of just linking to the page directly, or offering some kind of self-authored rundown of the subject sets off red-flags.
           </p>

            I dunno. I think it's plausible that it's GOT but it could just as easily be someone who's really interested in gang stalking, or it could be someone just trying to spam up the subverse and make it look super paranoid. I guess I just was feeling a little overprotective of the OP on the off chance that it isn't GOT but someone who might not understand why they're being attacked. :s

            I hope you'll forgive my skepticism, but by what basis do you claim that this user is an alt of GOT? I see that this account has posted a similar post with almost the same content twice before this one on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            , but they've all been downvoted despite this being pretty much the quintessential conspiracy theory (i.e. "people are conspiring behind my back to make me look paranoid and crazy and ruin my life").
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: has GOT made some comment recently about gang stalking?

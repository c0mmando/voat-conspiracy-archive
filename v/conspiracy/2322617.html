            Well they are quoting the wrong part of scripture. The thousand years of Christ's reign don't happen till Christ returns... When he returns everyone on earth will know it, and it won't be a secret, so only cultists believe that we're currently in the "thousand years of peace".
           </p>
           <p>
            If they start out not even getting scripture correct, they probably aren't going to be getting much else right imo.

             One of the people named by the Ancient Egyptians as being part of the Sea People Alliance was named ''Shekelesh'', SHEKELesh. Sea People were based out of Phillistine, close to where the (((Hyksos))) is said to stem from, Hyksos were of course, the Proto-Israelites. HMMMMM, could our tribal buddies been behind the sea people too? Wouldn't suprise me.

            <p>
             But we know for sure they are behind the massive immigration today.

            Difficult to approach it head-on without it explodes in the face. There is danger of civil death.

            Yet it is the capital question. I hesitated.

            Especially since in 1973, by publishing "The Camp of the Saints", I have already pretty much said everything about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not have much to add, except that I think the carrots are cooked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because I am convinced that our destiny of French is sealed, 
because "they are at home with me" (Mitterrand), 
in a "Europe whose roots are as much Muslim as Christian" (Chirac), 
because the situation is irreversible until the final changeover in the 2050s 
who will see the "native French" to count only half - the oldest - of the population of the country, the rest being composed of Africans, North Africans or Blacks and Asians of all origins resulting from the inexhaustible reservoir of the third world, with strong Islam, including jihadists and fundamentalists, this dance is just beginning.

           </p>
           <p>
            France is not alone concerned. All Europe is going to death. The warnings are not lacking - UN report (which is pleased), essential work of Jean-Claude 
Chesnais and Jacques Dupâquier, in particular -, 
but they are systematically obscured and INED pushes for misinformation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The almost sepulchral silence of the media, governments and community institutions 
on the demographic crash of the Europe of Fifteen 
is one of the most staggering phenomena of our time.
           </p>
           <p>
            When there is a birth in my family or friends, I can not look at this baby 
from home without thinking of what is being prepared for him in the carelessness of "governances" 
and what he will have to face in his manhood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides the "native French", clubbed by the tom-tom throbbing 
human rights, of "welcome to others", of "sharing" dear to our bishops, etc., 
framed by a whole arsenal of repressive laws called "antiracist", conditioned from early childhood to cultural and behavioral "miscegenation", the imperatives of "plural France" and all the excesses of ancient Christian charity, will have no choice but to give up 
and to merge without protesting in the new mold "citizen" of the 2050 Frenchman.

             </strong>
            </strong>
            Surely, there will remain what are called in ethnology isolates, powerful minorities, maybe fifteen million French - and not necessarily all white - who will still speak our language in its nearly saved integrity and will persist in remaining impregnated with our culture and our history as they have been passed down from generation to generation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will not be easy for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Faced with the different "communities" that we see forming today on the ruins of integration (or rather its progressive inversion: it is us that we integrate to "the other", now, and not the opposite) and which in 2050 will definitely and probably institutionally installed, it will be sort of - I'm looking for an appropriate term - of a community of French durability.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will rely on its families, its birth rate, its endogamy of survival, its schools, its parallel networks of solidarity, perhaps even its geographical zones, its portions of territory, its neighborhoods, even places of safety and, why not, his Christian faith, and Catholic with a little luck if this cement still holds.

            After that ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then France will no longer be populated, all origins combined, only by hermit crabs who will live in shells abandoned by the representatives of a species forever disappeared, which was called the French species which didn't announce, by some unknown genetic metamorphosis, the one that in the second half of this century will be called by this name.
           </p>
           <p>
            This process is already under way.

             <strong>
              THE SECOND HYPOTHESIS: THE "RECONQUISTA"
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a second hypothesis that I can not formulate otherwise but in private and that would previously require that I consult my lawyer, is that the last isolates resist until they engage in a kind of "Reconquista" (read «De la Reconquête Française» - by Marc Noé) probably different from the Spanish one but inspired by the same reasons. There would be a perilous novel to write about it. I will not do it, I have already given.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its author is probably not yet born, but this book will be timely, I'm sure. What I can not understand and which plunges me into an abyss of perplexity, is why and how so many knowledgeable Frenchmen and so many French politicians knowingly concur, methodically, I do not dare to say cynically, to the immolation of a particular France (let us avoid the qualifier of "eternal" which revolts the "beautiful consciences") on the altar of exacerbated utopian humanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            I ask myself the same question about all these ubiquitous associations of rights to this, of rights to that, and all these leagues, these thought societies, these subsidized back rooms, these networks of manipulators infiltrated in all the workings of the State. (education, judiciary, political parties, unions, etc.), these countless petitioners, these properly consensual media 
and all those "intelligent" who day after day and with impunity inoculate their anesthetic substance in the still healthy organism of the French nation.

              THE RENEGADES OF FRANCE
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if I can, at the very least, credit them with sincerity, I sometimes find it hard to admit that they are my compatriots. I feel the word "renegade" but there is another explanation:
            <strong>
             <strong>
              they confuse France with the Republic.
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Republican values" are declined infinitely, we know it until satiety, but without any reference to France.
           </p>
           <p>
            France is first and foremost a carnal country.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, the Republic, which is only a form of government, is synonymous for them ideology, ideology with a large "I", the major ideology.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              It seems to me, in a way, that they betray the first for the second.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Among the flow of references that I am accumulating in thick files in support of this assessment, here is one which under a good-natured outside illuminates well the extent of the damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is extracted from a speech by (((Laurent Fabius))) at the Socialist Congress of Dijon, May 17, 2003:
            <strong>
             <strong>
              "When the Marianne of our town halls will take the beautiful face of a young French immigrant, that day France will have taken a step forward by fully living the values ​​of the Republic. "
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we are quoting, here are two, to conclude:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              "No number of atomic bombs can stop the tidal wave of millions of people who will one day leave the southern and poor part of the world to break into the relatively open spaces of the rich northern hemisphere, looking for survival. (President Boumediene, March 1974.)
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            And this one, taken from the twentieth song of the Apocalypse:
            <strong>
             <strong>
              "The time of the thousand years ends. Behold, the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, equal in numbers to the sand grains of the sea, coming out. They will go on an expedition on the face of the earth, and will invest the camp of the saints and the beloved city. "

That's just clearly not the case. 2% of 300m = ? You guessed it. 6 million. That alone should tell you that that number is just pure bogus.

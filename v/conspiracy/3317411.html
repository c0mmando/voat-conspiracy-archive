            Of critical note is Judaisms antagonism with Esau and his descendants the Edomites.  This is the origin of "gingers have no soul" category of humor.

            Some main take-aways from the article are as follows:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Redheads do process pain differently due to the fact that the variance MC1R gene that causes red hair also affects the brain, pain perception and other processes. Meaning: there are legitimate biological differences associated with red hair versus everyone else.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Many of the publicized cases of DID - including Kim Noble, Jenny Haynes and others have clearly natural red hair. Other individuals not known to have DID but who are associated with ritual abuse imagery
              <strong>
               and pizzagate,
              </strong>
              like Arrington de Dionyso, also have red hair.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Red is the rarest hair color on the planet, and DID is seen in a tiny percentage of the population: common sense would indicate that the vast number of people with DID and red hair should be statistically improbable if it were due to random chance.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In attempting to account for this trend, there are a few explanations that come to mind, including:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Rh Negative blood factor. There is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that those with Rh-negative blood are more likely to have red or red-tinted hair. At this time no scientific study has linked the two, so this potential explanation remains frustratingly impossible to prove. HR Giger, who showed insider knowledge of pizzagate coded symbols, also made reference to Rh factor in at least one piece of his art.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Neanderthal DNA. It was commonly believed that the known intermingling of Neanderthal and human DNA in Western Europe may have been the origin of red hair, but that theory has
              <a href="https://archive.is/GmibZ">
               since been debunked
              </a>
              .
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Red Haired Giants. Although the most outlandish potential explanation, it actually has more evidence surrounding it than either of the two previously mentioned theories. Red haired giants have been documented in myth across the Americas, and physically unusual red-haired mummies are openly on display in South America, specifically Peru. DNA testing has reportedly indicated that some parts of their genetic code is of unknown origin.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Rather than assuming that this unknown DNA is the result of extra-terrestrial or "Nephilim" inbreeding, I think it is likely that these abnormal individuals who appear quite commonly in the historical record, especially around mound-builder sites in the Americas, represent an evolutionary cousin of modern humans, which was both physiologically and
            <em>
             behaviorally
            </em>
            different in comparison with modern man. Oral histories suggest these individuals were horrifically violent and cannibalistic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this unknown species the ultimate source of ritual abuse, cannibalism, and the ritualized splitting of the psyche into fragmented selves? Is it the source of, or associated with, Rh negative blood?
           </p>
           <p>
            Though subjects like Rh-negative, red haired giants and the intermingling of Neanderthals with humans are well known and have been explored by many others, the discussion of red hair in terms of multiple personality disorder (DID) is unique to my knowledge. It is currently impossible to reach a definitive conclusion on what might be driving this connection, and multiple theories discussed in this article may be connected in some way to this finding.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope other researchers will add to the thoughts presented here in future, and fill in more of the missing pieces of this picture.

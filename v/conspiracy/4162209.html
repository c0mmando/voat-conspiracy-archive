            Starbucks, Coca-cola, and McDonalds are the worst offenders of putting harmful ingredients in their foods, yet every american loves eating their garbage. People are fucking dumb as shit and brainwashed. Us awakers need to wake up the sleepers about this. The only way we can make a change is if enough people demand change. But so many people are so brainwashed, it's an uphill battle.

            Sugar is also as addictive as cocaine or alcohol so adding it to foods makes the foods more addictive do they get more repeat customers at a higher frequency which shows they don't care about your health, but not that they are trying to make you sick. If you get sick they do not care but I think the goal for them is $$/power.

            Pretty obvious. The grand plan is to get us as sick and docile as possible. How is this achieved? Subsidize soy and corn so that their products can be injected into everything and sold for a lot less without compromising profit margins.

            Carbohydrates, especially sugar, in excessive amounts, is hell on insulin balance and response. I have learned that all the issues associated with obesity are a product of this insulin issue and obesity itself is a symptom like all the rest. Therefore, by stabilizing insulin balance and response, every other health issue should disappear.

            It is what popularized keto since it focuses on eating the very foods that the establishment desperately wants to forbid: red meats, cheese, eggs, etc. These foods have demonstrated to be highly beneficial for the body and all the so-called bad issues associated with it are actually caused by carbohydrates.

            Strangely, for some arbitrary reason, they frown upon doing experimental studies with nutrition and would rather depend on surveys and epidemiological studies. Further investigation has revealed that these studies is what allowed them to demonize fat and idolize sugar. Investigating experimental studies has also revealed that their narrative is a farce.

            Also if we don't have the proper nutrients we crave more food. They take out the nutrients and we have to keep eating in order to feel full. Most of our pasta is bleached!

            Used to make coolaid, for two quarts found 3/8-1/2 cup of sugar was needed to be sweet just before tasting metallic, directions call for 3/4-1 cup.  As big as cutting the sugar in half was, still too much sugar so had to go.

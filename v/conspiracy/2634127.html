            The following testimony is from Gio Rios, who is among the many people who experienced terror at more than one location. This is an abridged version of the full published account found here. Rios and his girlfriend escaped the gunfire at the festival venue only to hear more, later gunfire at the Tropicana. After fleeing from there to hide in a dumpster, they subsequently fled again after later hearing (and seeing, allegedly) yet another burst of gunfire - which Rios described as coming from the direction of either the New York-New York or the MGM Grand, the two casino resorts on the north side of the Tropicana Avenue-Las Vegas Boulevard intersection (this is the location of our first video above, 'Las Vegas Strip manhunt for multiple gunmen'):

            </a>
            Note that Rios also described unusual encounters with unidentified individuals 'assisting' people that night, leading him to consider that accomplices at ground level may have played a role in directing or influencing panicked crowds.
           </p>
           <p>
            From these eyewitness testimonies, we get a sense that the gunman, or gunmen, firing at these other locations along The Strip were not intent on carrying out further massacres. Rather, they may have intended to cause panic that would distract and delay first responders and - as the police themselves can be heard speculating - divert police teams away from the festival venue and Mandalay Bay.
           </p>
           <p>
            With tens of thousands of people directly affected these events, it's a wonder that there isn't a lot more footage taken from cellphones, and a lot more live-streaming and tweeting about them. This is in part due to an injunction, heavily programmed into people in the US, against filming active shooter situations and 'giving away information' about their location because the gunmen may use such it in real time to evade the law. The dark irony here is that this reluctance to document the event has assisted the authorities in covering up that there were any shooters at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adding to the atmosphere of dread, the entire Strip went into 'lock-down' from about 11:45pm, with messages like this blaring through every resort. Although it is unknown if any of the gunfire at these other locations resulted in deaths or injuries, police report finding gunshot wound victims at various resorts later that night. While it is probable that these victims were from among those shot hours earlier at the venue, who had since returned to their hotels, it is possible that the gunmen may have shot people on The Strip or adjacent streets. Additionally, police may have actually successfully targeted one or more of the gunmen. One eyewitness claims to have seen police shoot someone dead - presumably one of the gunmen - outside Hooters:

            Another eyewitness (named as Jake Freedman or Jack Friedman depending on the media report), told ABC News that after witnessing the venue massacre from the Skyfall Lounge at the top of the Delano resort next to the Mandalay Bay, he twice went downstairs to the ground floor. The first time down, he saw pandemonium as people fled for safety from the venue. When he ventured downstairs a second time, the ground floor of the Delano was deserted, so it was some time after the massacre. He says he encountered police officers there who told him to "run away", after which he heard gunshots close by, leading him to think that police may have been "dealing with the shooter":

            </a>
            With Paddock dead in suite 135-32 of the Mandalay, this would obviously not have been 'the' shooter but another shooter or accomplice. There is a report on the first police scanner audio that potentially corroborates this eyewitness's testimony. At time-stamp 54:15 - so, at roughly 11pm - a police officer describes a suspect at the Delano:
"We are near the Sports Book at Mandalay Bay. We have one male wearing a... WMA [white adult male] it looks to us... maroon or black shirt. [shouting in background] He didn't listen to us... in towards the Delano."
Recall Jake's description of the location where he heard shooting; in the walkway linking the Delano to the Mandalay Bay. The Sports Book Grill restaurant is located along this walkway: Elsewhere, at the Tropicana, Joe Napoli and about 1,500 others who were holed up there until 4am were not allowed to leave until each person had been frisked for weapons. Why, if the police knew by that point that there was only one gunman shooting from the Mandalay Bay, would they set up a TSA-style operation to 'clear the area'? Napoli, by the way, when asked if he saw any bullets, said he saw "casings on the ground" by the entrance to a back door into the Tropicana, though it's unclear whether he meant actual bullets or shell casings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Survivors have reported hiding in bushes, dumpsters, containers, and under cars for up to several hours after the event, and up to five miles away from the concert venue, as they fled in terror from one shooting scene then another. Many extraordinary accounts have been published detailing the harrowing lengths festival attendees went to to find safety. Hundreds broke through airport perimeter fences, fled across two runways, and didn't stop until they reached the airport terminals. Some didn't even stop there, and continued wandering all night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rob Frediani fled the venue believing it was coming under "terrorist attack" because he called his wife who told him media was - at that time - reporting "multiple shooters at different hotels." Running into the food court of the Excalibur Hotel for safety, he said "aloud noise there" caused people to instantly scatter "in every direction." He and a friend found an unlocked stairwell and fled all the way to the roof of the Excalibur, where they "grabbed pipes" and "locked the door behind us," in case a gunman followed them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Los Angeles casting director Shaun Hoff and his wife, who were attending the festival, estimate that they ran in a northerly direction for two miles, stopping for shelter in a parking lot at the Planet Hollywood resort. Within 10 minutes, they were on the run again because "someone started shouting that there was an active shooter at that hotel." The couple continued walking around Las Vegas in a daze, entered a parking garage for refuge, then hitched a ride with people leaving for Ontario, California. Once they got there, they took taxis to their home in Los Angeles. They had left everything behind in their Las Vegas hotel room, fleeing almost 300 miles to escape the chaos in Vegas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's recap: Paddock was found dead at 11:20pm. Some of the calls to police concerning gunmen at other locations on The Strip were made before this time, but most were made afterwards, so even if we assume that these were all false reports intended to cause a diversion, Paddock could not have been making the later ones. Assuming instead that the calls were made by either the resort staff or guests, are we to believe that all those people were imagining things?
           </p>
           <p>
            The authorities, assisted by the media, are implicitly suggesting that 'all the other stuff' that happened in Vegas on the night of October 1st was fantasy produced by traumatized victims of the festival massacre. Taking into account the sheer geographic range and time-span of reports of gunfire, the intense paranoia described by festival attendees with respect to accepting assistance from passersby, and the subsequent media blackout about the true scale of this event, I think it's as clear as Vegas under a neon sky that the authorities are conspiring in a cover-up on behalf of the real perpetrators - plural - of the Las Vegas terror attack.

            One guest at the Aria told her story to Irish media:
"All of a sudden there was a bit of a commotion and people started to run. At first, we weren't really sure what was happening but I could hear popping sounds and obviously that was gunfire, but we didn't realise it at the time. Then people were running, it was like a stampede. Because there was such confusion, no one knew what was happening. The reception area cleared out - people lay down on the floor. We ran out to the front of the hotel, people were talking, said there was shooting at the Mandalay Bay hotel, which wasn't too far from us because we could hear the gunfire. When we walked back through the casino to get to lifts to the room, there were no staff to say what was happening other than pit boss - it was eerie."
Note the highlighted sentence above: this tourist cannot have been hearing gunfire from the Mandalay Bay. Firstly, it is one mile away from her location, and she is indoors. Secondly, like so many in Las Vegas that night, she was only alerted to the fact that something was going on by the presence of (or hearsay about) active shooters reported at her specific location, so she only learned about the massacre at the concert venue after the fact. Because she has since been told by the media that there was only one shooter and only one shooting episode in Vegas that night, she is assuming that the Mandalay Bay is located close to the resort she was staying in, thus conflating the brief gunfire she heard at or outside the Aria with the heavy gunfire that came from the Mandalay an hour beforehand.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the suggestion that panic 'spread up the Strip' from the festival venue doesn't make sense. There are many accounts from guests who were at Caesar's Palace and other resorts describing how they had no clue that anything had gone down at the Mandalay Bay until they were spooked 'in place', and only then stopped what they were doing to check out what had happened earlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also have footage of panic erupting at Caesar's Palace, a scene for which the first police report of gunfire comes in at about 11:28pm:

            Then there is this brief footage of panic at the MGM Grand resort:

            In responses to her followers, this eyewitness tweeted these real-time updates on the situation at MGM Grand:
            <a href="https://www.sott.net/image/s21/425582/full/MGM_shooters.jpg">
             https://www.sott.net/image/s21/425582/full/MGM_shooters.jpg
            </a>
            Note that there is no corresponding police report about this incident at the MGM Grand on the published scanner audio, and thus absolutely no mention of it in the media, even as a 'false report'.
           </p>
           <p>
            We referred to Rene Downs' testimony in our previous article. Downs filmed the scene on the ground floor of the Bellagio around two hours after panic erupted there at about 11:20pm. She also posted a second video showing the scene there the morning afterwards. Downs has since given interviews detailing her account, and others present at the Bellagio have corroborated it. This complete interview with Downs is worth listening to, but here is an abridged version:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89D8pxjJtg">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z89D8pxjJtg
            </a>
            Note again that Downs - and apparently everyone around her at the Bellagio - only learned about the massacre after the gunfire and panic at her hotel, one hour after the shooting ended at the concert venue, along with reports about shootings at other nearby resorts, at which point everyone conflated the Mandalay event with the later events and spent the next few terrifying hours assuming - correctly, it seems - that gunmen were prowling all around them. So, again, the melee at the entrance to the Bellagio cannot have been panic caused by some 'delayed fear-response' travelling up The Strip; it has to have been provoked by a separate, later gunfire incident there, or very close by.
           </p>
           <p>
            From her room upstairs at Planet Hollywood, Megan Thompson saw people running across pedestrian bridges connecting the Aria resort with the Cosmopolitan and Planet Hollywood, with their hands raised as SWAT police searched for a gunman. From her vantage point, she could also see commotion as police arrived at the Bellagio. The following video is excerpted from her full account published here.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w7DWSJc6RU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w7DWSJc6RU
            </a>
            Note Thompson's final comment that she hoped that pictures of the gunmen would not be 'shown all over the news', presumably in the expectation that doing so would give them the attention they craved. At the time, she couldn't have known that all reference to gunmen shooting up and down the Strip would be completely left out of the official account of what happened in Las Vegas that night.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, downstairs at Planet Hollywood, here is footage taken by Dimitri Ioakim from inside the resort's casino shortly after gunfire was heard or reported inside or nearby:

            </a>
            Orora Monroe was also inside the Planet Hollywood casino when, she says, she heard loud gunfire, coming from either inside or adjacent to the resort, which she estimates occurred at about 11:20pm. Unaware that anything had happened at the Route 91 Festival, Monroe fled in panic as the casino floor emptied, remaining in lock down at that resort until 3am, when she returned to her room at the adjoining Elara by Hilton hotel.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the following video - which is an abridged version of the testimony she provides here - Monroe describes the gunfire she heard, the reports she heard that night from casino staff and Metro police about similar incidents up and down The Strip, and the aftermath as Las Vegas went silent about 'all the other stuff' that happened there that night:

            </a>
            Three weeks on and there's still no proper account of what happened on the Las Vegas Strip on the night of October 1st 2017. The official investigation and mainstream media coverage has focused on the massacre at the Route 91 Harvest Festival venue, apparently conducted exclusively by 64-year-old gambler Stephen Paddock from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino resort, providing the public with a nonsensical timeline and a highly suspicious explanation of events as detailed by Joe Quinn in this article.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since then, survivors from among the 22,000 people in attendance at the venue, along with other guests, residents and employees present on the Strip that night, have begun speaking out about what they saw and heard and to say their statements diverge from the official narrative would be a massive understatement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Comparing police reports on published audio recordings of the Las Vegas Metro Police Department (LVMPD) scanner with videos taken by multiple eyewitnesses, along with eyewitness statements made to the media on the night, and in published testimonies they have been making since then, a picture emerges of terror and chaos deliberately spread over a much larger area than just the venue, a picture that casts further doubt on the official story of a lone gunman.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media has glossed over the reports of incidents at other locations by reminding us that police scanner audios are unreliable accounts of what did or did not happen. If a police unit is assigned to travel to a location where gunfire was reported in order to investigate the presence of an active shooter, and they then report back 'Negative shots fired at this location', we may correctly assume that nothing happened there and that whoever made the initial call to police was mistaken.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with making this assumption, in this context, is that on the night of October 1st into October 2nd, there were so many calls to police about 'shots fired', at so many different locations along South Las Vegas Boulevard (aka 'The Strip'), and up to two hours after shooting from the Mandalay Bay had ended, that a police officer radioing in to 'clear' the presence of a threat at any given location is unlikely to arrive in time to see a gunman who has already moved on to another location (and whose patrons are in the process of frantically dialling 9-1-1). The footage captured by taxi driver Cori Langdon right outside the Mandalay Bay - besides being of interest because it appears to contain audio of both distant and close automatic gunfire - is also interesting because she was listening in live to the LVMPD scanner. On her video we overhear a police report that is not heard on this 'full' published scanner audio that covers the same time period.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not to suggest that 'false' or 'edited' versions of the police scanner were published after the fact, but it does highlight that live-streamed or published scanner feeds are not necessarily complete records of every report made in and around events like this. First responders are at times communicating on different channels, talking over each other, or their reports are 'enclosed' and not relayed to central dispatch. Prior to 'breaching' suite 135-32 of the Mandalay Bay, we hear an officer suggest setting up a separate channel for exclusive use by the units that had arrived at the Mandalay Bay. At other times, we hear officers exchange phone numbers for two-way communication.
           </p>
           <p>
            This changing-up between channels explains why we hear apparent non-sequiturs on the scanner: police officers at times seem to be 'confirming', 'responding to' or otherwise following up on previous communication between officers that we are not privy to. So yes, it is true that police scanner audio is an unreliable account of what did and did not happen, but that rule of thumb also means that there is likely more that went on than the broadcast/published scanner audio tells us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have found three published scanner audios that synch up to form one continuous record of the LVMPD scanner broadcast that night, lasting from roughly 10pm to 4:30am. I do not claim that this is a transcript of all police radio communications that night. Others may have scanner audio from within that time period that includes reports I did not hear. From the three that I do have, I have faithfully transcribed what I found to be relevant reports and communications, made by officers who were either reporting on-scene or relaying from a central police office, and have included these transcriptions in the annex below. I may have misheard some things, or not included data that may in fact be pertinent. In the interest of having as useful a scanner record as possible, I welcome suggested corrections or additions.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first audio records the opening 1 hour and 22 minutes of police activity, beginning with the first report of gunfire coming from the Mandalay Bay, at roughly 10:05pm, and ending circa 11:30pm. We know at what time it ends because the LVMPD states that suite 135-32 of the Mandalay Bay was "breached" by SWAT units at 11:20pm, which we hear on this audio 10 minutes from the end. The reports in the first half of this second, shorter scanner audio overlap with the last 15 minutes or so of reports in the first audio. The remaining 11 minutes of this second audio therefore extend our record of police scanner reports until roughly 11:41pm. Finally, this third audio begins, based on the opening reports we hear officers investigating and discussing being follow-ups to the last reports we hear at the end of the second audio, almost exactly (likely within minutes) where the second audio ends. The third audio therefore covers the period from about 11:42pm to circa 4:30am.
           </p>
           <p>
            These scanner audios are therefore also useful as a timeline of events that night. They are imperfect, but they can be roughly synched with key events in the official timeline to give us an idea of what was happening where and when. The key point with respect to timing is that Stephen Paddock was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 11:20pm, right around the time an explosion of reports about gunfire at other locations comes through on the scanner.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's this intense activity at locations north of the festival venue and the Mandalay Bay (which continued into the early morning hours) that has been completely excised from the official version of events in Vegas that night. If these were indeed 'false reports' generated by confusion following the venue massacre, then there should be no evidence of gunfire at other locations. But citizens who were there say otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first reports of gunfire occurring somewhere other than the concert venue and locations immediately adjacent to it begin at time-stamp 56:57 on the first police scanner audio, which is roughly 14 minutes before the Mandalay Bay raid, i.e. at about 11:06pm. Multiple calls are made to police about gunfire inside or next to the New York-New-York resort. In quick succession, we hear of suspects "pinned down" as far north as the Circus-Circus resort, a possible car-bomb in the Luxor resort, and gunfire at the Tropicana resort. The flurry of reports leads the central dispatcher to broadcast this report at about 11:16pm:
"Be advised, we're getting multiple calls of active shooters at multiple locations. May or may not be diversions."
Four minutes later they find Paddock dead in the Mandalay Bay, and then more reports come in of gunfire at the Aria, the Paris, the Bellagio, and Caesar's Palace, which is some 1.7 miles (2.7km) north of the Mandalay Bay. No wonder we hear (on the second scanner audio) an officer suggest, at about 11:31pm:
"Let's get someone on the Boulevard and try and stop this guy from running north anymore."
The following video shows combined footage taken from the two western corners of the intersection of Tropicana Avenue and South Las Vegas Boulevard (The Strip), outside the New York-New York and Excalibur resorts. According to the LVMPD, the FBI and the media, 'nothing much happened' after 10:15pm, when gunfire from the Mandalay Bay ended. However, as should be clear from the footage, filmed roughly one hour later, the police were not just 'following up on calls'; a veritable manhunt was underway:

            </a>
            The opening footage in that video shows police hunting for someone outside the New York-New York, and was taken by Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Max Michor, who tweeted that he had heard gunfire just moments before: Here is additional footage of police activity near this intersection, showing a SWAT team entering the Tropicana casino. I place this intervention at about 11:46pm, when we hear that "a strike team of six" is "gonna hold the Tropicana."

            </a>
            What followed was a cascade of reports about active shooters and possible suspects, at up to a dozen locations along Las Vegas Boulevard, and some adjoining streets:

There is footage from some resorts of people fleeing in panic. The following video shows a few moments of the panic that erupted at the Aria resort, one mile north of the concert venue, after apparent gunfire there. It was first reported on the police scanner at 11:21pm:

             Just as citizens of fifty years ago could not meaningfully participate in society without phone or electricity service, today’s citizens cannot meaningfully participate in the modern world without an online presence, expressed through the dominant online communications platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and YouTube.

            I do not have an online presence other than under many assumed names.

            At NO point have I used my real name for anything online that wasn't banking related.

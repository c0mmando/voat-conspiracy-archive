            It's well documented that Hillary's lifelong dream has been to be the first woman President.  If they needed a fall person, they could have picked anyone.

            I think I see what you are trying to say(if not troll). As far as my non tin foil hat theory goes, I'm trying to stick to facts. There is much speculation and hearsay pertaining to why the FBI didn't do it's job. I can't really comment because I don't know. All I know is there was more than enough evidence to recommend charges against HRC....but they didn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as pleading the fifth when having immunity...well...she's not called Killary for nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I were FBI and worked this case, I would do exactly what you are saying they are doing. The frustration over this bullshit must be excruciating.

            You can't tell me that 150 FBI agents, working for months wouldn't look at Killary's right hand man's computers for emails? No...you can't. And this is where the main stench is coming from. That and the timing....?
           </p>
           <p>
            My non tin foil hat theory is that the deal(threat) that Comey was forced to take(to save his life?) was that only emails pertaining to the initial Killary investigation were to be excluded. What to do? Run a classic parallel investigation, a la Weiner sex scandal, and get her that way. That and Trump is now a sure thing and they are trying to save face. Would make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have heard about the internal conflict at the FBI about this....but seems way too convenient.

            Thx for the downvoats but at least try to prove me wrong so I can get this shitthought out of my head. This whole FBI thing looks like it was all planned to bring Hillary down, right before the election(to justify the vote) from the getgo.Stinks to high hell. But only time will tell...I HOPE I AM WRONG!

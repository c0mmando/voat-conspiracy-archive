            is the study I was referring to.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as vaping colors and flavors, we already inhale artificial flavors every time you smell them, and we eat them all the time. Those chemicals go into our blood all the time through our digestive system.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as studies go, there have already been hundreds on VG and PG vapor, there have been thousands on artificial colors and flavors, and there have been thousands on nicotine. There isn't any evidence that any of these products are so harmful that they should be banned. And none of them ever will, but putting them together may be banned, that is the strange part.
           </p>
           <p>
            Carry risks? Most likely, but everything carries some kind of risk. Living in LA you have much more risks over living in Cody Wyoming.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the government was that interested in our 'safety' and the safety of those around us they would ban bald tires, trans fats, and loud music.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as using PG, it hits differently than VG, I typically mix the two 20/80

            Nicotine has been proven to increase brain functions, and people with early signs of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are sometimes prescribed a nicotine patch or other nicotine delivery device.
           </p>
           <p>

           </p>
           <p>
            So to say that the government want's to ban nicotine because it makes people more "aware" or offsets the effects of "chemical poisoning" may not be that far off.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the idea that many local governments are banning vaporizers is insane, there is absolutely no reason to do so, yet they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it were truly about the health of the smoker and the people around them, not only would vaporizers be 100% legal, they would be encouraged. But they are being lumped into the same category as cigarettes. Even though countless studies have found no negative health effects for "second hand vape", yet there is a ton of misinformation and propaganda against vaporizers.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's literally PG, Nicotine, and Esters.
           </p>
           <p>
            PG is in fog machines, baby toothpaste, soda, ice cream, and on, and on
           </p>
           <p>
            Nicotine is in Broccoli and cauliflower, and the health effects are similar to caffeine
           </p>
           <p>
            Esters are in every food that has "artificial flavors", so basically every food.
           </p>
           <p>
            E-cigs are harmless, yet they are being banned all over the place, Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe OP is on to something.

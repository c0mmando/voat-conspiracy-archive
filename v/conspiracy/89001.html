            So ok, I'm going to try to play devil's advocate.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the people rioting and making a fuss over freddie gray's death, any police activity is going to be heavily scrutinized - and that's in general a good thing, but as police they're likely perceiving the entire thing as an overreaction, that anything they do will be sensationalized and twisted into racism and misconduct. So they're afraid to do their jobs when there is a chance they will be attacked for it, despite not believing they were doing anything wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the way this video played out, it looked like there were a lot of phone calls and the decision not to arrest came from higher up. Since this was a minor offense (gambling in public?) it really wasn't worth the potential risk of triggering another riot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Taking off my devil's advocate cap now, I'm of the opinion that if gambling publicly is a civil offense, and legally there is no reason to justify taking the person to jail, then it's great that the camera prevented over-use of force. The fact that they were saying they had to take him to jail, and then later decided they didn't have to because it was a civil offense and not a criminal one, really shows them in a bad light.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's important to understand what the culture in the police department is probably like when stuff like this happens, and I'm really thankful for this video and that it captured some seemingly candid expressions from the officers.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if police develop a distorted perception of non-police as being more criminal than they really are, simply because the bulk of the non-police they interact with during the course of their jobs are in fact criminals. It seems like if that is true it would explain in some ways the young cop's attitude, that it's better to lock this guy up than let a potential criminal go free.

            <p>
             While I detected a bit of real dissension in the ranks, I perceived a bit of overacting here. It's like they wanted to be heard saying those things to build sympathy for police and to scare the public.

             You even had one guy acknowledging the idea that the video would wind up on youtube!

               I wouldn't go that far. I just think a few of them hammed it up for the cameras. I mean, what you say is certainly
               <em>
                possible
               </em>
               but I wouldn't even say it without evidence.
              </p>
              <p>
               The point would be -- "to build sympathy for police and to scare the public." That didn't cover it?

                You're right, I apologize. I latched onto the "overacting" bit, and the resulting feelings I had as a response to the video, and ran with that while glossing over the suggestion that it was to build sympathy for the police.
               </p>
               <p>
                I mean, I'm fairly certain that the guy saying "jeeze, this will probably end up on youtube" or whatever was thinking that mocking the police recording videos would probably make him look better. It could be that I'm overthinking this whole thing. xD

            If camera presence prevents an arrest then that arrest shouldn't happen in any case. Law is done in the light for all to see it's purity, if you doubt the law in your own hands then you shouldn't exercise it.

             exactly right. Being an officer shouldnt just be a job. It should change the person's outlook on life itself, and transform them into a model citizen and outstanding public servant, yet current officers RARELY know the law they enforce. Its a goddamn travesty.

              It shouldn't change you as a person, but going into the job you should know that you exist to maintain rules and protect people. If you throw away people to protect rules or throw away rules to protect people then you are no longer a police officer.
             </p>
             <p>
              A cop should know every rule they enforce to some extent and should definately know all the procedures and what to do when they are not sufficient or they break down. If you can't maintain the standards and rules of your profession then you should find another job. A police officers world is rules, their own and their charges be they criminal, witness or bystander.

               I have to disagree on the first point. If someone is going to force me to follow laws, they absolutely should know them inside and out, and be able to be a model for other citizens like me to look up to. If a cop wants me to respect the law and his/her authority, then they should be worth respecting. I look at it this way; Joe Shmoe on the street isnt going to bark commands to me and me follow them blindly. I dont know him, he doesnt know me. As it stands right now, with the police recruitment and standards they are held to, it may as well be Joe Shmoe wearing the badge.
              </p>
              <p>
               In my opinion, to be a police officer should require that person to be the absolute best version of themselves they can be, on and off duty. Police officers should be held accountable for what they do even moreso than an average working citizen specifically
               <em>
                because
               </em>
               of the nature of their work. They are public servants, entrusted with the duty of carrying out the law, and delivering justice to the citizens they serve. Being a cop is not just some job. If it is just some job, then what authority do they have?

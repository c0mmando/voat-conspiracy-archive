<p>Initially it took me awhile to figure out how I felt about Comey. He is connected as fuck, not evil, but compromised. He is in over his head, but he has acted with some courage. The DOJ has been pushing back on him and outright threatening him. He didn\'t pursue but he made a public statement in Congress that he didn\'t &quot;have to&quot; do.

<ul>
<li>
<p>The Weinermobile E-Mails are not damning to Hillary [with specific regard to the e-mail case], but they are damning to a large number of high ranking people, or the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>Two possibilities are the damning revelations about Huma\'s private use of E-Mail, or the FBI got information which gave them leads or answers in existing Pedophilia/Human Trafficking cases.</p>

<p>The only thing that falls short for me is the info that Hillary sent e-mails to her Filipino House-Assistant to print out for her at home. How the fuck is that not criminal?</p>
<p>But maybe although there is nothing about the E-Mail case they are going to pursue, they might bring charges on others, immediately following the election so as not to be attacked as trying to manipulate the election.</p>

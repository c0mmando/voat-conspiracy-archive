            The worst part about the kiddy porn charges is that this is exactly what intel agencies do. They are pimps to children. They regularly use pedo situations to entrap and control (franklin cover up , Jimmy Saville anyone?).

            Who has the files? PUBLISH. Otherwise this kid is never seeing the light of day from his cell.

            Reminds me of the X-files...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Agent Mulder accidentally stumbles upon a crime scene. When Mulder asks what the man he's looking for has done, the detective at the scene tells him that the man was putting child pornography on the Internet. This turns out not to be true and was just fabricated by the Syndicate to discredit the man. When Mulder confronts him about it, he says "What is it? Kiddie porn, again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states."

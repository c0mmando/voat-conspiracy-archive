<p>A new documentary claims rapper Tupac Shakur is still alive after faking his own death and fleeing to New Mexico where he is being protected by the Navajo.</p>
<p>The film alleges Shakur escaped from University Medical Center in Las Vegas after he was gunned down in 1996.</p>
<p>Shakur was hit four times in a drive-by shooting as he was being driven by notorious record producer, Suge Knight, after watching a Mike Tyson fight at a casino in Sin City. </p>
<p>The 25-year-old was struck in the chest, arm and thigh by the four .40 caliber rounds.</p>
<p>The legendary musician died in hospital from his wounds six days later and the killer has never been caught, despite numerous theories over the identity.</p>
<p>But filmmaker Rick Boss purports that Shakur did not pass away in hospital and in fact sneaked out of the ward and fled to New Mexico to start a new life.</p>
<p>In the explosive new documentary, 2Pac: The Great Escape From UMC, Tupac Shakur, Boss claims the rapper is being protected by the Navajo tribe.</p>
<p>Boss says the Native American tribe, who live throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah for a perfect hideaway as FBI agents are not allowed on their land. </p>
<p>The filmmaker alleges the rapper arrived in Las Vegas for fight night and was told of a planned hit on him. </p>
<p>That was when the escape plan, involving planting a double in Knight\'s BMW to a strategic aerial exit by helicopter, was born. </p>
<p>Boss told KTNV: \'After the shooting. What\'s next? This movie is about Tupac actually escaping from University Medical Center here in Vegas and relocating to New Mexico.</p>
<p>\'Getting protection from the Navajo tribe. When certain FBI agencies are looking for you, they are going to block the airport.</p>
<p>\'So you can\'t travel out so the best way to escape is through helicopter, private helicopter to another state.\' </p>

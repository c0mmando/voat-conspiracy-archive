            This message is brought to You by a very tired and happy “puppet” lol Would you believe I haven’t slept in 4 days?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is true that The Grand Deception, is that Space (as we've been taught) is a Lie
           </p>
           <p>
            (Please see the Illuminati Playing Cards)
           </p>
           <p>
            ---&gt; The Earth is not a spinning ball ---&gt; “Flat Earthers are indeed on to something.”
           </p>
           <p>
            But here is where it gets even trickier, our entire reality is in fact an illusion. (A magnificent, perfect illusion --- and one that is indeed very, very malleable --- it is pure magic --- And is so awesome!!!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also our God, for all intents and purposes really is a Dog. We Love Him SO Much. And He Loves All of Us Unconditionally. And I really mean it --- he loves everyone --- axe murders, Saints, Fools, Jokers, Champions, Heroes WAKE UP!
           </p>
           <p>
            He created this world as an adventure for all of us to learn and grow.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know it sounds so absurd, but everything in our reality is quite literally backwards and upside down.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just an incredibly absurd and glorious game. So please don't ever be scared and know we have already won!  It is our destiny --- this play was written for US!
           </p>

            This has been a BREAKING transmission from the Joker and the Fool

            Okay Fam, I'm gonna to need to see a little more enthusiasm here!
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are Parts 4 and 5 because Fuck this Hourly Quota Limit Bullshit ;)
           </p>
           <p>
            Part 4: A Gentle Rant and Musings upon The Grand Deception --- Clarifying Questions Continued:
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever wondered, if maybe, just maybe, everything they've ever shown us about the world wide space program is as fake as all the false flags we've been scammed with over the years?
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you ever really looked at the pictures that NASA has shown you of the planets, moon and stars?
           </p>
           <p>
            What do you want to bet that NASA has never landed on the moon or that there have never been any rovers on mars? That every picture ever shown to us of the earth from space (and everything else!) is filmed in a Hollywood basement?
           </p>
           <p>
            What if aliens are the psy-op? And it's actually just demons or jinn tricking us in another form?
           </p>
           <p>
            We all know whose side Hillary and Podesta serve.
           </p>

            Truth
           </h1>
           <p>
            There are spiritual forces at play that are manipulating all of us around like puppets. Believe it or not, it's us. (Hint: The SOL --- The Sun)
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a grand illusion and we are in an epic battle. It Is Time for us ---&gt; the Jokers, the Fools and the Champions to unite and wake up! The world is soon going to need us.

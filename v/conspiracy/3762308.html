            There's a lot of blahblah about the phrase "decentering whiteness". Decentering whiteness: dismantling privilege in the interest of racial justice. It means removing whites from the focus of discussion. The accusation is that you're trying to distract focus from Group Z because you don't care about them. As you may expect, when whitey is the target of decentering, it's fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the other hand, consider the source. You know the racist caricature of the black man embiggening hisself with sophlisticatum verbations and grandilious compstrumptions? Or little kids babbling about scitifig spearments conducted on scatterlights and space sations? Yeah, you're probably dealing with a mixture of these.

            Except this is literally the opposite of the foundation of their worldview. Everyone is literally identical and interchangeable. It doesn’t matter if Germany is full of nothing but 80 million nonwhites AS LONG AS the number stays the same, it will be the same.

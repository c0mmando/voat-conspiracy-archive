I am a fellow truth seeker just as curious as the rest of you trying to piece all these bizarre clues and stories together into a narrative that makes sense. A few months ago I stumbled across a book I would like to share with the community that I feel helps lay a strong foundation for understanding how the world came to be the way it is. This alternative history has really helped me make sense of the world and fitting in all the phenomenon and chaos we observe into a narrative that allows everything to make sense - and the scale is larger than most of us could imagine. The book is <strong>The Gods of Eden</strong> by William Bramley, and can be read for free at <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf">http://www.whale.to/c/Gods_of_Eden_Bramley.pdf</a> (also available on Amazon). It is a long book that covers human history from the ancient civilizations to the late 20th century and was written by an attorney seeking to understand why human history seemed to be defined by a constant state of war - only to discover a strange pattern of UFO/ET involvement. What he discovered is bizarre but captivating, and I am excited for all of you who choose to take the red pill and plunge down this rabbit hole. I won\'t say too much about the book in this post, as I seek only to introduce it to the community in the hopes we can bring it into future discussions and begin to better understand the scale of the battle our souls are witnessing. I will say you should never forget that you are all from &quot;the source&quot; (GOD), a place of unconditional love and incomprehensible (to us) consciousness and only when the power of love overcomes the love of power will the world know peace.
TL;DR - Please read <strong>The Gods of Eden</strong> by William Bramley.</p>',

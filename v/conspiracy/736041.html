            Europe is not dependant on russia because of gas, as we have our own sources. The only part that is semi dependant on them for various reasons is eastern europe, and you dont think that poland or romania actually get to make decisions that affect the big european players. As such your whole theory is invalid.

            Also, as a member of the "general population": I have to endure what now? Rape and crime? Gee I wasnt even aware I was being raped! If only someone would have told me! Then I totally would have joined in on the fearmongering!

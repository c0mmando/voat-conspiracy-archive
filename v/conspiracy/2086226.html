Israel has no &quot;defense in depth&quot; - the ability to fall back into your own territory until your enemies\' supplies get low and you can counterattack (think Soviet Union in WWII). Israel is only 70 miles wide at it\'s widest point. You could send a tank battalion through it in a day without warning. This means Israel had to be constantly vigilant, with a hair trigger, and ready to go all out with little warning. (If you haven\'t heard of the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Samson_Option">Samson Option</a>, it\'s where Israel has made it known it will nuke the rest of the world with its undeclared nuclear arsenal if Israel is ever lost.

<p>Since WWII, <strong><em>several entire generations</em></strong> of Europeans have grown up with an uncharacteristically peaceful life.

              The (((elites))) always have MULTIPLE goals for the plans they enact.  Like Iraq and Afghanistan.  Its like arguing if the oil or opium was more important!  No!  The answer is both!
             </p>
             <p>
              So for the migrant crisis, was it to depopulate Israel's neighbors, or to flood the West, with the aim of producing a mixed mongrel race?  The answer is both!  Even if the populations didn't mix, you could endlessly pit them against each other, which keeps them from taking a step back and spotting the puppet master pulling on the strings.  Divide and conquer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do some reading about Coudenhove-Kalergi, the Rothschilds (Israel is their personal fiefdom), and Eretz Israel (Zionism, with the whole world defined as Eretz Israel).

            may be... i think israel is shipping in beasts to europe because it needs to radicalize the european population to finish off middle east once and for all. israel needs our help to fight the kabab but we are only interested in libertard ideas... by shipping in a million beasts europa will chimp out as in past and finish the job in middle east that usa and israel started.

             Well if Europe ends up fighting off the migrants, then attacks the Arabs for Israel, that's just another win for Israel. Yet another example of "let's you and him fight" by Israel.

             You say Israel needs our help... Do you think we
             <em>
              should
             </em>
             help them? I don't. Israel  always been a terrible ally.

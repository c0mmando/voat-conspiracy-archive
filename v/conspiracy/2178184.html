            He donated 9 million to Obama and the democrats. Money they refuse to return, disavow, or donate, which means they are still in his pocket and owe him favors. I bet one of those favors was a blow job from the daughter of the potus. Obama and the rest of Hollywood admit that they were well aware he was a serial rapists for the past 20 years. They only admit that he's a pervert who likes to shower naked in front of some actresses. They probably had no idea this could be used as a tactical nuke against Hollywood in the meme war. God bless the meme warlord Mike Cernovich.

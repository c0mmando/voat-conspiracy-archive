            Prove it wrong? Okay. This is essentially SJW bullshit. How? This is whining about a "demographic change" in a panicked, pearl clutching way. Oh, noes? What do? Well, someone else had better do something! I was never asked about these changes! Someone save me!
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously -- you are your culture. I have some complaints about immigration, but they're not really germane. If you don't like the demographic shift and feel racially threatened, there's an answer: Fucking. Fuck a lot. Fuck up a storm of little Aryans. Keep fucking until there are too many "whites". Move to other countries and out fuck them. Hell, you could out-fuck most of Asia.
           </p>
           <p>
            But ask me to get up in arms about it? Seriously. Fuck off. I've outlined how to do it above.

              I did watch. Get to fuckin'. Why stop at holding on to "traditionally white countries"? You could colonize places if you fucked enough. It worked for Rome and it worked for England. Most of Asia -- Japan and China, particularly -- are particularly primed to be out-fucked. Look at Mormons. They're your shock troops. They practically fucked their own culture into existence. Complaining about what is being
              <em>
               done
              </em>
              to you won't improve your demographics. A family of 12 will.

            Well of course when you combine and classify "non whites" as a single race and statistically stack them up against "Whites" as another single race eventually Whites will become the minority. This kind of statistical sleight of hand preys on the ignorance and fears of apprehensive whites. Then to use loaded terms such as "genocide" is very disappointing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we break up the races into Latino, black, Asian, Arab, Native America, etc then, in the US, Whites are in no danger of becoming a "Minority". This kind of fear baiting is driven by a very, not so subtle, nefarious form of racism.

             Your logic is incorrect. You are Correct in that this Video lumps all non Whites together but that it no way nullifies or mitigates The effect of forced inegration. There woul have to be forced integration of whites into places with non whites. One could argue gaza is an example of this bit it is the only one I can think of. There are some military occupations but we typically do not allow our troops to live in the community and they usually don't move to the occupied place permanently. Over time if forced integration continues in one direction the white population will diminish no matter if it is one or twenty other races.

             Yes in the video it did show a very basic animation of white v black, what it was representing was what they called "forced diversity" of people from 3rd world nations, to traditionally white nations. What I find is weird is the the US government will pay for 3rd world people to come live in America for diversity, yet they don't pay for Americans to live in 3rd world countries which would make more sense.

             Well in the vid they give the U.N. definition of Genocide. Scary how much it fits with what they are claiming. If you go to 18:39 you'll see the definition as well. So I do not believe it is a "loaded" word.

             Pandering? Im not running for President of Voat or anything. I could give a crap about internet points. Hell on Reddit I was in the negs. Pander? The fact I even have to bring this up in a conspiracy forum. Shows how forced by the media to think and feel. All I did was find a conspiracy video a little worrisome. All I Want to do is discuss it. Im sure you'll just consider me a white racist, like the rest of us.

            <p>
             What really sucks is we are so conditioned to hate white and diversify. Just bringing up social issues among my race is Racist. What kind of BS is that?

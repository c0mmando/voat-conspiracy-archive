<p><strong>SAMI AL-ARIAN:</strong> And then, the following month, you know, I get invited to the inauguration, and I get a thank you from Newt Gingrich and John Sununu and Tom Davis, that we really delivered that to Bush. And then we asked them to deliver for us secret evidence, you know, the bill against secret evidence. And they tell us that the Bush—because Ashcroft was delayed, his confirmation was delayed, he said it’s going to take time to study the issue. But I get a call back in August of 2001 basically telling me, from the same person, that they’ve studied the issue, and we were going to get—to hear good news. And he asked me to invite all the Arab and Muslim leaders to Washington, D.C., at the White House, in which that news would have been announced&gt; And then, the following month, you know, I get invited to the inauguration, and I get a thank you from Newt Gingrich and John Sununu and Tom Davis, that we really delivered that to Bush.

<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN:</strong> And then what happened? I think it might have—our feed to Istanbul, Turkey, might have frozen, but let’s see if he came back. Sami, you left us by saying then you got a call where you were supposed to invite everyone to Washington for an important announcement.</p>
<p><strong>SAMI AL-ARIAN:</strong> Right. And I did invite everybody, and I briefed them, and I told them that there will be an announcement, an important announcement, against the use of secret evidence by Bush that afternoon. And everybody was in town. Unfortunately, it was on 9/11. It was 3:00 on 9/11. So that meeting never happened. But everybody was asking, &quot;How come all these Arab and Muslim leaders were in Washington, even though the airspace was closed for several days?&quot; And the reason they were behind Bush when he visited a mosque and when he went to the National Cathedral is because they were already there. They were going to meet with him for that announcement.</p>
<p><strong>AMY GOODMAN: Wow!</strong></p>

            I have an Evernote notebook reserved for only the best of informative posts; this is going into it right now. Happily, my Evernote Clipper for Chrome works extremely well on Voat--can't say the same for ReddactIt.

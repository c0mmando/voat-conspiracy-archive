<p>Our culture is owned by a very powerful few, it is not generated by us. Many of you know this, but it needs to be repeated again for those who are unsure or do not know. </p>
<p>This is how we are controlled, because we do not even control our own culture. </p>
<p>CNN does not deliver news, it delivers propaganda. MSNBC delivers Democrat propaganda, Fox News delivers Republican propaganda. Both have endless material of the other being idiots, because they <em>are</em> both idiots. Statist, pro-coporate, anti-american fear-mongering idiots who are all told what to say by AP and Reuters. 5 of the 6 media companies in the infographic as well as AP and Reuters are controlled by Zionists, which is a religious ideology that believes that Jews have a special right the land around Israel, which gives them justification to keep attacking Palestinians. Basically Zionism is a religious shield behind which the Israeli government hides behind while it commits atrocities. It really has nothing to do with religion or race, just with power.</p>
<p>Even TV channels that seem innocuous have an agenda simply because they\'re run by corporations which are profit and power-seeking entities, run by power-seeking people. BET strongly guides African-American culture by creating a culture that African-Americans see as organically African-American, but it is corporate and consumerist. Perfectly materialist. It also controls how <em>white</em> people perceive blacks in America. It does not empower them or us. It is divide and conquer, it drives a wedge between the races. Because blacks in America do not own the media, they do not own the culture. So it is corporate culture, it is consumer culture. Almost all our media is, I\'d guess 95%. This isn\'t to say it\'s without entertainment value, or that it isn\'t good drama or good comedy or what have you. This isn\'t about that. This is about the bias within those shows, certain ideas being unrelentingly omitted, creating a blackout of information in certain areas of knowledge in American culture. Like Noam Chomsky says, “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” </p>
<p>Humans control other humans not with physical fences, but instead fences of the mind, wherein certain areas of thought are cordoned off. If we buy in to the ideologies given to us by the powerful, we end up believing these cordoned-off areas are that way for our own good and so we never explore them out of fear or &quot;respect&quot;. Christianity and many other religions are also very guilty of this. We may be afraid of talking about these ideas in public. We may be afraid of thinking them to ourselves, even in the privacy of our own minds! Who needs a physical fence when you can control what a person is afraid to think about, and therefore do? Reinforcing a culture of anti-intellectualism also strengthens this attitude, it makes people fear the cordoned-off areas more.

<p>Disney Channel, Fox News, MSNBC, HGTV, Golf Channel, ESPN. It is corporate media and therefore promotes corporate culture.

             Yeah, I regret using the "95%" in the title. I posted it on reddit with the word "largely" in place of the 95%. It's also just inaccurate because there's not a complete 1 to 1 relationship between the media and our culture, so while they may own 95% of the media, they may only own (let's say) 80% of the culture, if it's possible to quantify such a thing.

            I'd add to this that the extension of copyright has also controlled and monetized our literary/media heritage. In 1910, the first film adaptation of Frankenstein was made of the 1823 novel, with nary a concern of attribution. Steamboat Willie was released in 1928. We stand as distant from Steamboat Willie as James Whale did from Mary Shelley. What do you think the likelihood of your Steamboat Willie video game surviving public release is?

            Its why they call it a boob tube, I think. Either way its fucked up how much influence the media can have on every aspect of society. At least its not like in the 80's when there wasnt the internet.

            while the media culture is certainly driven by this limited crew, actual culture is driven by additional factors as well.  don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that they have ALL of the power, they most certainly do not.

             The power to influence public opinion is HUGE. It can change an innocent to guilty and the guilty to innocent.

             As long as people buy in to the idea that the views of TV basically represent the views of the public, they
             <em>
              do
             </em>
             have all the power. People are thankfully losing faith in this idea, but it isn't happening fast enough.

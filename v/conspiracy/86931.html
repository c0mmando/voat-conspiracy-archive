<p>Quote from <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/30/history_repeats_activist_tom_hayden_on">Democracy Now: History Repeats? Activist Tom Hayden on Police Brutality Protests from the 1960s to Baltimore</a></p>
<p><em>Edit: more from the Democracy Now interview:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TOM HAYDEN: The late departed, and Bobby Seale. So, we were charged with conspiracy to riot. And a commission later found that it was actually a police riot. The facts came later. In the case of defendant Bobby Seale, who I spoke to the other day—he’s in Oakland—</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: Explain who he was.</p>
<p>TOM HAYDEN: He was the chairman—I was going to—he was the chairman of the Black Panther Party at the time. And he was already in jail for conspiracy to murder. Those charges were also dropped. But in the Chicago case, he asserted a right to defend himself, which is a right that black people got after the Civil War. And so, when his name was mentioned, he would stand and say, &quot;I wish to call a witness.&quot; And the judge thought his standing was not only an insult to order, but a threat to order. When he would talk from a yellow pad, that was a threat. So the judge just one fine day said, &quot;Deal with that man.&quot; And they took him out, and the next minute he’s back in, chained and gagged to a chair. And when I’ve said this to young people and they’ve seen it in movies, they always say afterwards, &quot;Well, that was creative license, wasn’t it? That didn’t really—you’re exaggerating. It’s dramatic fiction.&quot; I said, &quot;No, no, this actually happened not once, but day after day, until it was finally brought to an end.&quot; That happened in our lifetime.</p>
<p>JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the judge eventually severed him from the case and sentenced him to four years for contempt of court?</p>
<p>TOM HAYDEN: Yes, and none of that happened, either. None of the charges held. He never came back to trial. But it inflamed and polarized opinion, one side thinking it reminded them of slavery—clank, clank, clank—when the chains going, and the other side thinking, &quot;Well, he deserved it. I mean, he’s a completely uncontrollable black man. Of course the police must have seen a threat, and they should have tied him up.&quot; It’s amazing how people see things in utterly different, polarizing ways. Amazing.</p>

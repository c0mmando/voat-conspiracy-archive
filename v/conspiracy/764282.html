            The site is hard to navigate. Even if you don't believe the cloning and just accept an Argentine exodus, there's something odd about the fit of this song to the lyrics. Here's what Donald Marshall wrote:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Man Who Sold the World", a song written by pop legend David Bowie, and the title track of his third album, was released in the U.S. in November 1970. This song has been covered by a number of artists, notably by Lulu in 1974, and Nirvana in 1993. Bowie has never explained the meaning of the song. When asked about the song during a interview on BBC Radio 1 in 1997, Bowie replied, "I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for…You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are."
           </p>
           <p>
            In the song, the narrator passes a man upon the stair, they speak briefly and, shaking hands, they part. However, the narrator does not return home, but continues to roam for years and years, until, in his searching, he loses himself to the point where he wonders if he himself has died, alone, a long, long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are left wondering who is the man on the stair? What, in the course of their conversation, did he say that would affect the narrator so profoundly that he embarks on a search for meaning that would take him the rest of his life, and even beyond…
           </p>
           <p>
            We believe this song describes an encounter the young pop star may have had at the cloning center as a REM-driven clone, and it is our opinion that the man on the stair is none other than the late German Chancellor Adolf Hitler.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Illuminati whistleblower Donald Marshall, top-secret experiments in human cloning have been conducted for decades in deep underground military bases around the world. Marshall claims that when he goes to bed at night, his consciousness is stolen while he sleeps and held hostage until his body wakes up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Known as R.E.M-Driven Consciousness Transfer, Marshall maintains that elite scientists use this top-secret technology to transfer his individual consciousness from his residence in Eastern Canada, into his identical clone at a cloning center hundreds of miles away. He explains that this consciousness transfer happens almost every night, even though his real body never leaves the room and continues to sleep throughout the night.
           </p>
           <p>
            We imagine that David Bowie would have been required to attend cloning as a famous young pop star in the 1970s. According to Marshall,  all members of the Illuminati have clones and attend the cloning center nightly, including celebrities, star athletes, politicians; in fact, any person of influence in every field you can imagine. Marshall claims they are forced to meet every night to discuss business, plan future events and engage in perverse sex parties and sick acts of depravity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps the song describes the events that occurred one night at the cloning center, as Bowie was about to climb the stadium steps to return to his seat in the arena, when the singer is surprised to find Hitler descending the same stairs.
           </p>
           <p>
            We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
           </p>
           <p>
            We believe this provides the correct interpretation of the song's lyric: even though I wasn't there…because, in truth, Bowie's real body was not there, but back home, sleeping.
           </p>
           <p>
            The young singer speaks of was and when, believing the official account that Hitler committed suicide in 1945 alone, a long, long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even at the time, there were questions as to whether Hitler was alive or dead. Hours after Joseph Stalin was informed of Hitler's suicide, he wanted the corpse found. Although the apparent remains of Hitler and wife, Eva Braun, were later discovered in a shell crater by Red Army Intelligence, questions remained: Was this actually Hitler's corpse?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the years immediately following 1945, the Russians maintained that Hitler was not dead, but had fled and was being shielded by their former western allies. The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremberg, Thomas J. Dodd, when asked about Hitler's death, said: "No one can say he is dead." When President Harry S. Truman asked Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, "No".
           </p>
           <p>
            Some believe that Hitler did not commit suicide, but instead escaped from Berlin to Argentina, where he lived in hiding until the early 1960s.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Oh no, not me," The man exclaims, "We never lost control…"
           </p>
           <p>
            In the song, the man brags that not only did he not die, but we never lost control. Who is the we the man refers to?
           </p>
           <p>
            We believe the man is referring to the Nazis of the Third Reich.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Marshall, the Nazi Party is alive and well today, with many members within the Illuminati, including royal families, Heads of State and even U.S. Presidents, all secretly loyal to the Nazi Party.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is well known that many brilliant Nazi scientists relocated to the United States directly after the war. Operation Paperclip was a U.S. Intelligence program in which over 1,500 German scientists, technicians, and engineers from Nazi Germany were brought to the United States after World War II.
           </p>
           <p>
            Public records were expunged of any Nazi Party affiliations and false employment histories and political biographies were created for the scientists in order to obtain security clearances from the U.S. Government to work in the United States. Marshall claims the Nazis never lost the war and are still in control today.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what to make of the line "You're face to face with the man who sold the world…?"
           </p>
           <p>
            For how can one sell the entire world, and to whom would he sell it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it possible that the lyrics refer to an agreement that the Nazis are reported to have made with an ancient race of aliens toward the end of the war, in exchange for advanced technology?
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Marshall, the Nazis would receive valuable technology, e.g. flying aircraft, ray-gun weaponry and in exchange the Nazis would build deep underground military bases to provide the aliens with easy access to humans, whom they hunt, terrorize and consume. This agreement is still honored today, where aliens interact with humans deep underground, far away from public knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the Nazis made a pact to partner with this ancient race of aliens, they, in effect, sold out the world…
           </p>
           <p>
            After speaking for a few moments, the narrator bids farewell to the man on the stairs:
           </p>
           <p>
            I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched through foreign lands
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
I walked a million years
           </p>
           <p>
            I must have died alone
A long, long time ago
           </p>
           <p>
            The song ends with the narrator, not returning home, but instead wandering through foreign lands, unclear if he, himself, has died a long, long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            One might ask: How is it possible that someone like Hitler, could be dead for years, yet still live on in deep underground military bases?
           </p>
           <p>
            Marshall explains that the Illuminati can decide who they wish to keep alive by utilizing top-secret technology, not disclosed to the public. In these cases, elite scientists use microchip technology to download one's memories, abilities and personality onto a microchip, which is then implanted into the brain of a fresh, new clone grown specifically for this purpose. As each clone degrades with time, one simply body-hops to the next clone.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not just Hitler, Marshall claims, but many world leaders from the past, live on as chipheads at the cloning center, where they still control the world from the shadows.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marshall cautions, however, that this microchip implant technology is deeply flawed and comes with serious side effects. However flawed, though, Illuminati members still use the tech to cheat death so that they can, theoretically, live forever.
Marshall reports that many are stuck there at the cloning center, held hostage by advanced science and technology, under the control of a secret alien race. Artists and musicians like David Bowie do what they can to embed references into their work, hoping the public will one day put the pieces together and recognize their cry for help.

            Go Pros are available world-wide. Live streaming from one is possible when paired via Bluetooth to a FB or Periscope enabled device. So this was a technological possibility. Why these things are allowed to occur and not be flagged immediately is a good question too.

             Thank you for that. So it is possible if you have medium level tech skills, which he probably had since he knew about 8chan and kiwi farms.

             As to why the account was not flagged, that is a great question. This is turning into "for every answer i receive, two more questions pop up".

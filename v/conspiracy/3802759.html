            Let’s talk about statistics. Let’s talk about the concept itself.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_clearance">
             Q-level clearance exists within the Department of Energy.
            </a>
            <strong>
             What
            </strong>
            the fuck does that have to do with anything regarding the court system?
            <strong>
             What
            </strong>
            does that have to do with
            <em>
             anything
            </em>
            Q-LARP has claimed it knows? Look at the number of people who have Q-level clearance. All none of them.
            <strong>
             What’s
            </strong>
            the likelihood that any of them are committing an executable offense by posting on an imageboard? Look at the posts.
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            don’t they say anything? Someone that important–if it actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit. It’s also not going to ask questions that it doesn’t answer. It’s going to explicitly release real data, with citations, directly from a source. The sum total of Q-LARP is an exercise in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdiction">
             postdiction.
            </a>
            Everything it has said is too vague to actually mean anything. It never says anything of any value or specificity. A combination of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">

            does the rest. PEOPLE ARE LOST. THEY ARE BROKEN. THEY FEEL WORTHLESS AND WEAK AND POWERLESS. WHAT BETTER WAY TO PREY ON THEM THAN TO CONTROL THE OPPOSITION?

             They won’t question you if you can trick them this way.

            Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews. It’s just that simple. In fact, Q-LARP is entirely owned by jews.
            <strong>
             <em>
              It admits it.
             </em>
            </strong>
            It openly admits to being civic nationalist. It doesn’t support a restoration of the US or Europe to being white-only nations. It doesn’t support deportation of nonwhites. Since the first week, it has called for protection of nonwhites, from the whites who would see them deported/killed. It openly calls for regime change in Iran for the sole purpose of fulfilling the
            <a href="http://smoloko.com/?p=3308">
             Oded Yinon Plan.
            </a>
            Q-LARP has publicly stated it has no intention of removing jews from the West or punishing jews collectively.

             What
            </strong>
            purpose is served by leaking the proceedings of nationwide martial law and the arrest of three quarters of the US government…
            <strong>
             <em>
              TWO AND A HALF ENTIRE YEARS
             </em>
            </strong>
            early?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            is that helpful to anyone except the people toward whom it is supposedly directed? Oh, and
            <strong>
             why
            </strong>
            has it taken so long? TWO AND A HALF ENTIRE YEARS of waiting is TWO AND A HALF ENTIRE YEARS to prepare. You realize that even the group that Q-LARP talks about is one of the highest flight risks on earth, right?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would anyone want to give them time to escape?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            does that help us? It doesn’t. It helps THEM. It helps them so much that it hurts us. This is on purpose. Q-LARP exists to create an Orwellian narrative about “the bad people being arrested”, so that when all the good people are arrested they will say that good people are bad people, and the stupid Q-LARPing masses will simply believe it and help commit their own genocide. We’ve already seen this for 70 years.
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            do you think it isn’t continuing?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would someone ostensibly leaking the proceedings not actually leak any information?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would someone who claims to be on our side not give us a playbook for how to operate during the event?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            isn’t it telling us how to become leaders of our community to calm the terrified millions around us–who will inevitably exist once the media starts reporting on the “Trump coup”, or when they see their favorite media reporters arrested by the military live on air?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            is Q-LARP a civic nationalist?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            does that help America?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            is Trump is magically insulated during what will be painted internationally as a soft coup?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would the apparatus allow him to engage in this coup to the extent that he would actually be protected?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            does the coup–by Q-LARP’s own admission–not cover the actual PROBLEMS facing this country? Even if Q-LARP is a real “organization” of a sort, everything it says points to the action as being nothing more than “Part A of the ZOG wants to do something Part B of the ZOG doesn't.”

            If there is something,
            <strong>
             why
            </strong>
            is nothing Q-LARP said would happen happening?
            <strong>
             Where’s
            </strong>
            the Emergency Broadcast System announcement?
            <strong>
             Where’s
            </strong>
            Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people?
            <strong>
             Where’s
            </strong>
            the martial law?
            <strong>
             Where
            </strong>
            are the riots it talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing, and there haven’t been any other riots in the last two and a half years.
            <strong>
             Where’s
            </strong>
            the Huma arrest?
            <strong>
             Where
            </strong>
            are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign.

            Already touched on this at the end of the first section. So Q-LARP’s going to arrest most of the US government, right? All the bad people going away. And what’s this? It says that WE won’t have to grab our guns and help out? Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved!
            <em>
             Don’t ever question the validity of these claims!
            </em>
            Just spend TWO AND A HALF ENTIRE YEARS ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening around the world, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

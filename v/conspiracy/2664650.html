It\'s been conclusively shown by /pol/ that the Parkland massacre was committed by rogue cops and that Nikolas Cruz was just a patsy. The shooters at Stoneman Douglas High School were Detective Jeffrey Gilbert and Detective Carl Schlosser of the Miramar police department. The two officers have been suspended from the SWAT team after being caught on video at Parkland high school during the shooting without the authorization or the awareness of their superiors.

<p>Whether Cruz shot anyone is unknown, but it is known that there were three shooters at Parkland high school during the massacre. In the following video, Parkland student Christina Vega tells a reporter that there were three shooters at the school-

Stoneman Douglas teacher Stacy Lippel stated in an interview that she witnessed a police officer wearing body armor in the hallway firing on students. She also claimed to have been grazed by a bullet fired by the officer, which student Christina Vega confirms-

<p>There is a short video taken from a helicopter or satellite which shows the two Miramar swat cops and two other uniformed police officers loading a bag into a civilian truck while an unidentified driver throws evidence out of the truck window (see attached). The bag is heavy enough to require two people to carry. It\'s unknown whether it is armor and weapons,evidence, or a dead body that the officers are removing from the scene (see video attached).</p>
<p>Broward County sheriff captain Jan Jordan violated policy and refused to allow officers to enter the school and engage the shooters, instead telling them to establish a perimeter. Broward county sheriff Scott Israel refuses to discipline her in any way.

<p>AG Bondi goes on to state, apparently in reference to the two SWAT officers caught at the scene-</p>
<p>“Bondi also said she believes there were people from the scene of the shooting who were not honest with her or the governor.

            Did anyone else watch the events on tv immediately following sandy hook? Sounds eerily similar! Reports from witnesses as well as the police radio traffic indicating multiple shooters running off into the nearby woods. They were dressed in camo if I remember correctly. A cop actually caught one, but the later story was that was just a dad who was running through the woods away from the school?!? Yeah right.

            There are lots of holes in the official story. For example, the location of Cruz' arrest was given on the official police timeline of events document, as "Wyndham Lakes Drive, Coral Springs". There is no Wyndham Lakes Drive in Coral Springs, there is only a Wyndham Lakes Boulevard, South and North. I can't believe that they would have got the name of a street in their neighbourhood incorrect. (.pdf)

            The teachers and students saw too much they saw too many shooters so the other cops shot one of their own and killed him so the other cops killed those people and one of their own and vanished his dead body that's him in the body bag.

            Others said there were other shooters. Official story has Cruz wearing his maroon redshirt however a teacher said she saw from 20 feet away a shooter in full military armor and helmet , mask and all. Another teacher said he was Told they were going to run an active shooter drill and he thought they would be using blanks. Somethings just don't add up here﻿

            This girl Alexa is NOT a crisis actor because her testimony DEBUNKS the official story. Crisis actors always SUPPORT the official story. Her behavior and facial expressions are totally believable. The reason she is smiling is because she is also surprised about the fact she walked and talked with the alleged shooter Cruz while the shooting was in progress.
           </p>
           <p>
            This testimony coupled with the teacher Stacey Lippel who said that she saw the shooter and he was dressed in full military armor and helmet proves that this was a government false flag operation. Cruz is just a patsy.﻿

            Cruz is a patsy. He was setup so the state could try to steal his $800K inheritance his dead step mom left him. That's why they are holding his brother for $500K when normally it's only $25 for trespassing. FL is corrupt. He was jumped by a gang of Hispanic and black kids (someone said that chic marching participated) she even admits to bullying him. He's a #targtedindividual it's been going on since the obama administration. They target wealthy white and christian people to destroy them with psychological and electronic warfare, provoke them to attack then seize their property. They are using the Hispanic and black community to attack whites and Christians. It's been done to thousands, if not millions of white people already. The bullying of Nicholas Cruz was gangstalking i think they were targeting him he was a targeted individual. The government made him snap on purpose by using gangstalking.

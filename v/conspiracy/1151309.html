             I suspect they want/need more control
            </p>
            <p>
             I also suspect that the situation is hitting critical mass.
            </p>
            <p>
             The current system is 30 years behind. The soft science kids are worthless in society now. But the stem and business kids are too rational, too independent.
            </p>
            <p>
             So my  hunch is that they will shrink the history, English and other miscellaneous programs down and try to make everyone a stem, business or vocational major.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why? Because we are at the point where we do not have the skills we need for the military or government jobs.

            <p>
             The problem with that program, is the people that they need make twice as much as the pay grades that they are offering.
            </p>
            <p>
             The degree inflation in the US is that bad.

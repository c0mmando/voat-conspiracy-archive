           I use a lot of back channels, first time here in voat. I'm very skeptical of this Q ordeal as it seems like a LARP at times, and I've been weary of any Gov organization/op ever since reading and learning about operation 40. What I want to know, is why is no one talking about ®@©1N€? Why is no one talking about f0X©0nn and all the dirt and muck that stems from that place when you really take a good hard look at it? I heard there were some people who tried to talk about it, especially here but were "taken" care of. I understand the implications of talking about this place too, but at the risk of my own personal safety, the word must get out there. Lots of people of similar interests, mostly ©F® and other dirty organizations work and are based there. If you're really curious, look up that company I just listed. Look up that towns mayor and who that mayor's father was. Look up the geographical significance of that area too. Why it would be so special to thepth@tb€. I would post in a more direct manner, but id imagine this channel is heavily monitored and this post would be immediately flagged. Hopefully some come out to talk about this and give their thoughts.

            It’s a chink company. They take little slanty kids off the street, put them in sweatshops, and make them assemble electronic devices. Quite honestly, there’s

             probably
            </em>
            little to no sexual activity going on there, because sex would make the kids too tired to work their 16 hour shifts.

           <p>
            This is very plausible to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I live in Alberta, Canada and the rcmp here have allowed a gang of serial killers to target prostitutes in Edmonton for over 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are completely complicit in allowing this to continue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Using mason opposite magic they have called their team assigned to hunting these guys "project care" because they really don't.
           </p>
           <p>
            They don't answer their phone, it goes to an answering machine and they don't call you back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their response to the situation is to take DNA samples from all the hookers so they can identify their corpses better. What sort of a message does that send to the victims and the serial killers?!!
           </p>
           <p>
            They are just using the women as pauns in a game.
           </p>
           <p>
            They ignored Robert Pickton in BC until he had killed at least 85 hookers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing the officers at a press conference about "project care" years back they looked and acted like psychopaths themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wouldn't surprise me if these fucks are fully working with the killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are the same guys that have been instrumental in the First Nations genocide here that was recently acknowledged by JT.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are the sickest cunts I have ever had the displeasure to meet in my life.

             Maybe the hookers should find safer employment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hookers and the homeless are easy targets for serial killers, no one cares when they go missing.

             <p>
              Good post .. I am in Brisbane Australia where the same problem exists, it appears that when police and legal ppl identify a suitable killer instead of charging him they use him to commit more crimes on their behalf.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1999 a
              <a href="https://murderpedia.org/male.B/b/brown-arthur-stanley.htm">
               Mister Brown in Townsville
              </a>
              was prosecuted for the August 1970 rape and murder of Judith and Susan Mackay aged five and seven years .. I had been to the police since 1993 re this matter, and had told them a man at work was constant in his boasting that he and no other had committed this crime.
             </p>
             <p>
              Contacting Mr Brown’s solicitor she said that since we do not know the fellow's right name we are unable to proceed, I had told her the name I knew him under at work was the name he used as a professional boxer, which was not his right name.
             </p>
             <p>
              That he admits he and his car were at the crime scene the day the children died, and that he fits the description of a man seen talking to the girls at the school bus stop on the morning of the day they disappeared .. nevertheless she insisted brusquely and with superb woman’s logic she would be unable to proceed further on that point and hung up the phone.
             </p>
             <p>
              When I contacted his barrister in Townsville he pooh poohed it all then he too hung up the phone .. the jury found Mr Brown not guilty after a petrol station attendant who saw the girls in a car crying on the day they disappeared in company with a man who stopped to get fuel, positively stated Mr Brown was not the driver.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I took my allegations to court at the Australian Industrial Commission, telling them thugs of his stamp had been infiltrated into the Painters &amp; Dockers Union and that union members had been murdered, all to terrorize members into abandoning their union affiliation in the interests of political decision to de register unions with less than ten thousand members.
            </p>

             <p>

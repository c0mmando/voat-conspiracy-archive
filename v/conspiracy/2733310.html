            You make good points, although I'll admit I don't have a fucking clue what went down. It's clear that "they" target people who shake the narrative tree. Cody would be top of that list. I support him still, he had consensual sex with an underage prostitute. So fucking what? His bad, but it's not the end of the world.

             They'll crucify him as a pedo in Texas because she was 16 and classify her as a victim.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course in Nevada the age of consent is 16 and prostitution is legal, so it would've been perfectly legal there in the same country.
            </p>

             It's amazing to me that people believe

              this guy
             </a>
             all of a sudden became a complete idiot, dropped all attempts at security, reversed his dogma of complying with the letter of the law and "accidentally" got himself caught with an underage prostitute.
            </p>
            <p>
             It flies in the face of common sense.

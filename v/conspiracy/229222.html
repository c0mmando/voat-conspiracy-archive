<p>Illuminati, as you know, mean the Enlightened ones. It is a broad term for those with a certain understanding of the universe and it\'s content. It includes the principles of our world, our society, and the way we work.</p>
<p>All the knowledge of the deepest aspect of our existence, we have accumulated over the millennia. It has consistently been hidden from the masses - and kept within the ruling classes - the &quot;Elite&quot;.</p>
<p>Those who possessed the knowledge, but were <em>not</em> in the &quot;Elite&quot;, have been systematically silenced. We have been fed propaganda about how &quot;evil&quot; the occult is, and this has forced practitioners into hiding, and even been killed.</p>
<p>The current paradigm is entirely based on occult teachings, and they are not always being used for good deeds, as you all may have noticed.</p>
<p>-So what does that have to do with you? Well - Everything!</p>
<p>Since most of us here know what is happening in the world today, I\'d like to give you a sneak-peek behind the scenes, and how it all operates.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>WHAT IF</strong></p>
<p>everyone learned the occult in school, instead of all the inane bullshit we are forced to regurgitate in the current educational system, the elite would not be able to exist. </p>
<p>-Bold claim, huh?</p>
<p>If these teachings were to become common knowledge today, we would have a new world <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>-We would have our <em>own</em> world order, and not the Elite\'s tyrannical &quot;New World Order&quot; which looms in the horizon, ever closing in on us. </p>
<p>Time is running extremely short as you all know - the next stock market crash has already begun.</p>
<p>So all I can do, is spread the word. </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>THE BASICS</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the laws we have today, are man-made. Above those, are <strong>Natural Law</strong>, and <em>that\'s</em> what they have kept hidden from us for all these generations.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>MARK PASSIO - The de-occultist</strong></p>
<p>I\'d like you to &quot;meet&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bs6sWFvJbU">Mark Passio</a>.</p>
<p>He has a great insight into the occult, the way it works, and how it\'s being used against us. He has worked extensively over the years to put together what I want to put to your attention.</p>
<p>He is an ex-satanist who became a High Priest within the Church of Satan, but quit after he found out what he was really a part of. </p>
<p>To narrow it down, what he discovered, was basically that the entire organization was a pyramid scheme, similar to that of Freemasonry, but it\'s set up and used as a sickle, to search for certain human resources. (Again, similar to Freemasonry, and Skull and Bones and so on.)</p>
<p>If said people performed certain tasks, and had certain world views, they would be allowed certain opportunities, and often progress to some position of power.</p>
<p>These pyramid schemes are known world wide today, and are the basic structure for all aspect of our society - so to get to know them, is <em>essential</em> in this fight we are involved in.</p>
<p>He himself was offered such an opportunity, but turned it down, and now spend his time de-occulting the occult, so that people like you and me can start to fight back this corrupt system.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>THE GOOD STUFF</strong></p>
<p>He has put the story and tools together in several lectures and seminars. The information he has provided for us is invaluable, and I am obligated to share them with you.</p>
<p>First off, an introduction to the occult, called &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1V98DsNXi0">De-mystifying the Occult</a>. It covers the topic extensively, and provides the necessary insight to start climbing the pyramid of knowledge for yourself. This is a 3 part online presentation lasting almost 7 hours, so bring out the popcorn!</p>
<p>Also check out his online seminar (excerpt) on &quot;Natural Law, and the 7 Hermetic principles <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIEemKcy-4E">here</a>&quot;. </p>
<p>(Full seminar for the un-initiated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Bs6sWFvJbU">here</a>).</p>

<p>After I began studying the occult myself, it dawned on me that Adolf Hitler read occult books as well. And he seemingly had a favorite - (Madame) Helena Petrovna Blavatsky\'s <em>The Secret Doctrine</em> (3 vol.).</p>
<p>(I have linked the ebooks here: <a href="http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm">Vol. I and II</a> and <a href="http://www.theosophical.ca/books/SecretDoctrine,The_HPBlavatsky.pdf">Vol. III</a>.</p>
<p>To put it short, consider this:</p>
<p>-If Hitler had these teachings, he must have used the knowledge in his pursuit in order to be able to gather a whole nation (for his own purposes).</p>
<p>-Imagine what <em>we</em> can do with such knowledge!</p>
<p>Occult teachings are easy as hell to get a hold of now-a-days. And you have the tool for the job right in front of you.</p>
<hr />
<p>It sounds bizarre, but we live in the middle of the apocalypse. It is still looming under the scope of most people, but we\'ve reached a point in time where we produce, gather and compose more information in 1 day, than has been accumulated in the last 10 000 years. </p>
<p>-Seize the opportunity to <a href="https://thepiratebay.mn/search/sacred%20texts/0/99/0">download</a> some new information, and begin to fight the fire with fire.</p>
<p>-Know thy enemy, and learn to use their <em>tools</em>.</p>
<p>-<em>Become</em> the &quot;Elite&quot;.</p>
<p>-Become the Illuminati.</p>',

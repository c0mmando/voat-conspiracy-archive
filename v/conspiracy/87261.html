            Well, the CIty Attorney came back on the driver with second-degree murder, manslaughter, second-degree assault, two vehicular manslaughter charges and misconduct in office.  So, looks like they may push for the rough ride.  Maybe they really aren't going to fuck around with this one and really nail these guys.  That would be really nice.  For once.

            Well, it was a rant with some partial truth sprinkled throughout.  They absolutely deserve to have the families of their victims decide their final punishment.  Be it instant death, life long beatings, or just a "go live your life knowing you're a disgusting human being".  It's up to them to decide.
           </p>
           <p>
            My WTF about the investigation, isn't that an investigation is taking place, obviously that's procedure to move towards indictment.  The 1st question is really the only question that needs investigating.  The other two questions are merely present to obfuscate the answer to the 1st.  Clearly, if procedure dictates to belt-in a suspect, and you don't, you have violated procedure.  If procedure dictates you provide medical assistance when needed, and you don't, you have violated procedure.  They already know those procedures were violated and don't need to investigate them for any reason other than to lay the groundwork for whatever bullshit excuse they peddle out to answer question #1 with anything other than "He got a rough ride to the station".

            Good on this kid for going public and setting the record straight.  When the news of his accounts started circulating, it really smelled like they (PD) were trying to paint a picture that Gray did this to himself, which if you know what these sort of vans look like, you would know would be  virtually impossible.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Medical experts said as Gray's condition deteriorated after the injury occurred, he may have suffered seizures.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Earwitness said he heard a little bangning for a few seconds.  A seizure would certainly do just that.
           </p>
           <p>
            What really irks me is this dog &amp; pony show:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The investigation was submitted Thursday to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office. It focuses on a couple of very key questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Is there something that the driver of the police transport van did to cause Gray to slide into the back of the van to somehow injure his head with such force that it snapped his neck and caused that severe spinal cord injury?
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Did the officers do what police are required to do? That is to maintain the care and safety of a prisoner in their custody. They were supposed to belt Gray in securely with a seat belt, but their own lawyer, the police union's lawyer, said that did not happen.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Officers are also required under policy to call for a medic when they think it is necessary or when they think it is requested. The Police Department has already acknowledged that Gray requested medical help two or three times along the 45-minute timeline of his arrest but did not receive it.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
           </blockquote>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              It's called the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_ride_(police_practice)">
               Rough Ride
              </a>
              .  They've been doing it for decades.  That's no damn secret and as a local reporter you know this and are doing a disservice to your readers by not mentioning it as a possibility to account for the medical examiners report.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Dude died in their care.  Did the officers maintain care and safety?... I'm going with a big fat no on that one.  WTF is there to investigate?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              So they know he asked for medical attention.  They know he never received it.  Again, WTF is there to investigate?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Seriously, what is this shit?  What is there to investigate?  Just hang the bastards already.  Don't really hang them, though.  Just strip em down to boxers &amp; tee shirts, put a sign on them that reads "I'm a cop and I killed innocent people" then just drop them off in some of the B-more city neighborhoods.  Problem will right itself, hopefully in a long, drawn-out, painful process.

              I'm not sure which was more depressing when I read that one:  A) The fact that a guy was, most likely drunk, and simply taking a leak, had his neck broken by people sworn to protect. B) The fact that the family lost their husband/father and couldn't even get decent compensation for his murder.  C) The state has enacted a system to ensure financial protection for local districts who hire thugs and murderers.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a side note, I did a little digging into this reward settlement cap, I had never heard of such a thing.  Apparently it's in place for limiting the amount of money people can receive in suing a local government employee.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The cap, which arises from a law enacted in the 1980s, generally limits a local government's payout in a lawsuit to $200,000 per plaintiff or $500,000 for claims connected to a single incident.
              </p>
              <p>
               the city had paid $5.7 million in court judgments and settlements since 2011 for 102 civil suits alleging police brutality and other misconduct
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              There's not even a financial incentive for the city to try and prevent police abuse, so why bother trying?  If you're interested, there's a

            My hope is that this is just another distraction and it will all wind off without anything happening.
            <br/>
            Fortunately, there is no mechanism the US can use to mess with NK like they did with Libya and Ukraine - the only way for the US to enforce their will is through direct combat and that never ends well for anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much of this media beat up is an attempt by chicken hawks like the squealer McCain to make the current president look bad, but he's forgetting all the previous presidents that faced the same issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            If everyone simply left NK alone the situation would resolve itself, and China is well aware of that.
            <br/>
            Which is why China will be officially following the global communities continuing sanctions etc and sending all kinds of resources under the table as a way of rewarding the regime for good behavior. And holding them away for 'bad' behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            Overall the most likely outcome is a few more 'escalations' and some kind of resolution to stop before it passes the tipping point.

            If that were true the US would enter peace talks with a country they've stonewalled for 70 years.

            The US and North Korea are still technically in a state of war - this is one of the longest unofficial cease files in history.

           <p>
            All of the actions going on in that region are that of countries at war with each other, this isn't some dictatorship that arose recently.

            This entire situation was fabricated by the US after WWII, before which the Korean people had been brutalised by the Japanese for many decades, to the point the Japanse attempted to systematically

            But of course that won't happen, as the "North Korea Situation" is a fantastic time to advertise military hardware to a global customer base.

            This entire situation is far more nuanced than the MSM would have you believe and the US is very much at fault for fostering the current situation and perpetuating a situation that otherwise would be resolved.
            <br/>
            All it would take to resolve the situation would be for a representative of the US government to open sit down talks for peace.

            <p>
             What the media failed to mention was that, for the last three weeks, Japan, South Korea and the US have been engaged in large-scale joint-military drills on Hokkaido Island and in South Korea. These needlessly provocative war games are designed to simulate an invasion of North Korea and a "decapitation" operation to remove (Re: Kill) the regime. North Korea's supreme leader, Kim Jong-un has asked the US repeatedly to end these military exercises, but the US has stubbornly refused. The US reserves the right to threaten anyone, anytime and anywhere even right on their doorstep. It's part of what makes the US exceptional.
            </p>
            <p>
             Monday's missile test (which flew over Hokkaido Island) was conducted just hours after the war games ended. The message was clear: The North is not going to be publicly humiliated and slapped around without responding. Rather than show weakness, the North demonstrated that it was prepared to defend itself against foreign aggression. In other words, the test was NOT a "bold and provocative act" (as the media stated) but a modest and well thought-out response by a country that has experienced 64 years of relentless hectoring, sanctions, demonization and saber rattling by Washington. The North responded because the Washington's incitements required a response. End of story.

            Just finding it extremely troubling that the (((MSM))) is painting Kim Jong Un out to be a homicidal mad man, yet we've been on his doorstep threatening to kill him &amp; conducting military exercises training to do so, for months now. Once again, and now under Trump our Military Industrial Complex is engaged in being the World's Police. Might be one thing if they weren't crooked cops who allow shipments of opiates/opioids out of Afghanistan and such but. And once again the most advanced military on the planet is threatening a virtual nobody on the world's stage, a nobody that's nation is probably bordering on starvation due to sanctions.

            If we convince the North Koreans we're going to kill them no matter what they will fight. Which appear to be exactly what we're doing, while the (((media))) keeps up with this unreasonable psychopathic madman narrative about Jim Jong Un. Definitely a conspiracy going on here.

             Whats happening is that we trained a dog to growl when it's hungry. Thanks to the appeasement of bill clinton that sent 2 nuclear reactors and 5 billion in aid in exchange for the dismantling of their nuclear program(didn't happen as you may have guessed).   So for the last 20 years we get the kims throwing a tantrum and we appease that tantrum with food and supplies.

             It's no coincidence that this is happening just as NK is coming out of a very bad harvest. Leading to a famine that is so bad it's effecting even the privileged few.

             Blame the war games all you want it's just short sighted. If kim does nothing his people starve and will eventually depose him.  He's just doing what he was trained to do by our failures in leadership.  He's a toddler throwing a tantrum over a cookie...

            :  "Founding NWA member Ice Cube called him a “devil” in his ’91 solo track No Vaseline and urged his old bandmate Eazy-E, then still in business with Heller, to “put a bullet in his temple".  Also: (((Jerry Heller))) himself saying, “In the rap community I was the White Devil, enemy to the black man,”...  ----

             Eazy-E's death, assassinated during acupuncture
            </a>
            : Rapper Frost, a labelmate on Eazy-E’s Ruthless Records, is similarly unconvinced. In an upcoming documentary, Frost shares, “I’m-a tell you what happened with Eazy getting AIDS and I believe this to this day...And I don’t care if you guys got it on film. You can tell the world. They gave him tainted needles with acupuncture. Needles that tainted him, they gave it to him.” Frost goes on to hint at the alleged murderer's identity, explaining, “I don’t wanna say that name ‘cause it’s the devil’s name—but another person in rap, if you know your history of rap, calls him the devil” before concluding that “how else could somebody die that fast of AIDS? Have you even heard of somebody dying in two weeks of AIDS, bro? Come on, man, it’s just unheard of, bro.”.

            : "The J.D.L. apparently had a habit of threatening rappers that they were targeted for murder, then demanding money in exchange for their protection. Or as the FBI files puts it: "The scheme involves (name redacted) and other subjects making telephonic death threats to the rap star…Subjects then intercede by contacting the victim and offering protection for a fee. The victim and their family are taken to a 'safe haven', usually a private estate, and are protected by gun-toting body guards associated with the Jewish Defense League."  ---

            , “whether the extortionate activities … are in furtherance of the social and/or political goals of the JDL.” They show a scheme in which the League notified the rapper of alleged death threats, then provided “protection services” while working out a “deal” with the supposed threat maker. After receiving money from the musician, the JDL would announce an agreement with the would-be killer, allowing Shakur to return to normal life.".

            : "Heller said, "It was no secret that in the aftermath of the Suge Knight shake down incident where Eazy was forced to sign over Dr. Dre, Michel'le and The D.O.C., that Ruthless was protected by Israeli trained/connected security forces."[65] The FBI documents refer to the JDL death threats and extortion scheme but do not make a direct connection between the group and the 1996 murder of Tupac Shakur."

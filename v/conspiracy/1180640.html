           <p>
            Tonight on my doorstep was a man yelling.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't a scream, only a yell.
           </p>
           <p>
            The property manager was already there. I was just coming to the front office to do some work, and he summoned me out. I had heard the yelling, didn't know where it was coming from.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem was within a man, white haired mullet, ex marine. I had seen him before, always drunk. He would stop at the concierge station and linger too long, too drunk.
           </p>
           <p>
            He used a walking stick, always carried a backpack. His tattoos were of his Apache and Lakota heritage, on his neck, his arms, his fore-arms. His calves were strong like a man of the desert. I learned he was from Oklahoma, lived in Las Vegas after the Marine Corps.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was writhing in post seizure agony on the front steps.
           </p>
           <p>
            I brought him a water and a brochure to bite down on. The ambulance never came. I lit his cigarette, he had an unopened pack of pall-malls.
           </p>
           <p>
            About 10 minutes in he was able to understand where he was. Not piss drunk, but too drunk. He had walked home but he could walk no more, so I helped change his backpack into a pillow while the manager - wanting to put him back onto the streets, called his social worker.
           </p>
           <p>
            When he was coming to, he said "Everything is coming back."
           </p>

             Two Feathers was supposed to be moved today. We did a welfare check on him this morning and seems he never made it home. He hadn't taken his walking stick.

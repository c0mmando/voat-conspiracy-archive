            I clicked on a link somewhere or another to read about the Philly event and found myself on CNN. Didn't mean to and probably wouldn't have clicked had I been paying more attention, but what got me to realize where I had clicked was because of this automatically played super dramatic and low music. It was almost like a track from Resident Evil or Silent Hill or something where something super evil and terrible had happened and you were supposed so just be slack-jawed and in awe of the scene. 
Psyop / Social engineering is in full force.

             If you look at the photos you can see the damage is selective, the graves closest to the path are the oldest but some survive, this is because (((they))) only topple the headstones of graves where there are no living relatives, simple.

              Could also be a message to particular Jews, to remind them of their roots, but you would have to go grave to grave and check names to confirm. Like a rich dissolute Hollywood person's dear moral grandpa who

             True. There's probably no big conspiracy. It's maybe just a few Jews seeing everyone else playing the victim. And they want to remind everyone that the Jews are the biggest victims by committing a false flag attack against themselves.

           There's something that stood out about that clip - the bars show up while the singing is going on, a good half second or so before the bomb sound. Why would the bars be prescient? How would anyone's camera know that this was about to happen? How would we lose
           <em>
            just
           </em>
           the part of the clip where the explosion happened, and not the preamble? In the days of film, we could physically find pieces of film and older footage might be protected from the full destruction by newer footage, but in the digital age, there's no reason why a half-destroyed camera should only retain the
           <em>
            first
           </em>
           part of a data chain and not the rest of it.

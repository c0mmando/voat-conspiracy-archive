            Aliens are any extraterrestrial beings, meaning those not originating or residing on planet earth. There are heavenly and lower (including hellish) planets. The sages and demigods live in the heavenly planets, and dark entities completely opposed to God consciousness live in the lower planets. These dark entities are demoniac and are called asuras. They are focused completely on serving material nature and indulging in sense gratification. They love sexual pleasure. They are usually enemies of God and believe that the world belongs to them, 'might is right' etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            They trouble the devotees of the Lord, and the Lord Sri Krishna descends as incarnations or as Himself in his complete form to give protection and spiritual protection to the devotees and annihilate the miscreant demons. Demons (atheists) will always exist, they think Krishna is just another superpowered living entity and that they can someday through tapasya (penance and austerity) exceed him. Many even succeed in acquiring boons from the demigods such as Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc. but in the end they are always vanquished.
           </p>
           <p>
            The current situation on earth is that we are in Kali Yuga (predictions from indian scriptures on Kali Yuga, very accurate -
            <a href="https://theharekrishnamovement.org/2013/06/05/predictions-for-the-age-of-hypocrisy-kali-yuga/">
             https://theharekrishnamovement.org/2013/06/05/predictions-for-the-age-of-hypocrisy-kali-yuga/
            </a>
            ) and so evil and sin is on the rise. Many demons have incarnated in human form, and others have started influencing planet earth to promote materialism and anti-God-consciousness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earth is a very special planet. Lord Sri Krishna descends in a material universe (there are many material universes, as in billions of them) after a huge amount of time, and lives there for 125 years, displaying his pasttimes so that people may gain knowledge of Him. He chose planet Earth, specifically Vrndavana, India, to advent. So it is an important planet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humans are being influenced so much by the other powers because human life is the most important life a living entity can attain in reincarnation, the reason being that this form of life is specifically mmeant to attain god consciousness so that we can escape the matrix and go back home, back to Godhead (god's abode).

             I've looked into these kinds of things a lot. Become aware of a few things.
            </p>
            <p>
             E.g. That materialism is bunk, consciousness/thought being more powerful and built into the universe, power of belief/prayer/law of attraction. Reincarnation existing. Global cataclysms reducing the visible human technological and scientific level. Suppressed/Hidden/black technology, efficient power sources and efficient motors suppressed, electric universe, tesla. Poisoning all of us and the world with Morgellons, vaccines, fluoride. Illuminati/NWO/Big Jew/Archons/Demiurge.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm trying a few things, sun gazing, meditation, positive thinking. I'm going fine.
But the problem is I don't know how or even if its possible to separate info from disinfo without developing an intuition. This is of course a problem for falling into traps, taking actions that you believe will help you/the-world but will actually just eat your energy or make things worse. But you can't trust claims either way, people claiming that doing something is bad may just want to dissuade that action.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the things I've read/watched even imply that things are fundamentally unknowable. One example was the idea that the big cause of all this mess, Enki/Satan, was an entity that overestimated his power when taking some action against a dark force/area. This caused him and his crew to be traumatized, go insane, split personality etc. With him as the prince of lies, being a fragmented being, he doesn't actually know what he's doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Things get really muddled. e.g. Is what you think is intuition really just them implanting thoughts into your head? There's the idea of predictive programming, is that because of some cosmic law that they must reveal the truth at some level, or is it that by seeding the thought they can use the law of attraction to make it come about. There's the idea that you have to agree to the system at some level for them to be able to do things to you, so you shouldn't vote as that's acknowledging their power, but on surface level that seems like throwing your vote away or accelerationism. There's the idea that positive thinking will cause triumph, but then the idea that this is just to discourage us from taking action. There's the idea that sending love thankfulness forgiveness will help, then there's the idea that this is a trick for the evil entities to get off scot free in some kind of cosmic court. There's the idea that researching what the evil entities are doing to produce countermeasures, and then there's the idea that this is a waste of time as just proper spirit will repel their attempts, and that looking into their future plans may cause them to be more likely to happen through law of attraction.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is so much deception at all levels and so many layers of it that really anything could be true no matter how bizarre absurd or even normal seeming it is. One thing I'm personally I little concerned about is the Lost Time Hypothesis, I haven't looked into any details or whether its reasonable that I could be true in accordance with star alignments etc, just that I know its possible to fake history. Just the idea is concerning to be because if the current known year is wrong, then that throws of astrological events. But I feel like something did happen around 2012, because otherwise there wouldn't be all this awakening going on, probably.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what are your suggestions for attaining truth/methods. Thanks

              Thank you for taking the time to reply. You go into a lot so I'll handle it point by point.

              Reincarnation does exist, so does the law of karma and the cycle of births and deaths is supported by the law of karma only. A spirit soul has to enjoy or suffer the results of their pious or impious deeds. Even if one has done lots of charity, never hurt another being etc. they are still trapped and forced to take birth again to enjoy the results of their good karma. So the only way to break this material bondage is to act in krishna consciousness, wherein one gives up the results of their activities, whether good or bad, unto Lord Sri Krishna and he takes charge of dispensing the results. It doesn't mean that if you do something bad you won't be punished, but that the punishment will be beneficial to your advancing in krishna consciousness. It is called inaction in action. Here is a good article about it -
              <a href="https://krishna.org/what-is-action-and-what-is-inaction/">
               https://krishna.org/what-is-action-and-what-is-inaction/

             <p>
              Hidden technology does exist, and technological progress is deliberately suppressed so that humans are kept in a state of distress constantly. Many diseases are artificially introduced into human society and then the cure is marketed and money is made. The living entities conditioned by material nature have 4 defects - 1. Imperfect senses 2. Fall into illusion and delusion easily 3. Commit mistakes 4. Cheating propensity. So this cheating propensity affects all of us and we all have it, to a greater or lesser extent. These defects don't exist in the inhabitants of the spiritual universe. Also, there exists three kinds of material miseries, those of the body and mind, those caused by other living entities, and those caused by natural disasters and other such calamities. So this material world will always be an unhappy place. It is a prison house, or a teaching camp, not a vacation resort.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do not try positive thinking. I mean, you should be actively pessimisstic and that will keep guide you well through this world of miseries and dangers at every step of the way. -

              There is a lot of disinfo in the form of mayavadi (impersonalism) and shunyavadi (voidism) philosophies. Research what they are. Ask me. Don't fall for them. Read Srila Prabhupada's books to redpill yourself.

              There is no evil creator, the universe is run exactly according to God's will. Here is how creation takes place -

              True intuition is listening to the Supersoul, the Parmatma in the form of Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, who guides us and acts as our spiritual master from within. However, unless we take to the practice of Yoga (not stretching exercises on a yoga mat, but a very rigorous and ancient Hindu practice) we can't distinguish the mind's chatter from true guidance. I'm not sure if they implant thoughts but I wouldn't be surprised if they do. They don't need to however, because already we are so materially contaminated through brainwashing, media programming, bad habits, false philosophies etc. that most of our thoughts are a drain on our consciousness and a circle of uselessness.
             </p>
             <p>
              New Age, the Secret, and Law of Attraction is a lie and doesn't work (I'm assuming you mean something other than simple motivational thinking). Why is it propogated? -
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9kvb9l/the_gnostics_were_the_original_christians_who_got/e72woee?context=7">

             <p>
              I'm not sure if we should vote but I don't see the usefulness since most government leaders are corrupt robbers and plunderers of the public's wealth. Also, the public doesn't have the judgement needed to decide who is a good leader and whose policies are correct.
             </p>
             <p>
              Forgiveness is good. At our neophyte stage, we can't forgive a person completely anyway, we aren't advanced in prema-bhakti, or true love, and that good quality of forgiveness is just not strong enough in us. So any efforts to forgive will only reduce our material bondage, and practice developing that quality, which is good. It won't let them off scott free because karma isn't decided by us, it is decided by the Lord and our forgivness probably lessens their punishment, but doesn't erase it. I'm still unclear about the specific workings of karma since Srila Prabhupada focuses on destroying it and so doesn't teach exclusively about its mechanisms. Still, what he taught about it was enough.
             </p>
             <p>
              Researching to evil entities and being aware of their dark activities is helpful, since it equips us to avoid their strategies or, as you said, develop countermeasures. The law of attraction is a lie.
             </p>
             <p>

               Of course, man is endowed with free will, and as such if he does not want to free himself from the material world he may enjoy the life of brahma-pada (occupation of the post of Brahmā) and visit Siddhaloka, the planets of materially perfect beings, who have full capacities to control gravity, space and time. To visit these higher planets in the material universe, one need not give up his mind and intelligence (finer matter), but need only give up grosser matter (the material body).

            So refering to nephilim and other such... what would you like to say here, heavenly?... beings as aliens is wrong or incorrect. That's your stance isn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            So are they from earth or did they somehow arrive on earth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is god from earth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the devil and his demon ilk from earth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are all of these entities foreign to planet earth?
           </p>
           <p>
            Would that not make them "extra terrestrial" then?

              Extra in this context literally means outside of. And terrestrial of course means of Terra, or of Earth. So it literally means outside of Earth.
             </p>
             <p>
              So again, are these beings of Earth or not of Earth? I realize English is a complex language but even a child can figure this one out. Is English not your first language? Do you not possess a dictionary or access to the internet? Perhaps you simply lack basic reading comprehension skills. Are you maybe functionally illiterate?

               The fallen angels gave up on their heavenly nonphysical bodies( well they could manifest in the physical as well)..  But their dna is different.  Their offspring with the earthly women are the nephilim.  Theyre born in this world, growing tall as cedars( in those times ppl lived 500 yrs plus).  The bible says that the reason for the flood is because there was NO GOOD left on earth.   Understand what that means.   These nephilim corrupted the planet.  They had NO GOOD in their conscience.  That means they were purely evil.   Watch the video i linked.   It talks about all the different ctures, mayans, egytians, etc, with their myths, all myths point back to the times of Nimrod in Babylon,   and all myths refer to powerful 'gods', and the 'war of the titans' is referring to the nephilim fighting each other, and in the book of enoch it says that afterwards the nephilim turned on their fellow humans and started eating them.   The flood was for a reason.   Go ahead doubt all these things.  But then do a little historical research and look into the ruins of the temple of solomon, and then go ahead and refute the freemasons and their starting place.

               Who knows...
I've looked into this myself and I think the main point is that calling them aliens downplays the spiritual/metaphysical aspects of these entities.
Aliens is technically true even if hypothetically outer space is an illusion and these beings come from some kind of "higher realms" instead. That they're hiding their true nature yet again behind a limited hangout.
              </p>
              <p>
               The basic reason for this is that in a material universe where matter reigns supreme, obviously a technological superior force can squash it's inferiors like ants.
              </p>
              <p>
               But if thought and consciousness is the primary force of the universe, then at least at some level resistance is possible.

              If you want to put a different perspective on it:
             </p>
             <p>
              Satan owns this planet
             </p>
             <p>
              God is alien to this planet
             </p>
             <p>
              God is coming = we're gonna have an alien invasion
             </p>
             <p>
              All the satanics on the planet are shitting pants because to (((them))) God is the bad guy.

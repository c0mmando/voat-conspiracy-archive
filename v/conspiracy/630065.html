            I would not be surprised if there was (or even still is) a program dedicated to discrediting conspiracy theorists, with the obviously crazy ones actually being government agents (either directly, or manipulated); so that when people hear about real conspiracies they don't take it serious...

            Double edged sword. By using 4chan, you can just throw the information straight out there. At the same time, it gives haters ammunition to say "oh it's from 4 chan FAKE".

            I don't know. I'm Italian, so what I do know is how the "5 stars movement" was started by activists following a politically active comedian who was heavily ostracized by both the government's and private TVs and media in general for saying politicians were thieves (in fact they were all arrested a few years later).
           </p>
           <p>
            As soon as the 5SM started, the media ignored them. There was a large event in a large city with hundred of thousand of people, and it barely made the news. Then, when the political elections were getting close a few years later, pollsters gave them no more than 15% while the media started talking about them a little more but only in a dismissing way: they're ignorant, they're ridicule, they're populists, they have no chances.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the election happens. 25%. A little less than the first, biggest Italian party. They fucking
            <em>
             panicked
            </em>
            . Not only the media was going batshit crazy about the movement, all of the sudden, but politicians had to play against the law to ri-elect the previous President (against the spirit of the Constitution) and ally with each other no matter if they pretended to fight for years, Democrats vs Republicans style; of course it's always been a fraud because as soon as they felt threatened they put down the masks (something that IMO would happen happen in the US too if only a third party could actually get that close to winning).
           </p>
           <p>
            Then a year of hostile media happens. Now they're not only incompetent and silly, they're fascists, xenophobic, racists, conspiracy theorists, homophobic, mysogynists, potential rapists, nazis and communists; if you think I'm exaggerating, those are the exact words used against them by the media and politicians. The barrage of insults was so strong that the movement lost traction for a while, also because they were refusing to go on TV like any other politician always did, so journalists and politicians were already celebrating their narrow escape, they said the "populists" were not here to stay.
           </p>
           <p>
            After that horrible year, they start going on TV while the other parties are hit multiple times by investigations and arrests, not only the usual mix of theft and fraud, but mafia; the Capital itself is stormed by an inquiry showing how most of the administration is in bed with a right-wing terrorist mafia started by an old gang of robbers and killers. The media hit the leading parties as little as they could but the pile of shit was so big they just couldn't ignore it, while the 5SM not only comes out of it completely clean, but one of his mayors was said to be "incorruptible" by the leader of the whole gang (his phones were tapped).
           </p>
           <p>
            The results are polls heavily punishing the leading parties and giving the 5SM even an higher result than the first, lucky elections. Now that the mayor or Rome was forced to resign for completely unrelated trivial matters (a clear sign our democracy is a joke), everyone says they could even win the Capital.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know what will happen but what I see is "elites" being completely incapable of stopping it. This is not like Greece or Spain, everybody knew both Syriza and Podemos were pro-EU and that they would have bend the knee as soon as they would get any position of power.

            Not at all.

            Having a child means having stable income. Stable income means being part of the rat race, and feeding in to the current system. Finding a way to legally live outside of typical 9-5 jobs is difficult. Raising a child is expensive. Extremely expensive.
           </p>
           <p>
            How about schooling? Do you expect me to homeschool my kid? Because they sure as hell are going to be brainwashed- or attempted to be -in public schools. Should I move? Oh, well now I have to buy a house or rent an apartment, uplift my life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why don't YOU think about the question for a bit?

            So you're telling me Cold War never actually ended. It's more of the same, old shit, just with more powerful propaganda and tactical weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since actual grass movements disconnected from the elite are getting more and more traction in the western world, I wonder what would happen if one of those would get in power, the country doesn't even matter. It never really happened before so we can't predict their reaction, and I think it would be quite important to know since the only thing that could redeem democracy is someone who isn't in bed with generals, banks and corporations.

            I knew it was all about maintaining the petrodollar, since it allows them to print assets.

           <p>
            But damn, that bit about the Arab spring being completely contrived by Western Governments, and how that relates to the internet kill switch, shocking.
           </p>
           <p>
            And wow, gamergate. When I first heard about it, all I could think is, duh. The government pays Hollywood directors for propaganda, why not game developers? But the scary part is how they've managed to manipulate all these SJWs into unwittingly supporting propaganda and censorship, all of it to accomplish a very abstract financial foreign policy goal.

            On the bright side, if the elites don't blow us all up in the next 20 years or so, those anti-ballistic missile defense systems might be good enough by then to render nuclear weapons obsolete.

            It's a fair assessment of various factors, much of it supposition, and it omits many players who are watching the shitshow from the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity to profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you add in the various 'climate accords' being drafted by the EU (cuck central) to the Identity Politics you can gather a better understanding of the tools being used to produce the desired result (ie: familial protection for the 'elite').
           </p>
           <p>
            Anytime the media as a whole present a unified message (one they all transmit as being true) is precisely when you should question it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The narrative of gamergate that the media presents should be the candle that illuminates the other programs of propaganda being pushed.

            <p>
             It is through no fault of our own, our parents have failed us and we are placed in the checkmate position today, without prospects of work, without even a bright future to look forward to. Perhaps without even life. But there is still hope and it lies in our children. We will likely not see a bright future, no matter what we do, but we must cleanse ourselves of the selfishness that has driven our parents and us to the point we live in today. Rid yourself of nihilism and remember that no matter what happens in the end, if we protect, entertain and educate our children, who are our precious future, however long it takes, our children or their children, will one day taste freedom.

              I second that. The text had me all the way up until the last paragraph or so. Children cost so much money that only the wealthy can adequately raise them to the point the last few paragraphs are describing. But that is counter to the points the author made about the generation being poor and jobless. I feel like the author went to all that trouble with the setup and then just quickly pinned the last few paragraphs together. I think it far more useful to disconnect from the system and 'not play the game'. They need us to make all of that work for them.

              Are you childfree or something? Countries with weak family ties inevitably turn to liberalism, to hatred of their own people, and to self destruction. America has gone down hill since the legalization and acceptance of divorce.

             Darth Sidious, Empereror Palpatine, is a representation of the inevitability of liberal democracy failing and becoming a fascist state. There's an interesting commentary about the Jedi, basically the religious and militaristic branches of the galactic government, being blind to the dark forces running the political sphere.
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT: George Lucas was asked in 1981 if the Emperor used to be a Jedi and he basically replied "No, he was a politician. Richard M. Nixon was his name."

            edit: okay, okay. i stand corrected. that was worth it.  When i get kids, theyre getting homeschooled.  in the meantime, how do we fight back? is there a way to stop common core?

             TL;DR is actually one of the memes/tools enacted to reduce the ability of the common population to critically asses new information.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every time you feel/think "this is too long, I want a shorter, easier to understand version" you have demonstrated the effectiveness of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every time you search for a TL:DR, fight it and force yourself to commit the time.
             <br/>
             Those that want to subjugate you have committed the time, why aren't' you?

               TL:DR is basically the bully at school who says "your read? what are you some kind of smart person!" not understanding that by implication they have called themselves some kind of dumb person.
              </p>
              <p>
               It falls under the rubric of 'question authority, always', as we give the writer of the TL:DR unquestioning authority by assuming their interpretation to be correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               Which is why it is always a good idea to question, seek more information and consider facts when forming an opinion.

                  Don't distribute it out of your own printer nor any printer that could be linked to you, and burn it before you throw it away; they got this almost invisible code they print that uniquely identify which printer was used, and possibly some more info.

               seriously though, this is worth reading and it's not badly written.  it would take a you a long time to research all of this and come to some very similar understandings.

             USA needs to keep destabilizing other countries to prop up it's dollar. Russia and China have caught on to this and are not taking their shit any longer. So in the coming years they will very slowly as to not disrupt their own economies move away from the dollar while shutting down the US in all their endeavors in the middle east. US will keep distracting people with inner problems like SJWs instead of global problems that are actually important to keep people stupid and docile.

             Teach your kids about Nationalism and warn them about the dangers of Liberalism and Globalism. Don't let them watch television or become brainwashed by the elites currently in power. Teach them to understand and value the 1st and 2nd Amendments. Teach them critical thinking. Teach them about the people in control of banking and the media. Keep them pure. Give them something to believe in.

               Us versus them has worked for millennia. Humans are different genetically and culturally and will never integrate as a single species. Multiculturalism is a lie. The government functions efficiently when it focuses on advancing the needs of all members of a single race and culture. Socialism breaks down when it tries to treat everyone as equals. Each nation should focus on advancing their own race and culture within their own borders. People of other races should be allowed to visit, but not be granted equal status and rights as citizens of a nation. Each race advances their own race. Jews push multiculturalism as a way to weaken nations and gain power.

                People are perfectly able of doing well together, even across different cultures. We only start having problems when bigotry is allowed to be seen as acceptable.

                For example; if instead of being treated as slaves, blacks were brought willingly to America, given all the same rights, opportunities etc as any other human, not treated as if they were inferior and so on; there wouldn't be such a huge stratification of the economical classes, each individual would've been able to achieve their full potential, the proportions of different races would be much more evenly distributed on each economic class. And since people would've been treated properly and given a way to be able to do well, the poorest wouldn't be as poor as they are today; and without the richer people seeing the poor as "the others", relations would be much better, with much less conflicts and much more opportunities for people to go up.

                    And btw, genetic diversity is actually good for the species; so by inbreeding you're actually making your kids have a bigger chance of dying when a new disease comes around; "race purity" makes things worse for the population.

                       My shit is fine. I blame Jews for pushing multiculturalism via the media in an attempt to gain power and control. Niggers are just pawns for the Jews. They are too stupid to realize that they are being used and they get free shit out of the deal. I will stand up for and defend my race and point out when Jews are attempting to destroy us.

                        Perhaps there is a language barrier issue here. Didn't you read it when I explained how bigots like you are what make things not go well? Multiculturalism is a good thing; idiots like you who instead of cooperating to make things better, fight against your fellow humans are what makes the world be in such a bad condition.

                        The reason poor people, regardless of race or culture, not only remain poor but get poorer, no matter how hard they try, and therefore need assistance in order to have even a minimum of decency in ther living conditions; is because assholes like you placed them there and took away their chances of doing better.

                          You know that if you're not 100% black, you're a mix of homo sapiens and Neanderthals, right?

                          And the stuff about animals not showing kindness to other species is also bullshit; I've seen many instances of it myself, and there are many more you can find online.

                           The  Neanderthal DNA is probably what gives whites their distinct advantage. The average IQ of Africans is between 75-80. The only thing that can increase that is by mixing with white, jewish, or asian DNA. It definitely provides an advantage for blacks. But, it ruins the other races. That's the part that the Jews are counting on. They want to destroy all races to make the world an easier place for them to control. (By the way, Jews have a very high IQ as a result of keeping their bloodlines pure and eliminating the lower-end of the spectrum).  You should investigate how well Israel embraces multiculturalism:

                            Test the IQ of black people that grew with access to proper education, no lack of money, no prejudice etc, and grew up in one of the cultures that the IQ test was designed for; and then you can come back and talk about IQs. The results from the IQ test is just a number, it doesn't say anything about any factors that could influence the ability of the individual to take that specific test.

                             The children of wealthy black parents with advanced degrees score below poor whites on the SAT and the LSAT. Only 61% of blacks pass their state's bar exam on the first try, whereas the passing rate for whites is 91%. Only 58% of blacks pass Step 1 of the US Medical Licensing Exam on the first try, whereas the passing rate for whites is 93%.

                              These score gaps could be interpreted as white admixture tests. White students have SAT score advantages over all non-Asian minorities. The gaps shrink in order from African Americans to Hispanic Americans to Native Americans to “other” race students. This order seems to correspond to white admixture (African Americans: 22%, Hispanic Americans: 48%, Native American: 50-60%). Granted, those admixture estimates are debatable, and I am reluctant to draw strident conclusions related to the small, fluctuating number of students who call themselves Native-American on the SAT, let alone “others.”

                              Of all group differences, the best studied is between whites and blacks. The black-white gap is also the most reproducible, the black mean lagging behind the white by about one standard deviation. Consequently, we can estimate the black distribution by shifting the white distribution to the left by 1.0 SD, as in Figure 2. When we do this, the area representing the failing fraction increases to 0.75. That is, if whites fail at the rate of 37 percent, a black-white gap of 1.0 SD implies that blacks will fail at the rate of 75 percent, in agreement with their observed failure rate in Waco. Thus, the Waco school district results for blacks and whites were consistent with standardized test results observed universally. (Details of the calculation are given in Appendix A.)

                              Does any of that ensures the only difference is race? There is a lot of factors that can affect your ability to score well academically; including stuff in your past , the way the test is designed, who rates the answers etc.

                              mentions a variety of correlations; but keep in mind, correlation does not necessarily means causation. For example, if students are told by an authority figure that people with blue eyes are dumber, the students with blue eyes will have a harder time doing well on a test; this has nothing to do with eye color, they performed worse because of what the authority figure said, it's a known effect on human psychology.

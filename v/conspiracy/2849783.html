<blockquote>
<p>The Archons are the beings who created this lower, material realm of existence, according to the Gnostics. Their leader, Yaldabaoth, is the same as Jehovah or Yahweh of the Bible. The Church Father, Irenaeus, records in his work Against Heresies that the Gnostics believed that Yaldabaoth had made a pact with the bloodline of Abraham. The pact was simply this: if the descendants of Abraham would worship and obey Yaldabaoth, then this Chief Archon would give them dominion over the entire world and all the other races of humanity upon it.</p>
<p>You will recognize this pact as the covenant which the Jews believe they have with the being they call God. The Jews believe themselves to be God\'s Chosen People. In return for worshipping God in the way God specified to them, God would reward them with rule over all the other peoples of the world. This is why Jewish rabbis regard non-Jews as equivalent to cattle. They believe that they own us, just as they believe that God gave them Judea and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This God of the Jews is the same being who trapped Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and kept them in ignorance of their true power and nobility. The true God sent the Serpent of Wisdom into the Garden to give Adam knowledge, and thus free him from his ignorance. In response, Yaldabaoth was enraged and drove Adam and Eve out of the Garden.</p>
<p>Yaldabaoth is God the Father of the Bible, but he is not a good god, nor is he the true highest God of All. He merely believes himself to be the supreme God in his arrogance and ignorance. He rules over the realm of the Earth (that is, material reality) which he created, but he does not rule over mankind, because the true highest God sent a spark of his divinity into every human being, and as a consequence human beings are actually higher and more noble than the Chief Archon who created their bodies of flesh -- but they are asleep and in ignorance of their true estate. The act of gnosis is the awakening of a human being to his own potential, as a spiritual being. Once awakened, as Jesus was awakened, a man or a woman is more powerful and greater than Yaldabaoth or the lesser Archons who continue to preside over our material realm.</p>
<p>It is in the interests of Yaldabaoth and the other Archons that mankind remain in a state of partial ignorance. We are not as ignorant as Adam and Eve in the Garden, but we have not yet awakened to full gnosis of our true heritage as spiritual beings whose dwelling places are in the stars. The Archons wish to keep us in ignorance, and for this purpose they employ various tricks to distract and ensnare us in physical passions such as lust, hatred, envy, jealousy, and so on. They rely on their agents, the Jews, for this purpose. The Jews work to keep humanity in ignorance of its true estate, and thus weak and easily manipulated. This role is a part of their covenant with Yaldabaoth. In reward, they are set up as rulers over us in this debased, material plane of existence. In essence, the Jews are the demons who run hell, and their god is Satan. This is true in a very real sense, it is not just a metaphor. The Jews are serving Yaldabaoth by corrupting the rest of mankind, and their reward is rule over mankind.</p>

            The interesting thing is you don't have to directly observe these things to see that something is manipulating humanity.

            Too many weird coincidences stack up. Franz Ferdinand's license plate matches WW1 Armistice day.

            The fact that our government is most likely being run by pedos is a good indicator. When has the government EVER done ANYTHING in your favor? You can see them flashing Freemason gang signs all the time too. Above all they don't look right.

            It's worth considering that nearly everything we're told in school is a lie. In spite of man's supposedly great knowledge we're sicker than ever, our technology is getting more unreliable, we know nothing of the outside world. People claim we have "space" figured out but our models fundamentally do not work. The "expanding rate of the universe" has not been modeled with matching values and we keep finding celestial objects that shouldn't exist according to our models.

<p>Posting this around in hopes that someone can help me. Please forgive me for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>I desperately need to contact the site owners / voat.co admins but I don\'t know how to reach them, or even file a report on the anonymous shills who are doing this.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3675488">https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3675488</a></p>
<p>I just watched my points go from 120 to 70 in like 2 minutes.</p>
<p>It\'s an extremely serious issue that there is absolutely no way to tell who upvoated or downvoated anyone. I can\'t even check my own account or settings and see who it was. They\'re able to hide in total anonymity and launch a huge amount of downvoats at my account that I don\'t deserve and censor me with a click of their mouse. voat.co should get an update that makes who voated on who 100% transparent. You should also be able to block people who excessively downvoat you on a consistent basis, so that they are no longer able to downvoat your account. As it stands, I don\'t know how to block whoever keeps downvoating me every single day.</p>
<p>I\'m sure that every single day some shills get together and use 100% of their available downvoats (or use bots) to find old posts of mine from several days back and just downvoat any post that is able to be downvoated. I dedicate 100% of my time here on voat to dropping redpills and spreading the truth and awareness, and I believe this is why they target my account.</p>
<p>There is no way to defend yourself against floods of rage mobs of shills with an agenda, all working together to censor accounts that don\'t align with their political agenda by downvoating them regardless of the quality of their content. If you support Trump, Q, America, you\'re a target to them. It\'s absolutely disgusting how this is simply allowed to happen. How can a site grow and even maintain a level of posters if everyone is driven away by a mafia of downvoat mob shills faster than they can join?</p>
<p>Q research is reality- NOT A GAME. Yet this site is set up like a rigged and loaded game. You have to earn points by getting others to judge your post content as high quality. You have to have points in order to have the <strong>privilege</strong> to comment, or voat, but shills and trolls downvoat you to take all your points away so that you can no longer do these things, so it\'s circular and broken logic. It\'s completely illogical actually. No free speech. Kid\'s stuff. This is insane, we are better than reddit. This broken and flawed and exploited system has to change because this is not REAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH. It does not matter if you post good quality content, if you are a conservative, they downvoat all your points away either by stalking every single post and thread you make, or by using an army of weaponized bot accounts to do it for them. Once they know you\'re a conservative, magically all your posts you make on any and all boards start to get downvoated one by one until their all in the deep negatives. This system is grossly corrupt and rotten and rigged. The thing is, I get plenty of upvoats from legitimate people who truly love and appreciate my posts, but even their upvoats are not enough and every time I make it up to a certain amount of points, I suddenly lose a large amount of points again without any warning or reason.</p>
<p>Let me make myself clear, I don\'t really care about points at all. I don\'t like the fact that points are directly tied to your ability to post. If you don\'t have enough, you can\'t do as much as if you do. Why are you even able to lose points after you have gained them already? This is like the social credit score of communist china.</p>
<p>points shouldn\'t limit your ability to post, and furthermore if this is the wild west, as some have supposedly claimed Putt himself said voat is, others shouldn\'t be able to limit others ability to speak. That\'s what moderators are for if someone does something seriously screwed up. Since points are literally in the hands of other people, including people who are very very willing to abuse them, you effectively give everyone a bottle of censorship spray that they can just spam everyone with.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no system of checks and balances to prevent this abuse of the point system, and the censorship of anyone being targetted by organized downvoating efforts by insidious shills with political agendas.</p>
<p>Please someone reach out to the voat admins, I need to talk to them somehow. Please even just show them this thread. I believe the shills specifically wait until they see me posting online again to launch their downvoat attack so that they know that I watched my points drop a massive amount, because I think they intentionally do it as what they believe to be a demoralization tactic, a psychological warfare tactic to make me give up and stop calling out the shills and spreading serious redpill material. They\'re this desperate to shut me down, but hear me: I WILL NOT GIVE UP. GOD BLESS AMERICA. GOD BLESS Q. GOD BLESS TRUMP. GOD BLESS AMERICA!</p>
<p>THIS IS SPARTA!!</p>

             So how does he prevent illegal activity if he's gone? shouldn't this person be watching their own website? What even happens when a report is filed? Does it literally go nowhere at all? What's stopping criminals from abusing the supposed complete and total absence of the website owner? This is insane. Just awful. There's a difference between Freedom of speech and total bloody anarchy. This place is just awful. On reddit the moderators censor you for telling the truth, and yet here, you're just as censored by shills who are probably best friends, probably reach-around fuck-buddies with those very same satanic globalist censorship loving moderators from reddit.

             literally every single website that has any capacity for free speech tends to be this way. I only wish they would step in and do something to save us, or this website will probably just become a ghost town like all the other chans before it. The shills work for the deep state, which wants to disrupt and destroy and generally make a shithole out of any place with freedom of speech so that nobody can simply talk about how they love trump/q/america, because just being free, and thinking free, is a huge offense to the deep state. They do this to every single free speech website without any mercy. God help us.

             All shills have to do is organize a bunch of sock puppet accounts and bots and just downvoat nuke the hell out of anyone they want to censor until they can't post anymore. I call that pretty fucking restricted.

              The good goats sortby New periodically. They try to shill the site, but the content quantity is too low to hide much nefarious activity. I suspect, in regards to your illegal activity point, that this site is literally run by intelligence agencies now. They just keep it going and say absolutely nothing while they gather data. Overall, this is just another place to vent and spread truth for me. Occassionally I pan out a truth nugget from the turds and go on a learning binge. You can call people niggerfaggots here. You're a niggerfaggot, dumpster diving, bastard son of a Mexican taco stand operator.

               really not surprising if true, but I wish they would take a break and help a fellow american out with these shills, which they must know are here causing trouble and trying to stop the truth from getting out. Good parts of the CIA, FBI, if you're watching, can you maybe arrest some shills and send them to guanhanalabingbongboobmama-tanimo-bay for a few decades? shills are literally information-terrorists, so that means something to them.

                I think some goats have gone missing over time. I do wonder how many "goats" have been arrested. Obviously some have changed handles. I, for instance, used to be ScalarWhaler before I forgot my password.

                 Unless you're being targeted by shills... You probably never told the truth in a way that made them angry or something. I'm not disrespecting you, I'm just saying whatever I said really ruined their day enough to want to censor me.

             That's really low, shitting on someone who's asking for help and has a genuine problem. Way to gang up on the person who's already being ganged up on. You're nothing but a coward, and God rebukes you and frowns upon your dirty rotten soul.

               hey there, you seem to not have read a single thing I mentioned in my thread. I don't actually care about points. I'm pointing out that shills are organizing their efforts and mass downvoating specific accounts they don't like to censor them. One of the points I'm making is that points shouldn't be connected to an accounts ability to post, because points and voats are abused and that is counter intuitive to freedom of speech.
              </p>
              <p>
               You probably ignored everything I said and made up a bunch of delusional bullshit and accused me of being a shill because you're actually a shill. blocked.

            Power attracts sociopaths in a democracy.  That in and of itself shouldn't be remarkable.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is remarkable though is how so many people just look the other way.  There are so many examples of this, but this one is particularly galling because of how obvious it is.

            George Bush paid Ayatollah Khomeini around $24 million dollars to keep holding the hostages until Jimmy Carter was defeated.  Bush thought he would be the next POTUS, but Reagan (at that time considered a joke candidate like Trump) came out of nowhere and beat him out of the Republican nomination.

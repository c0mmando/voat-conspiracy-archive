            Well, I guess that you're calling me, my father, about 10,000 people on the Internet, and the entire A&amp;E for 9/11 Truth staff "liars" eh? That's cool. It must have been a worldwide mass delusion. I know! Perhaps an offshoot of MK-ULTRA aerosolized some weird analogue of LSD and sprayed it all over the US, Germany, France, Spain, and Argentina...all countries where people SAW this program and stepped forward to say what they saw/heard. Wow, those CIA goons!
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't seem to remember what tech was like in 2003, do you? I do...I owned my own ISP then (the 3rd largest in the DC regional area) and digitizing television was no easy/cheap task. It WAS likely copied somewhere...but on either film or videotape. Curiously, the largest video archival service in the US (the National Archives) has
            <em>
             every other episode
            </em>
            save for this one. Now...why is that?
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, you never got back to me on the injections! Are you going to take my $200? If so, why not? Hypocrite? Shill?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no time to argue with idiots with psychological issues. Have a good life and enjoy your self-delusional world.

            I'm an utter history geek and I watched it. I heard it with my own ears as did my father--who believed the "official (lie) story" until then. It was also heard by hundreds of people throughout the world--some of them made YT videos describing what they heard. A cursory search of YT will reveal MANY other people who saw the episode and remember the quote--most verbatim.Take a look.
           </p>
           <p>
            My TV was CONTINUOUSLY tuned to the History Channel back when it was good and not taken over by shows about gay men screwing old hillbillies out of their prized possessions, redneck hot-rod builders, and alligator wrestlers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that the largest video archival service is government-owned. The National Archives, curiously, have EVERY episode of *History's Business" save S2E5. Now WHY would that be?

            I wish that were true. Unfortunately, it is a blatant mistruth, and shows how little you do, in fact, know about video recording in the early-2000s in general...and
            <em>
             History's Business
            </em>
            in particular.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, it DID appear on YouTube for a few hours before being removed for a "copyright violation." Back then, with limited home-computing power, ripping a video directly from videotape (or a live feed) was reserved for the owners of Hauppage cards, which were very pricey at the time and required a huge (for the day) amount of RAM to even approach frame-grabbing at a rate over 6fps.
           </p>
           <p>
            DVRs didn't really exist yet...except for the TiVo--which, at that time, could only hold a bare minimum of shows...about 12 hours at the most--although they claimed that it could hold 14. Remember that is was standard-def also...higher def programming and programming that utilized SAP used far more data. This resulted in programming material being "recycled" over and over again...unlike, say, a Hopper of today, it was nearly impossible to hold onto anything for more than a few days...unless you wanted to record nearly nothing. "Binge watching" of DVRed shows was still twelve years-or-so down the road.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trust me, it DID exist. I watched it. My Dad watched it. THOUSANDS of people watched it and reported on it. We even have an exact episode, season, and an approximate time (in the show) of the quote. It was a VERY memorable quote and to suggest that thousands of people around the world simply experienced a mass hallucination, all at once, without being in contact with each other positively reeks of idiocy and delusions of grandeur.
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of being part of the problem, why not try to be part of the solution? It was said that it was impossible to fit a computer into a space less than the size of a large room...but along came Shockley with the transistor and proved the "experts" incorrect. My point is...it IS out there somewhere, it DOES exist. All it's going to take is a friend of a friend of a ReddactIt/Voat subscriber who works at an archiving agency to find it...and to get it out before somebody in authority realizes the explosive nature of what their employee has just dug up.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you wanted to (which you don't) you'd have the chance to play the part of Shockley here. Luckily, as I said, there are likely thousands of people scouring the world's film archives for this episode...and it WILL be found. Matter of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's people like you, and ridiculously obvious shill comments like yours, that played a large part in enticing me to leave ReddactIt behind forever. At least your username is memorable, and has been noted in my database until we have something like VES to work with.

            I just wrote A&amp;E for 9/11 Truth a letter telling them that a $200 "reward" was simply laughable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since I KNOW that this episode of
            <em>
             History's Business
            </em>
            existed (yes, I heard, with my own ears in RT, "Lucky Larry" claim that WTC7 was a controlled demo) I find it VERY strange that it is now completely unavailable. I remember that it existed on YouTube for a very brief moment...like a day. I wanted to rip the video but, at the time, I didn't have the computing power nor the connection to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I suggested to the folks at AE9/11T was to crowdsource the discovery of this episode...and to crowdfund it. Including the money that I'd put in (and the comments from others on ReddactIt) they are looking at an over-$10,000 "reward" for the person who finds this video. I think that's a whole lot more "compelling" than a paltry $200. It's like they don't want it to be found!
           </p>
           <p>
            I also found it very strange that the 9/11 "truthers" didn't jump on this but, let's be honest here, "History's Business" was on early Sunday mornings, it was boring, and not many people watched it. DVRs were in their infancy, relatively. The ones who did ALL seem to remember "Lucky Larry" and his infamous quote confirming that WTC7 was, indeed, demolished by design. There is no possible way to set cutting charges, set radio detonators, run det cord, insure that the charges are placed firmly against 47 massive core columns, etc, etc...all in less than seven hours. It simply is not possible to do on a scale that large.
           </p>
           <p>
            This means that the explosives were in place before the events of the morning of 9/11 took place (just like the FEMA command center interestingly enough--and the "dancing Israelis" with their set-up-and-running cameras)...and that begs the question--"If indeed WTC7 was destroyed in a CD, which Silverstein clearly said it was, what ELSE were we lied about regarding the events of that day?"
           </p>
           <p>
            We now know the answer to that: we were lied to about EVERYTHING. The question basically comes down to this: did the Bush administration orchestrate the event, or simply allow it to happen? Cui bono? Who stood to profit the most...above everyone else?
           </p>
           <p>
            When the money is followed, as it is in Chris Bollyn's groundbreaking free book
            <em>
             9/11--The Deception That Changed the World
            </em>
            , it's very clear what the answer to this question is. Throw in the testimony of the Jewish man from the Gomel Chesed Cemetery (who saw and heard a high-level Israeli meeting take place--and tried repeatedly to tell the FBI about what he heard only to be ignored) and the identity of the perpetrators couldn't be clearer. This was the work of a fixed-frame intelligence service and was, likely, 20-30 years in the making. There was a ton of predictive programming going on in the decade that led up to 9/11/2001--mostly all from Hollywood (which, as Agent Jones is quick to tell you, is COMPLETELY owned and taken over by the ARABS of course!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Connect the dots and it all falls into line. Bollyn's book of pure facts, all with voluminous citations, does quite an admirable job of doing exactly that.

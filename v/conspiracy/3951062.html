<p>We all know the Covid is a hoax, that a person or group of persons is perpetuating the entire thing to try to expand big govt and keep all of us hard working Americans trapped inside our homes. I\'m proud to say I go out without a mask every day because I\'m not afraid to show my face and stand up to big govt.</p>
<p>It still bothers me that we know someone is making up Covid, and that whoever it is knows how to cover themselves so well. Then a facebook friend I grew up with (who unfortunately turned into a textbook liberal) posted something completely outrageous, but it got me to thinking. The post in question:</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, Trump wants to delay the election because his fefes are hurt. Blatant faascism much?&quot;</p>
<p>I was prepared to go over to his house and slam his face in because I\'d had enough of his liberal bullshit, but that word made me remember something from 3 years ago. I feel like I need to re-emphasize that: 3. YEARS. AGO. A little tweet that I had almost completely forgotten about, but looking back on it made me realize how obvious it was. I\'m sure everyone else will remember this tweet too:</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the constant negative press covfefe&quot;</p>
<p>That damn &quot;covfefe&quot;. At the time I thought he was just trying to say &quot;coverage&quot;, because that would perfectly fit - the liberal media has never been kind to our President, giving him all sorts of unfair coverage and representation. It made sense at the time, but what if instead of complaining, he was giving them a warning, a fair notice of what he would unleash if they didn\'t stop?</p>
<p>What if he meant to say &quot;covid&quot; instead of &quot;covfefe&quot;? What if, three years ago, he planned to create an artificial catastrophe to get the left all riled up and worried so that they would stay home until they became so desperate and tense that they felt they had to start rioting and destroying public property around the country?</p>
<p>Think about it - Trump gets a bad rep from the liberal media, but he\'s smart and he knows how they work; he knows what they like to see and how they like to blow things out of proportion. And so instead of trying to fight them head-on, he takes the smart route and decides to make them destroy their own credibility by giving them a piece of fake news so big that when he finally reveals it, they have no choice but to eat crow publicly and admit that he was right all along.</p>
<p>And so he lets something &quot;slip&quot;, he plants a seed of misinformation that seems innocuous at the time, hidden in plain sight. He wants the liberal media to think he\'s just complaning about them, he wants to play the part to lure them in, and he does it perfectly with a word that he can call up later to prove that he was right all along: &quot;covfefe&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the constant negative press covfefe&quot;. What\'s another way to say &quot;despite&quot;? You could also say &quot;in spite of&quot;, so we get &quot;In spite of the constant negative press covfefe&quot;. Now we can start to see that it\'s more direct, that he\'s not just being the bigger man and ignoring what the liberal media say in their lies about him, he\'s taking the fight to them to spite them and give them a taste of their own medicine. If you then assume that he\'s going after the negative press, that\'s it\'s own phrase, so we need a comma after it before we get to the important word, &quot;covfefe&quot;, so now the whole phrase we have is &quot;In spite of the constant negative press, covfefe&quot;.</p>
<p>But remember, we assume that &quot;covfefe&quot; is a cleverly placed typo, something deliberate to throw the liberals off his scent and make them think he just meant to write &quot;coverage&quot;. But if we assume he\'s smart enough to know that, that he\'s hiding the real meaning of his words from them while letting us know that he won\'t take their bull sitting down, then we can also assume that he already knew about Covid long before people like Fauci and the rest of the liberal agenda ever even heard the word Covid.</p>
<p>So we know the true meaning of &quot;Despite the constant negative press covfefe&quot; is actually &quot;In spite of the constant negative press, Covid.&quot; We know that Trump has been playing the liberal media this whole time, and that it really is a giant hoax to get them to admit that they\'ve been lying about him all this time. Its all been part of his plan to expose the hypocrisy in liberal media, and he\'s been working on it for over 3 years.</p>
<p>But what I still can\'t figure out is what the next part of the plan is.</p>',

           "Despite the constant negative press covfefe". What's another way to say "despite"? You could also say "in spite of", so we get "In spite of the constant negative press covfefe". Now we can start to see that it's more direct, that he's not just being the bigger man and ignoring what the liberal media say in their lies about him, he's taking the fight to them to spite them and give them a taste of their own medicine. If you then assume that he's going after the negative press, that's it's own phrase, so we need a comma after it before we get to the important word, "covfefe", so now the whole phrase we have is "In spite of the constant negative press, covfefe".

           But remember, we assume that "covfefe" is a cleverly placed typo, something deliberate to throw the liberals off his scent and make them think he just meant to write "coverage". But if we assume he's smart enough to know that, that he's hiding the real meaning of his words from them while letting us know that he won't take their bull sitting down, then we can also assume that he already knew about Covid long before people like Fauci and the rest of the liberal agenda ever even heard the word Covid.

            This is the most retarded rambling analysis I've ever read. You're fixated on a 3 year old typo. That's all it was. So he was warning us about covid? Really? Is that why he's going right along with the plan? Signing stimulus money printing bills that will cause hyperinflation down the road? Operation warp speed to get everyone vaccinated in record time? The mental gymnastics of plan-trusting true believers never ceases to amaze.

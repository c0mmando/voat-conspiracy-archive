            Actually it was the British that fucked up by promising it to the Arabs but then giving it to the Jews. However you're talking about the incredibly complex issue of the whether the Israeli state ought to exist or not or what the ultimate solution the quagmire is going to be. This however is non sequitur to the current argument which your assertion that the Arab spring and the sebesquent fall out of that was part a greater Zionist conspiracy to destabilize the middle east: An argument that can not be possibly true due to the fact that the Arab spring has obviously weakened rather than strengthened the position of Jews in general and the state of Israel particular via the empowerment of Islamic radicals in the region and internationally, even if it is true that it has also undermined states with a history of sponsoring terrorism like Syria. IS potentially is a greater threat to Israel than Hamas and Hezbollah put together if IS are able to achieve their current goals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically you're losing the argument so in an attempt to win you're trying to re-contextualize it to being about something else.

            I don't know maybe by having an Islamic superstate park right next door? or undermining their allies with refugees who they rely on for military and economic  support? But I'm repeating myself.

            Oh you mean that plan that has probably done more to contribute to the creation of a Islamic superstate via the removal of most military strongmen in the region - like Gaddafi, Saddam and Mubarak - that might have been able to contain radical Islam? And the same one that has lead to Europe getting overrun with immigrates of combat aged people that hate Jews and would just love to shoot up a synagogue? via the resulting Syrian civil war.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah it's all part of a Jewish conspiracy. Christ you're so far up your asshole I'd swear if they set off a nuke in Tel Aviv you'd think it was a part of the Zionist conspiracy.

            It's simple reasoning: If it's true that Jews have that much control over central banks, corporations or the media then why would they be using these same things to undermine their own agendas? ether via the promotion of left wing ideologies or undermining the power of western countries. It doesn't make sense. Especially when they depend on these countries for the defense of Israel? It's like punching yourself in the face. Surely there interest would be in promoting the west and promoting capitalist ideals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Europe is currently getting overrun with immigrates of combat aged people that hate their guts and want to wipe Jews off the face of the earth. As well as the real possibility of an Islamic superstate forming in the middle east. This combined with the fact that most of the military strong men in the region that were able of containing radical Islam are now gone. If there's a Zionist conspiracy then they're doing a real shit job at running it.

            Thanks. I think there has been an effort to forestall legitimate criticisms on several fronts, so that when people do break through that wall of brainwashing it's all CoonTown or /pol/: Tourette's-like venting with a plausible deniability of "humor". I'd say it extends even further into the "it's just a prank, bro" videos.

            Bullshit. You don't make a better world by making everyone poor. Who would pay for the welfare in that case? lol
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are European richer than anyone else? It's because we could make use of what was available to us. We're intelligent and have creativity. We imagine something, we can make it reality. That's why technology comes from European countries (including north America).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Africans have the richest land on earth, full of natural resources. They should be rich, but instead, they're niggers. They literally sat on their asses and ate bats for thousands of years, they never even invented the wheel or agriculture. They never had the ability to profit from their natural resources and thus they are poor. And honestly, look at Rhodesia; they wouldn't be able to use the riches anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are blaming white people because they are better than the other races on this planet. And you can't help yourself to apply that insane marxist rhetoric to justify your self hatred.
           </p>
           <hr/>

            The genocide is the low reproduction rate being the justification for an enormous flow of immigration from people who don't give a single shit about your history, your values and your culture, while you being encouraged to miscegenate. Also, think about all the reasons why the reproduction rate is low....
            <strong>
             Germany won't exist in a hundred years.
            </strong>
            Do you want to gamble on this or do you hate yourself so much that you want to let it happen?
           </p>
           <p>
            BTW, since you are German, do not blame yourself about your history. You live under an occupation government (technically, it is still the United States) and I see that they've been hard at work making sure you hate yourself. There's a reason why they wanted a war with your country (it's documented), never forget that. Sadly, I cannot link you to source as I don't want to give any justification to your tyranical state to persecute you further.

            Because it directly affects me. During the great depression, when a man had a job he could feed his family. Nowadays, you need two salaries and an insane amount of debt. People can't get out of poverty because the jobs they could have moved to third world countries. It's even worse when you consider that
            <em>
             your
            </em>
            government won't listen to anybody who beg them to reverse those destructive decisions. And what's the endgame for that, well, just ask Soros and David Rockefeller... There's nothing good for us in this.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for white genocide, I dare you to check the definition of
            <em>
             genocide
            </em>
            . If the monetary model requires the extinction of the original people, maybe it is not a good model, don't you think?

            What's wrong with that? The society I live in has been build by my ancestors, for them and their mores. If you bring in a ton of foreigners, that's bound to shake the foundations of this society and bring conflicts or worse. That's why xenophobia isn't a bad thing. Remember, without xenophobia you'd be dead as your immune system fights invaders all the time.

            Blacks are inferior to almost everyone else, nationalism isn't a bad thing and the bad reputation of the jews is really, really well deserved. Gays, lesbian, trans, etc are mentally ill.

            I have thought about this and I think that you're just full of shit. If you were to say Zionists control the banking system in order to oppress communism that would be one thing, or alternatively on the other side of the coin that Zionists came up with communism to suppress free-market capitalism that would be another.  Then you're argument would at least make sense. But here you're just arguing for completely contradictory things and apparently believing in them both.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like what sensible fucking Jew is going to want the country filled with young men of military age with such ingrained hatred towards their own race they would probably love the idea of shooting up a synagogue. Yet apparently Jews are the ones that are supposed to be promoting this situation? Pull the other one. Added to that is the fact, that even if you accept that Jews are all lib-tards that theses same people also hate faggots and are deeply religious as well, just as nice little bonus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah I'm sure they attacked the World Trade Center on 9/11 due to New York's high proportion of people of an Irish decent. Or that must have just part of the grand Jewish conspiracy to fuck themselves and the institutions they apparently control like wall street and the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            What a load of crap. If this is a conspiracy they're doing a real fucked up job of running it, that's for sure.

             Serious question, and I hope you understand the context. In some of the race-baiting threads (think
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Niggers">
              /v/Niggers
             </a>
             ), there's a lot of "national IQ" reports. China and Japan always do slightly better than Europe. What is this? Is this some belief that if the poster admits he's not the top race, then the post is more likely true? Or is there a real admiration for China (I've seen Han specifically referenced)?
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you aware of what I'm talking about? I've lived there... I'm surprised people would hold this opinion.

              Puzzling, isn't it? I don't see anything that indicate that the
numbers are distrusted. So, what could explain the difference between
eastern Asian and Europeans? There are no studies on the subject, and
honestly, I don't expect one anytime soon as it is politically
incorrect and it would be a career suicide for the researchers.
             </p>
             <p>
              I did hear about the idea that Europeans have more imagination, which
I did mention in one of my replies, saying "we imagine something and
we make it reality". From my observation, there seem to be some truth
to this. The world has adopted our technologies, political ideas and
culture. East Asians, don't really bring anything new to the table but
rather improve on our inventions. I also see that in computing: Asians
are good at using stuff we invented.
             </p>
             <p>
              But honestly, I'm not really a
              <em>
               supremacist
              </em>
              , I'm more interested in
making sure that we stop hating ourselves. We should be proud of what
our ancestors left us and build on that instead of tearing everything
down.

                  I questioned him in his own thread and he avoided it. He is a fuckin liar and im surprised he even posts to his own site anymore after admitting himself the site doesn't "work" for what it was intended for (without clueing exactly what it was intended for). He avoids any topic that is discussing the reality of this site therefore he is a pussy and so is anyone sticking up for him.

                   I'm not too surprised he didn't respond. He doesn't too often. I'd hazard a guess it's because his inbox is generally flooded with mail and shit gets passed over.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'm not entirely sure what his initial ideas for the site were. But I know for a fact that it wasn't intended to be a safe place or bastion of hate speech. I kind of feel bad for the guy in that aspect.

                   As for your last comment, You've been here two fucking months. You haven't gotten a chance to witness the amount of flak and vial hatred that bloke had put up with. And to call the man that gives you a platform to be a despicable little cunt, a pussy? Well why don't you just fucking leave then?

                    I've actually been here longer than you. Any bullshit about Atko is fake sympathy garnered to distract from how the fuck this site was capable of operating to begin with considering the waves of users that hit the place(highly volatile demographic). Use your fucking brain, retard.

                    He has had plenty of opportunity to address one of the dozens of shitty problems caused by kikes and SRS homosexuals here yet never did a thing and let them run amuck with their ability to alter literally all content on the site. He clearly doesn't give a fuck about this site so why the fuck should anyone care about whatever bullshit spills out of his mind through his keyboard.

                              If you killed youself people would probably have saw it comin so i think the mourning would be basically virtue signaling. i'm willing to bet no one is going to miss you for long ;)

                                 You know, with how often you bring up gay shit. I honestly would be surprised if you wernt projecting. Is that it? You secretly want a hard cock pounding your ads? But you're just too ashamed to admit it?

                                It's like Omar Marteen in club Pulse. It's obvious when you are in an AIDS playground. The way you typed that though, lol. Wow what a faggot. Those types of degenerate thoughts is why no one is gonna miss you, fool.

                                           It's okay to be gay man. Why don't you and your secret butt buddy move to Vermont? They're much more accepting there and you'll be a much happier person.

                                              I'm convinced gays have a defect in their brain that gives them the feeling that its 100% possible for anyone to be gay.

                                             Like I hate pop idols and shit. But I never fucking talk about them. You claim to hate gays but literally everything that comes out of your mouth is about gays.

So, the first comeback i get from faggots is usually im a closet gay, followed by i must have been molested as a child. It's literally the same shit every time with you mentally retarded degenerates.

                                                       Your musical tastes are also abysmal. You seem to be under the impression that bands like korn, Tim mcgraw and the Dixie chicks are the pinnacle of musical talent.

            Some of us, including myself, find Jew obsession rather tarded. I don't usually downvote though. Maybe you should ask yourselves why this is first rather than assume another Jewish conspiracy to downvote. Though I guess the JIDF could be here. I have no idea. But the tendency to immediately jump to the big conspiracy theory is why many of us find this stuff idiotic.

              Some Jewish group that organizes on social media to counter anti-Semitism.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only times I ever see them mentioned is by anti-Semites who accuse people who disagree with them of being Jews. Some may be Jews but the accusation is made without evidence. Another reason why these types should be regarded as kooks.

            Fuck off with your bullshit, that's your answer for everything isn't it, either they're a Jew or some pet Goy. And no matter how slowly and patiently you go over the historical evidence to dare suggest you might be talking crap, you'll still insist that Jewish/Zionist bankers engineered the Holocaust, which didn’t kill that many people anyway, simply to justify Israel’s something-something-something anti-Semitism. Or some bullshit like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't it occur to you that even if you're charitable towards the evidence. That is, pretend you're not utter talking crap, cheery picking crap, or holding things that discredit your argument to impossibly high standards - like I dunno,

             actual filmed footage
            </a>
            - but ignoring the holes in your own evidence. Even then these arguments still simply make no fucking sense, for example even if Zionists secretly control central banks then why the fuck would their end goal be Communism which is a form of government that would effectively nullify their power. Surely their interest would be in promoting free market capitalism. It's illogical in the same way as to why it's illogical a trade federation would create a blockade to limit trade in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.

             And btw, Jews invented communism in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, David Brooks,  a Jewish political analyst that works for the New York Times wrote an article called "The chosen getting in"  where he fully admits that Jews have supplanted the Anglo Saxon elites and now control America.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it's conspiracy when a Gentile says it, but gets published in the New York Times when a Jew says it?
            </p>
            <p>
             We know that Jews own the media and central banks and are the people pushing multiculturalism and Leftism on Western civilization.  Everything has been admitted and is well documented.

              Right I'll accept all that crap as being true. Why in the fuck would they be actively promoting Leftism on Western civilization if all it's going to undermine their own position? That is by undermining the very institutions that they apparently control already, like the government, central banks or the media. Do you not see how this doesn't make any fucking sense? This is like a tyrant willingly putting themselves to the guillotine in order to promote a revolution against themselves.

                You're failing to address the obvious contradiction of you're argument: If like you say Jews love Communism why would they then be in control of the same institutions that they are apparently against, like the government or the banks or corporations etc? It would be like punching yourself in the balls.

                  The first paragraph of
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">
                   the Wikipedia article on Communism
                  </a>
                  states: "In political and social sciences, communism (from Latin communis, "common, universal") is a social, political, and economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is the establishment of the communist society, which is a socioeconomic order structured upon the common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money, and the state."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Soviet Union had one central bank called the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosbank">
                   Gosbank
                  </a>
                  which was heavily under state control. Also they didn't really have corporations but rather
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprises_in_the_Soviet_Union">
                   cooperatives or state run enterprises.
                  </a>
                  . As a thought experiment if there was to be a communist revolution tomorrow like that of the Soviet Union then it is likely that central bankers would be the first against the wall with all their assets seized and redistributed among the people. I don't see any of the Rothschilds being too keen on that prospect, somehow.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OK, If we're being charitable you could argue that there are differing forms of communism that ought not be lumped together with what happened in the Soviet Union - or whether what was practiced in the Soviet Union was really communism at all. But even then there still seem to be clear contradictions present to that of communism and the interests of central bankers that you can't really ignore. So even if you argued that the Soviet Union was closer to being a dictatorship even then if you're a central banker then you're probably still not going to be interested in that state of affairs much either due to the fact that it's likely that whoever has the power is simply going raid your house in the middle the night and murder you just to nick all your stuff. Which probably has some historical precedent somewhere. Yeah I suppose you could suck up to whatever regime is in power but it seems obvious to me that if you have any wealth then your interest would be more into cynically limiting how much power a regime has lest they get around to coming after you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If it is about collectivizing power - to the point of essentially becoming a part of the regime - and not money then what would be the fucking point?  Who wants to be in charge of some system slowly eating itself when your energy would be better spent just figuring ways to skim off wealth.

                   " If it is about collectivizing power - to the point of essentially becoming a part of the regime - and not money then what would be the fucking point? Who wants to be in charge of some system slowly eating itself when your energy would be better spent just figuring ways to skim off wealth."

                   That is what it's about. Some will argue that communism is  basically Judaism put into modern political form.  The Jews don't care about wealth. They print it.  They want power.  They want to rule over us.  Communism is a more totalitarian form of government. It's a system of government that will give them more control over the people than current Western modes of government will permit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Why let the West decline under a communist government?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Because Israel is their country.  They want Israel to prosper and the West to decline.  They don't care about the West. They basically just want to control a bunch of impoverished peasants.  Poor people are easier to rule over.

                   <p>
                    "They want power. They want to rule over us." Why, like seriously why?

                   <p>
                    Who the hell wants to rule over a bunch of peasants? All they're ever going to do is get unhappy with their lot and revolt. In fact they're arguably harder control because they actually have stuff to lose, so there is nothing holding them back.  If you just wanted to run a failed state there are plenty of those in Africa already. There is literally no motivation for this by itself. If their interest is power and not money then their welcome to run the fucking show, 'cause you couldn't do a worse job, in these places. Surely the better thing to do is to cynically put yourself in a postilion where you're making massive amounts of money because you literally are the bank. And in such a situation you would what to be involved with a successful country due to the fact that there would be more money to skim. The last possible thing you would want is to have a revolution or a dictatorship that is going to potentially fuck with that arrangement. I would argue that this is what Judaism is about rather that any notions of having power just because. This notion that you want power just for the sake of having power just doesn't make sense.

                   <p>
                    Also, If they wanted the West to decline because of Israel then who is going to defend them from the billion plus Muslims who all want to see them wiped off the face of the earth?

                      Hypothetically speaking: Would you go to work for free even if you're the boss and got to order people around? That would be fun for a bit but then after a while would anyone still continue to do this for free without having any benefit to themselves? Sure some might like having the feeling of authority or continue for some ideological reasons but after awhile most people will eventually want to get paid or otherwise use this position to advance their own agenda somehow. Added to this would be the responsibility to keep this shared delusion going as long as possible otherwise having to deal with the prospect of it falling apart with could potentially get you executed. Power isn't really a top down thing when you think about it but rather organic in nature. That is Caesar is only Caesar because everyone around him believes this to be so, and if he doesn't do his job well enough there are more than enough people willing to knife him in the back. What you have are corrupt institutions built upon nepotism and self interest with idiots looking to fuck each other over at the first opportunity, If you want to be racist then I suppose you could say that Jews simply excel in this environment.

                     <p>
                      Also Israel makes use of a lot of American equipment, controls a tiny area of land and has an infinitesimal population in comparison to the Arab world. While their military punches above their weight for sure the fact remains that if the US and Europe were to stop existing tomorrow then they would get wiped off the face of the earth in a heartbeat just through sheer weight of numbers. Due to being completely surrounded by enemies. And If you're arguing that they're able to protect themselves then you're in effect defeating your own argument because then they would have no interest in what would happen in other countries.

                 I'm showing you sourced fact that proves that Jews love communism.  I'm not fabricating information. This isn't my opinion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 78% of Jews vote left.  That's a fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why?  That's speculation. I can't give you a factual answer as to why.  I can obviously speculate, but that's not proof.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So who knows why 78% of Jews vote Left. Obviously they do it for beneficial reasons though.

               Fact is,  there is no conspiracy because it's all admitted.
              </p>
              <p>
               David Brooks is a Jewish political analyst that works for the New York Times and he published an article called " The chosen getting in"  where he fully admits that Jews have supplanted the Anglo Saxon elites and now control America

                  WhiteWraithe? really..  So jewish people being successful somehow equates to your mind as a conspiracy.
Newsflash racists: Culture matters. The same reason the blacks represent a significant percentage of crime, Their trashy "gangster" culture,
Is the same reason Jews are so successful, and influential. jewish children are educated far better, from an earlier age, and the
culture values education over nearly everything else. There is a rich Talmudic tradition, and this is why they are considered the smartest demographic.
It is not a conspiracy, as a conspiracy implies a conscious effort among individuals, to work together to a certain end.

                   The point is that they're the ones controlling society and that's why it's going to shit. It's all by design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   A bunch of nonwhite Jews are ruling over  a White Christian nation. That's why America is anti-White and anti Christian all of a sudden.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Our elites a nonwhite, non-Chriatians.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   78% of Jews vote left. So 78% of all those influential people I just showed you are the people pushing the Leftist agenda on us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Now fuck off.  Everybody knows that Jews control Western civilization and seek to collapse it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They've admitted it.

            Incorrect.  Reality is the way things are, or at least the common perception. Most people are on the same page,  so the most common perception of reality is reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I do not believe reality is subjective.  If my carpet is blue nothing is going to change that.  Maybe to some people ( colorblind)  but that's just their flawed perception.
           </p>
           <p>
            Common perception is reality.  Common perception is based upon common logic which is derived from common sense.

            People aren't all as unique as you think they are.

             If I'll just chime in here I don't think that you quite understand how logic works. Just saying that something is logical doesn't automatically mean it is true. A lot of ambiguity comes down if you attempt to redact things to purely logical terms but in so doing remove it from outsides its context as a result, for example what exactly would the square root of Tuesday be?
            </p>
            <p>
             Facts don't arise from logic but rather logic acts as a validation of evidence. And, if you go in with faulty evidence to begin with, like some belief as the world being flat, it doesn't matter how logical your arguments are you're still going to be wrong due to having began with faulty evidence. That is if you were to say the logic dictates that the world is flat you wouldn't really get that far.
            </p>
            <p>
             To tie this back to your comment when you said that "the most common perception of reality is reality." Well you see, that's a tautology, that's the equivalent of saying that the color of blue is blue, that is you've just shrugged off the problem with something that sort of sounds insightful but actually doesn't really make that much sense if you actually sit down and think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's like you see the problem with position yourself when you relate to someone being colorblind not being able to see the color blue but then dismiss this as being their problem. But then what are you trying to say? that someone who is color blind can't do math because they lack a common perception of reality and therefore lack basic logic skills as a result?
            </p>
            <p>
             It doesn't make sense.

              ' Facts don't arise from logic but rather logic acts as a validation of evidence."
             </p>
             <p>
              Evidence becomes factual once it has been validated. Validating information requires the use of logic.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're basically saying that logic isn't the basis for reality because some people can have faulty logic, and therefore their perception of reality would be faulty as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the difference between sound logic and faulty logic.
             </p>
             <p>
              The thing is,  perception is not reality, but for all practical purposes it may as well be.
             </p>
             <p>
              The most commonly shared perception is reality. Common perception is the result of common sense and common reasoning.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like what is reality?  Is reality perception?  Yes, but whose?  The only way to define reality is common perception.

               Look logic is an abstraction from reality in the same way that mathematics is. When you say something is logical you say that it is geometrically true in the same way that it's true that a thing might be parallel to another thing, etc. You don't go around saying things like because 1 + 1 = 2 that there are 2 bunnies over there.

                You can't compare logic to math.  Logic requires parameters which are relative. Math is universal.

                Maybe I'm the uninformed one right now.. I'm not claiming to be right.  I'm just telling you what I think.

               <p>
                Explain how math is like logic.  I'm not saying it isn't, I just want to understand what you're saying a bit better.

            Listen.  Reality is what it is. To see things for what they are is logic. Facts are pieces of information that correspond to reality.  Just because everybody has their own perception of reality doesn't mean that all facts are subjective.

            No, there is this thing called " logic"  which will lead you to something called a " logical conclusion".  Sourced fact can be a video, which is something easily observed with ones own eyes.

            Yeah for these two posts I think it is a combination of the parentheses and then posting the same post twice in a row. The only information that is unfriendly to Israel and gets downvoted is when Amalek goes on a spamming session, at least from what I notice. I think people on Voat have a healthy skepticism of the Israeli gov and Mossad.
           </p>
           <p>
            I often receive a couple of downvotes in threads discussing 9/11 and Israeli involvement, but certainly not quarantined.

            No I don't. I think people that can't absorb sourced fact or think independently should be put into education camps... I mean fun camps.

            No, people that brigade sourced fact are shills. Submissions about Israel get a half dozen downvotes within the first minute of them being posted.  It doesn't matter the source or topic.  Anything that mentions Israel in a bad light is automatically and indiscriminately downvoted.

             So why are you attacking a useful meme that can show things are not as they seem at face value. Tribalist 'synagogue of Satan' influence masked as globalism is pervasive.  Why are you trying to hide the wizard.

              I'm not attacking anything. OP wondered why there were downvoats without comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              My suggestion is that this is not a useful meme. In fact, I'd say few memes are useful because they're reductionist and exclusionary. They're funny for your friends, sure. If you look through my posting history, I've even tried to make a joke with the parentheses. However, they're not winning any arguments or rallying a cause. Which would you rather do: change the world or swap jokes with people you'll never meet? My last few years around "forbidden" speech has convinced me that -- right now -- it's the latter.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll grant you the "tribalist", but you done goofed on the "Synagogue of Satan".
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Guy_Carr#The_conspiracy_of_the_Synagogue_of_Satan">
               That's Carr's anti-Papist slam
              </a>
              . So, you'd like to promote the parentheses, but you've been kept ignorant of your own history? I might go round and round with you about whether the tribalism preceded the globalism, or vice-versa, but then I'd like to think we're on the same page. I mean, I basically had that conversation earlier this morning.
             </p>
             <p>
              I like "hide the wizard" but I assure you I'm not. You're free not to believe that. I would suggest that any attempt to pull back the veil on the Frankfort School would further your ends
              <em>
               much
              </em>
              more than defending the parentheses.

             Jewish names are not always easy to spot, hard to pick up a pattern. But if someone sources a pro-refugee organization and ((())) is around every name, that has a big impact on the reader.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as helping with the struggle, unfortunate fact is that we need regular people to see these patterns. The methods of showing these patterns may be annoying to you, but they have utility.

             I downvote anything with parens, regardless of the content.  It's stupid and annoying.

            <p>
             Also, if I read by New, which I do often, and there's fifty fucking posts in a row crying about censorship, they all get downvotes.  Make your case in one thread, please.

              I'm a little ashamed how much the SJW mentality has expanded to the right, with the endless butthurt of censorship. I think there's a strong case that our educational system / Frankfort School has undermined rhetoric in an attempt to resurrect a political tower of Babel. In contrast, very little is done to coordinate how right wingers should discuss among themselves and the face they should present to outsiders.

              The parentheses are just part of it. Someone took offense, so some people believe it must be used. Sly plan to win adherents to your ideology: I'll offend people into letting me speak! They're a bunch of Aryan Embarrassments shooting themselves in the foot. If the success of the Zionist conspiracy depends more on the short-sightedness of the Goy than the craftiness of Hebe... who can blame them?

            I hope they got some justice, but even without it, i hope they were able to recover and experience joy afterwards.

            2 shots at the dog, two misses... someone needs eye glasses.  Then tripping and continue shooting.  He needs another profession, one not involving guns or authority.

            Edit add: Has anyone found what breed the dog was?  Just curious.

            This is why you never ever ever call the cops. They are never on your side. They are on their own side and can do whatever the fuck they want with no repercussions.

            Wait so the dog wasn't near the officer, or was the officer grappling on the ground? If the dog was not near the officer, there is clearly no immediate harm. Even if the dog is attacking him the officer could

             Ok, this is like saying, "Why didn't the cops shoot the guy running at them with a knife in the legs???" Cops aren't super highly trained individuals who can curve bullets and shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said, I'm not taking either side until all the evidence comes out. From that shaky ass video, I couldn't even tell where the dog was. Was the dog behind the fence? If so, that cop is retarded.

               Have you ever fired a pistol? They're accurate to about 10 meters, and that's if you're just trying to even hit the target and you're actually aiming. Given the .5 second time this officer had in the video to react to the possible threat from the dog, there's no way he had time to make a well aimed shot.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, I'm not taking the officer's side here because I can't tell what the fuck is going on in the video. To me, it looks like the dog is behind a fence, but I have no clue. If the dog was contained behind the fence, then there should've been no reason for him to unholster his gun, and he should be charged with some sort of criminal negligent homicide.
              </p>
              <p>
               Wait until all the evidence is out before passing judgement.

                Good point. Why shoot if you cant hit. If the dog is coming fast and close you may not even have time to unholster your gun though thats not the case here. Imo, officers should be trained to take down a charging dog. Sure if you fuck it up you might get bit but you wont be killing what is potentially someones lifelong friend. Some of these dogs could even be support dogs prescribed to treat some level of mental illness.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its a shitty situation all around but there are just too many cops killing peoples pets. Thats why if a person ever has to call the cops they need to put there dog jn a cage or at least locked in a room where the officer wont feel threatened by seeing it.

                   I'm just saying, when working with police dogs, they go over it again and again, DO NOT DO THIS, YOU WILL BREAK THE DOG. Maybe it's just ingrained in officers to not do that move, and shoot instead. I haven't had a ton of training with police dogs, so if they ever send a dog after me, I'm not running, I'm going to fuck that dog up. If you run, the dog has the upper hand. There's no way in hell you're going to outrun that dog, and by giving him your back, you can't see where he is when he attacks.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You know in all those police dog training videos, they show the guy in the bite suit pulling away from the dog? Well that's your natural instinct, to pull away. What you do is, when that dog comes to bite, jam your arm as far into its mouth as you can. The faster that dog is coming at you, the more it'll fuck 'em up. Sure, you'll get hurt some, but you've got a better chance of fucking up that dog if you stay and fight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As I've said over and over though, isn't the dog behind the fence? I can't even tell. I'm not taking sides until all the evidence is in the open.

                    I was going to reply further down but Ill just reply here. I agree, pistols are really inaccurate (especially in tense and fast-moving  situations), which is why i'm wondering why the cop tried to shoot at such a small target that is also running (or maybe standing still because the video is pretty much useless).  And why was the cop apparently on his back/why was the camera pointing towards the sky, and how do we know if the cop was shooting the dog? the camera points to the sky and there are two shots, the cop might as well have been shooting at the woman for all we know (except we know she was shot), and even then the police are not trained to shoot police dogs, they are probably trained how to subdue them so as to not kill them.

                    this article has more information and says the cop lost his balance and fired at the dog, one bullet hitting the dog and one hitting steele, but still he might as well have just kicked or punched the dog, or even landed on it because he weighs probably four times as much.

                   Well you wouldn't want to fuck up the police dogs, would you? So they basically told us how to get bit by a dog without hurting the police dog, you know, doing the bite suit training. If you hit a dog coming to bite you a certain way, it'll break their jaw.

             This is a thought prompted by your comment, so no research:
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe they are trained regarding dogs, police dogs only.  They have been shown what a dog can do, and it is nasty, so...  all dogs are evil now in their minds.

            Antifa related protests have to date not targeted any humans. Fascism disregards human dignity and safety and antifa is against fascism. Notable exceptions are from nutty fringe white people and are widely disavowed by leftists. However, look at the institutions that come closest to disrupting human life and safety, as in, effective terror that forces a cultural / behavioral change in thought. Any institution that publicly threatens the body with gunshot wounds or suffocation or lynching is more effective at terror.

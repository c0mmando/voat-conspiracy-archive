            ANSWER MY QUESTIONS, JEWISH PAID SHILL. WHY ARE YOU INCAPABLE OF ACCOUNTING FOR YOUR GOD’S FAILURES?
           </h1>
           <p>
            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer is not one of the ONLY TWENTY PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on an imageboard. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from multiple people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 20 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors bleeding onto imageboards expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved!
            <em>
             Don’t ever question the validity of these claims!
            </em>
            Just spend MONTHS ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!
           </p>

             </em>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Why, given the massive flight risk all globalists are, would anyone want to leak the proceedings of such an event in advance? Why would someone ostensibly leaking the proceedings not actually leak any information? Why would someone who claims to be on our side not give us a playbook for how to operate during the event? Why isn’t he telling us how to become leaders of our community to calm the terrified millions around us–who will inevitably exist once the media starts reporting on the “Trump coup”, or when they see their favorite media reporters arrested by the military live on air? Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

            <strong>
             Here are some more questions you’re too afraid to answer:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you substantiate your claims?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the credibility of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the MERE CONTENTS of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did nothing he said in the first half of November come true? Much less any of his longer-term predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why would he ALERT HIS FUCKING ENEMIES about a mass arrest on a public venue?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why isn’t he using this public venue (again, alerting all of his enemies and exposing him and his coup attempt) to DIRECT PATRIOTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL? Because he isn’t.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did these alerts begin MONTHS before the actual events? Do you have any idea how quickly these traitors can mobilize and flee a country? Still waiting for that martial law, by the way.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Do you fucking faggots put ANY thought into your spam these days? Why isn’t Q posting standardized, organized talking points that we, as individuals all around the country, would use in our home cities? When the fucking power goes out. When the fucking news comes on with, “We’re just getting word that Donald Trump has directed members of the armed forces to arrest every member of congress, much of the agencies of the executive branch, several justices, and may even be performing arrests of news officials. This is a coup, ladies and gentlemen…” NORMALFAGS ARE GOING TO BE FUCKING TERRIFIED, CONFUSED, AND WILL RALLY AROUND SOMEONE THEY KNOW AND TRUST IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITES (between rioting, that is). So if Q is real–and is a patriot–why isn’t he disseminating things for us to hold onto that can be spoken through a loudspeaker in a town square, when surrounded by friends, family, and fellow citizens?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because he’s not real. Because his earliest claims were proven false. Because only a fucking dipshit would give MONTHS notice to kikes of their “imminent” (Still waiting! Listen and believe!) arrests. And because only a fucking PAID SHILL would think we would fall for the “free lunch” scenario where the ✡government✡ (funny how Q, the civic nationalist, hasn’t directly mentioned anything about jewish control, huh?) arrests itself and we, the people, don’t have to lift a FUCKING FINGER, because the ZOG military will SURELY protect us!

           </p>
           <p>
            Now please, run along and kill yourself, you pathetic milquetoast piece of moral relativist shit.
            <strong>
             I call on anyone else who normally posts on CBTS or any of the other Q-related… what do I want to say, discussions… to enter into a dialogue.
            </strong>
            I’ve been following Q since the first threads in late October. I would like my questions answered, because none of the fucking faggots shilling for Q anywhere else on any other board is man enough to answer them.

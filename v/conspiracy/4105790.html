<p>I had seen many other instances of archive.org being used in this fashion for banned urls, with no repercussions from reddit inc., so I naturally assumed this method was condoned (especially if the archived link contains no TOS violations).

<p>To those wondering where I\'ve been, thanks for your concern, it really means a lot to me! The mod team here works really hard, and we all have our roles. One of my main roles is to combat the onslaught of trolls and shills that wish to merely mock, deflect and prevent <em>real</em> unity and progress. </p>
<p>Again, we all have our roles so this is not a slight on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mod team, but it\'s been very revealing how my presence in combating this behavior has been severely missed during the last several days...the comment sections and incessant onslaught of abuse against our community is out of control. The writing was on the wall with the swarm before the election, but it\'s endemic now. </p>
<p>It\'s quite clear that this has become far more than a mere partisan distraction, and that we\'re facing <em>the</em> battle for freedom of our time. </p>
<p>I feel very passionately about the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community, and no matter what it will live on. The best part is, we have retained our curiosity, one of mankind\'s most precious virtues. My ban is up on Monday, so I\'ll see you in two days!&quot;</p>

            The admins on /r/ banned a lot of us for posting anti-Biden content regarding the HB laptop.  I was banned for posting the word 'gnews.org'.  Not a hyperlink, not a link to any content, just a reference to a news site which contained no TOS violations.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's sad and sickening the way you've catered to and are now endorcinf the resdit censorship agenda.  I notice that the first thing you did when you got back to reddit was increase the participatiom length to 4 months.  Those of us who always participated in good faith and didn't have alts are now silenced for months, while the shills with their unlimited puppet accounts can flood the sub.  Seems a little too convenient to not be intentional.

             Well said and I agree, old friend. I was perma suspended for a 4 (almost 5) year old comment that I made. That means Reddit is retroactively suspending people for what they consider wrong speak now even though it didn't break any TOS  at the time. Like,
             <em>
              what the actual fuck

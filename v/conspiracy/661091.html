            Perhaps it's Zionist agenda to gain support for their Middle East takeover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it, before all of this we were pro Palestine, now we could give two shits if they bomb the Middle East. Ever since they let these savages in Europe; we think less highly of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The giant walls they have in Israel seem justifiable, the bombings of innocent people seem okay after they've raped their way into Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not even sure anymore what's real or twisted in the media.

            Almost basically I think. All zionists are jews while not all jews are zionists. Some people are just born into a religion and are unable to get out of it.

              Ok then maybe not zionism as the belief that the nation of Israel should continue to exist, but the zionism as in israeli ultra nationalism and imperialism.

              The first one being far more reasonable since it doesnt mean you support any of the violence or landgrabbing. I think every people should have the right to form a nation if they can keep it stable enough not to harm others, but definitely not in any place they want. That would make me a zionist according to the first definition.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I did mean though was the kind of radical and violent zionism that is happening and needs to be stopped.

            The thing about Paris, the Madrid bombings, the London tube bombings and 9/11 is that they were all isolated attacks. They were these huge, planned, massive events....and that's it.  That's not how terrorism works people. You have another attack in some place they're not expecting...and another..and another..and you keep going until the state destabilizes.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what happens with the current warlords in Iraq. This is what's happening with government funded terrorism in Syria.
           </p>
           <p>
            This doesn't happen in the West, because these attacks aren't real. They're planned. They do just enough damage to build nationalism. You read 1984 and it's the bomb blasts and shell explosions to remind people they are at war, while they fight for goods in the market.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're not in 1984. That's more North Korea...but there are aspects of it in our society. We are
            <em>
             free
            </em>
            and have free travel around the world. So instead of totalitarianism, they government uses media and money to control the narrative. It's pretty ingenious. No one is only to believe those fringe conspiracy theorists.

            The plot was always to push Europeans to exterminate the Muslims?
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe some of this has fallen out of their hands, maybe not but It still seems like they want to thin out the white europeans and intend to pit the more technologically advanced european and anglo civilizations against the regional enemies of israel but that doesn't explain the race cuckoldry, miscegenation and other things we've seen in attempts to reduce white populations, in number and spirit adequately.

            It's not Jews. It's Zionists. The ideology of Zionism is made of people who believe Israel should take over all the Palestinian land by religious and historical right. Zionism is the moral shield behind with the Israeli government hides while it conducts misdeeds. Only about half of Jews are Zionists. And there are
            <em>
             lots
            </em>
            of non-jewish Zionists, like Rupert Murdoch and most of congress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ideology of Zionism is the real core of the issue, if you want to be accurate.

             I wish more people would be more specific with their terminology like you are. Jews themselves are not any worse than any other organized religion (they are all bad to a certain degree). When people throw around "Jews did it!", what they really mean is ZIONIST did it. If we want anyone to take us seriously, we need to use the correct terminology!

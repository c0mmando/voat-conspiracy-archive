<p>So the transgenderism movement, as I understand, is part of the NWO agenda. I have now seen enough to be sure that this has gone on longer than many of us thought. My first real eye opener was finding out about the &quot;first&quot; transgender in Playboy in \'81, the year I was born. I was pretty shocked.</p>
<p>Last night I was brainstorming because I have this sense of everything being scripted, a total sense of the matrix. I\'ve had this feeling since wikileaks released things last year that had to do with CF, HRC, Podesta, etc. I\'m so late to waking up in this game. Anyway I was writing down all the blatant things that we are tolerating to see what all of it was pushing towards. Then for some random reason I remembered the conspiracy about Diana being murdered bc she &quot;knew something&quot;. So I searched voat and found a guy who claimed Diana was alive and a tranny, and they &quot;offed&quot; her/him because it was becoming a bit too obvious it was a man. But they really just let him go back to being a man, he\'s alive and well. He was down voted and ignored.</p>
<p>So I went and researched that and couldn\'t believe my eyes. But at the same time, it feels like it was obvious the whole time. We\'ve somehow learned to think that they just have weird appearances because they\'re royal and perhaps inbred. They\'re old lineage and more pure than the rest of us. Idk, some bs like that.</p>
<p>I recently have had the fortune of seeing a military trans MTF, and in person it is instantly obvious to me as a woman. My husband didn\'t notice until I pointed it out. The biggest things are that the hips to the feet are straight down, no inward angle, like the legs on an H as opposed to more of a V. Also the torso from the ribs the pelvis is a big flag as well. </p>
<p>Well, for a while I\'ve noticed women looking stronger and more angular, insanely taller, body fat nil. Especially in politics and the media/entertainment. I\'ve always thought Trump\'s wife was elegant but very odd. I wrote it off to plastic surgery. Was more than convinced that Michelle was Michael before I even knew there were conspiracies about it. Serena Williams always thought was a man.</p>
<p>And now, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are putting their biological child on hormones to transition her? I saw this on voat, wouldn\'t have ever even known. But she\'s like five years old.</p>
<p>Ok so now they\'ve normalized the idea of transgenders. But why? What is the point? I have no desire to be a man, and my husband has no desire to be a woman. Seeing it isn\'t increasing our acceptance, only considering them having a mental illness. And you say oh well they can\'t reproduce but it\'s clear that they certainly can, and it\'s definitely not part of reducing our population below 5m. So the next thing is transhumanism. But what is the ultimate purpose? What is the goal? The vast majority of people want nothing to do with any of this and I don\'t care how far you push for it, it\'s only going to make us like it less.</p>

            If you have a spare hour or two take the time to sit down and in your mind play out where this will all head.
See the transgenders, how they'll be years from now, how that movement will be if it takes over society, what someone has to gain from it etc etc then you will see where it all leads.
I believe they're trying to reimagine human society and create a civilization where the individual doesn't belong to a family unit or tribe, instead they belong to a system that operates outside of humanity and human intervention.
They are literally planning on building A.I. driven robots that can kill without any signals from humans ... 
Yes, if we don't do something to stop this now decades from now we will be living in a technocracy that will resemble parts THX1138, Deus Ex, The Matrix, Ergo Proxy etc
Transgenderism is just a tool to weaken societal cohesion.

           <p>
            The genocide of the white race and the mongrelization of all other races. People nowadays think science will make them live forever as transhuman transsexual cyborgs in space with VR waifus. It’s really retarded that they think science will forever progress and that nothing is beyond man. The problem with being purely scientific is you can only approach questions using verifiable and quantifiable notions. This is why philosophers don’t often overlap with scientists, and when they do they’re shunned (Michael Kaku is a good example of this–people hate him because he philosophizes). Transhumanists never question (or may be incapable of questioning) the nature of the consequences of transhumanism, and even the nature of the self.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because they entirely lack the ability to self-reflect, they will willingly trap themselves in machines with the foolish idea that their entire existence is contained within fatty matter. They see immortality as a moral obligation, they strive to achieve a world without death. They hope for it, but I fear it. Even if there is nothing after death, it is better than eternal life. If nothing exists after you die, then you need not fear it, as you will have no ability to do so. This is how I know that deep down, they, like everyone else, have an inescapable feeling that there is something after, like waking from a dream.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s funny how even with zombies and vampires so popular in media, these idiots still fail entirely to question the burden of immortality. And, particularly in this very specific case, they’re not even thinking about the implications of the economics of the matter. Instead of old people adding to a system that was never funded, can never be funded, and which is going to collapse in all its forms no matter how long people live, they’d prefer “young” people forever enslaved to the debt of the system in general. Force people to work for all eternity to pay back something that no one ever voted on or agreed to.

             Nothing wrong with immortality, A.I. waifus, transhumanism or VR ... it's just that you know you are in control of yourself and the tools that you are using.
Double-edged sword.

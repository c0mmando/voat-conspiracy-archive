            I agree with your premise. The constitution means little to those in power. Soon after it was ratified the Feds went to war with citizens of Pa over whiskey being used as currency. The Monroe Doctrine, war, war and more war...the list continues.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the illusion of freedom becomes unaffordable to the state, there will be no more pretense. As it is we may very well still be under some form of COG since 9/11 and everything from that point is just war theater. And the main attraction of the theater was to keep  people in an uneasy state of trauma who at once are 'terror'fied and then are told to not panic and carry on consuming.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think about it it does explain the yearly encroach of the freedoms, or the threats of. Survelience of everything. And the absolute complete disrespect the Gov.inc has for the people. Almost zero in terms of infrastructure development, especially when you consider the cost of updates. The tragic trajectory of pension funding. Etc. it explains this crazy clown world where nothing adds up. It explains the propaganda on full throttle. It also explains the fury the Elite has for DJT.
           </p>
           <p>
            So that being said what do you think about this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some point out that Rome didn't collapse overnight that it was a long drawn out fade. And thus by comparison they claim the same will happen to this country. A long incremental descent into the abyss.
           </p>
           <p>
            I somewhat agree with this. But it depends on when the collapse began.  Because we are here in 2019 people will say this is the starting point or when the fed began raising rates in 2018. I believe the period marking the collapse began with the assassination of JFK. That for me is when the CIA began ramping up there work on behalf of the corporatists. The government was hijacked, in essence a coup.
That's my starting point of the collapse. And thus the 60 years since has been that slow incremental decline.
           </p>
           <p>
            People talk about credit bubbles, the one we are in now has been affectionately named 'the Everything Bubble' . But the bubble blowing began in earnest in the 1980s and hasn't let up. All analysis of the markets,growth and value need to take that into account.
           </p>
           <p>
            I met a government economist in Italy hanging out at a bar in Florence. He clued me into a few things that were and will never be reported on in depth.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Mexican economy collapsed and the American economy collapsed. America bailed out Mexico and the IMF bailed out America. Take that for what you want.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the incremental decline...
9/11 bailed us out again. 22 trillion lost by the pentagon and 6 trillion lost overseas in the sandbox. This kept the illusion of growth along with a credit market for citizens until 2008, and why the country is broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then came 23 trillion bail out for the banksters, TARP and Cash For Clunkers, unemployment benes for 2 years. Basically Zero interest credit. And yet no infrastructure development.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did those with access to this free money invest in factories and technology and infrastructure? No they used it to buy their own stock back. Making all those in close proximity to the money supply very rich.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would they do this? Instead of building businesses and supply chains? Because they all know, having, I'm sure,  received the Memo. What do they know that we don't?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's over.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the  slow incremental disintegration of all institutions is reaching its peak. TPTB will no longer be able to mask government spending as growth. The credit market will freeze up even worse than 2008 and real valuation of all equities and real estate will be discovered. This will lead to global pandemonium.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only way out for the gov.inc is to start a war. Like they did with 9/11. Will the people be convinced by the same tired argument? WMDs, Democracy, genocide etc... Or will this be a war against all people through biological pathogens, geoengineering and other weapons we know the gov.inc has?
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, once they start a war, it's game over. What I mean is, it will never be the same again.
           </p>
           <p>
            The guns are not for the gov.they are for other people who want what you have. 
In this scenario the gov will not exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the degenerates will be those who, without the pressure of law, will act on their inner impulse.

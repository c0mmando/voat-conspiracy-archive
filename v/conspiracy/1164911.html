            Divide and conquer.  thug life gangster philosophy only leads to a basic division among members of the black community and only serves to divide it from the rest of society.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: the soviets purged their cabalists and then putin has had the rest exiled or else suicided, so they have to be brought back under the Illuminati influence. Lest we forget, the collapse of the SU lead to approximately 150 unaccounted for nukes, and should Russia and Putin suffer the same fate as Qaddafi and libya who knows  where the Federations arsenal would end up. It would not be good for us but would be great for the globalists.

             Archie Bunker had the best idea for gun control.
            </a>
            It was on a sitcom, supposed to be funny, but at it's core is true.  Just add his views on how to stop skyjackings to the gun free zones, and 9/11 or the mass shootings don't happen, or are single shootings opposed to mass shootings.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who aren't comfortable with protecting themselves are living in fear, and are the ones who would rather live a slave.  But that is if you call living a slave as living.  Which is what the ones ultimately responsible for these events,(the 1% funding BLM) view us as.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are the same ones who need to be told what to think instead of how to think.  When we can change that paradigm and mind set, then we have a chance.

            All I can imagine they give them is steroids and amphetamines. You can get those on your own.
           </p>
           <p>
            And even those I doubt help much. Modern weapons mean a soldier 3x as strong as a regular man would have very little advantage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh yeah, and training. They certainly give them more training. But you can train on your own. And besides, those dang modern weapons mean that someone with 3 months of training is 95% as good as someone with three years. So there's never going to be an Achilles/Hector type scenario again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now what I
            <em>
             can
            </em>
            think of them doing, is brainwashing you to serve their will unquestioningly and to die for them without hesitation. Other comments in this thread seem to confirm that. Of course, regular military members get that to
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            extent, but any "super soldier" program would do it much, much more. And would you really want that? I don't think so.

            You can't just send a resume to apply for top secret human trials. They don't even officially exist. It's arguable if they've even seen significant success outside of psychological manipulation.

            what the hell is wrong with you?!?!?! really hope this a joke
           </p>
           <p>
            i dont think being a "super soldier" is what you think it is. that stupid name has givin some sort of connotation that you are above the norm and better than the rest of society.
           </p>
           <p>
            you have to realize that people who are involved in those programs have been severely abused and tortured physically, mentally,sexually and emotionally from the day they are born to possibly the day they die (or they are not useful any longer).
           </p>
           <p>
            a more accurate term for these people would be psychic assets because it is what they are. they are gathered for their above than average psychic or spiritual "iq" and they are treated as assets not necessarily people.
           </p>
           <p>
            there is absolutely nothing super about being abused on a daily basis and then being used against your knowledge!

              Noble in a way. People will never see it as such. People these days give their lives for comfort and currency and little else. Although a nation of Christians, we only give our lives to behavior that directly benefits ourselves. But then we somehow seeyour behavior as irrational? At least you care enough to try and make something better. That is a quality that not many have, and it's a shame that you're in such a place that you feel the need to make the best of your existence by giving your life to someone else so they might accomplish something. I fear those who you'd give it to wouldn't deserve it, or put you to good use.
             </p>
             <p>
              Find a better way. If you must. What you're describing doesn't do the act justice.

              everyone has, now get over it and grow as a person instead of thinking up stupid notions. i suppose if you value yourself so little someone will at least make you a  trash bin. good luck with that asshat

            Project Talent picks you as a child (according to the SS on Project Camelot). If you weren't raised to be one, you most likely won't ever be one. Look to the private sector if you want to try the Transhumanist bullshit out.

             Those guys training requires extreme psychological trauma to induce suggestibility. They make great grunts and single use assassins, but terrible team leaders. The Chinese and some other eastern folks are dominating this field because they make quality officers and team leaders in addition to the grunts. The old Project Talent program is falling way behind because they don't produce anyone who can lead from the front.

            I'd wait on that if I was use, based on comic books - and some of these comic contain way more real info then most mainstream news sources - the success rate of actually coming out of the experiments alive is pretty low.

             I had a friend who was in the military for about 2 and 1/2 years, and he told me he was part of a program that they have since discontinued, but were trying to create warriors, not soldiers. His training group and a few before him, were ingrained with this "warrior" mentality, and given unknown injections but told it would make them better in combat.

             Well, he and another girl from his unit were the sole survivors of an "event," (enemy forces in Middle East, he never said which or where) and they are both fucked up beyond repair (mentally and physically). He basically has all the symptoms of schizophrenia, combined with his actual PTSD and who-the-fuck-knows what else as a result of the military's experiments. While at his house, he would often just snap at his dad and brother, flip out screaming, over NOTHING, and then act like nothing ever happened- NEVER apologized. EVER. The girl, from what he told me, is "relatively" normal, but obsessive and a pathological liar- but I didn't know her, so.
            </p>

             I knew him from highschool, so I had a good angle to compare him with. He was pro-military before, but after the army? And what they did to him? He still is. He loves the military, but hates the government, and blames them for everything. He's also a PASSIONATE Israel advocate. I stopped being friends with him because he told me that Palestine deserved everything that was happening to it.

             From what I've seen the Chinese are kicking everyone's asses in this area and have started field testing a virus that can insert myostatin inhibiting genes in the muscles of their own SS program. The US apparently needs officers willing to undergo gene therapy.

            I'm going to start a conspiracy about the golden cockroaches. That's right, they're golden in color, and they are intelligent. They have begun to kill the owners of the houses in which they live by crawling into their noses and mouths as they sleep and suffocating them. Then they crawl away and hide, and investigators believe that the person in bed had a heart attack. They are responsible for all the crib deaths you read about. If you put your ear to the wall, you can hear them humming -- that is them talking to each other, planning what they are going to do to you. Their eventual purpose is to eliminate humanity from the planet.

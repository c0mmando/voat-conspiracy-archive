            I remember reading something about civilization types in the universe, and how one of the 'natural steps' towards becoming a Type 1/2 civilization would be a so called "holographic society", as in; everyone knows
            <em>
             everything
            </em>
            about

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Not a bad idea if you ask me.

              The thing about the 'holographic society' might be hard to find - I read it back in 2006, I think. But the premise is rather simple, and falls in line with your own thoughts in the OP.

              The MO of the sniper attacks are indicative of a 2-3 man team, trained in the Special Forces ambush tactics of reconnaissance, insertion, concealment and successful evasion.  According to Jones’ research, the sniper team’s attack profile is consistent with US Special Forces ambush assassination tactics.

              It now appears the official story on the identification of John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo as the DC area snipers, and their arrest on October 24, 2002 is nothing but a contrived cover story for what really happened.

              I always had the feeling the full truth of this case was never told .. This of course was the bizarre case where for almost a month, America was caught in a grip of panic as a serial sniper killer or killers on a nonstop shooting rampage, conveniently right between the 9/11 and Anthrax events and while the buildup to the Iraq War was in full steam.
             </p>
             <p>
              So many aspects of this case seemed very strange from the get-go; from the reports of white vans seen fleeing at many of the crime scenes, even reports of white guys doing the shooting, death tarot cards left at the scene, the police chief reciting cryptic code word messages by the killer, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Everyone at first thought it was a lone white nut or a pair of white males with guns...aw, but wouldn't you know, it was the work of a "black Moslem and his psuedo adopted son," all with a .223 Bushmaster rifle and some beat up old car.

           A large amount of uranium is mined from within Russia as they contain a lot of deposits. So the question begs to be asked why would they want our uranium??? I am gonna just throw out a scenario for shits and giggles. Maybe "they" (the Russians , desperate deep state and NWO) wanted to get it from elsewhere so when they turned it over to one of America's enemies such as Iran or North Korea the paper trail would be difficult to follow and the blame could be shifted elsewhere? After all Putin is smart and is the former head of the KGB so he would use subversive tactics against the USA as opposed to brute force to take action against us. I also find it interesting that North Korea was claimed by numerous intelligence sources saying that "North Korea does not have the capabilities to create a nuclear weapon" and then poof suddenly North Korea is testing nuclear weapons??? Is this just a coincidence or is this planned chaos on part of Russia, the deep state and NWO to bait the USA into another war all the while weakening our ability to unify our nation?

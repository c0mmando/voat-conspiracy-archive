            I have thought about a "we are the baddies" sub where people can post factual and historical things their particular government has done in the past. For example: Cia experiments/programs, etc.

            I'd like to see some kind of game that we play on a regular basis. Maybe a "predict the future" game where we try and predict the outcome of current events based on our knowledge of the past. The person that predicts the future correctly gets a visit from the NSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd also like to see a group activity that  we all work together on regularly. We could, as a community, write a statement about current events. We could then have a frontman read the statement on camera.  Maybe a weekly news report about events that didn't quite make it the average viewer. It would, I think, be easily produced and useful as a recruiting tool. It would be very easily produced and cost nothing, but time. It would also help strengthen the community by  putting us all on the same page.

             Sound like neat ideas! I agree that some sort of group activity would be excellent. Games are a great idea too, something i hadn't thought of. People like games, so it'd be great to combine active participation and some healthy fun and high spirits! :D
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: I also think the video thing and the prediction game are cool ideas. I'd be interested in seeing what people think about those, and how they might be fleshed out some more. : ]

            Is there a way to combine duplicates into a group?
           </p>
           <p>
            I see a lot of duplicate posts elsewhere that almost seem to be there just to fragment the conversation. The new one pops up with something stupid as the first comment, and all conversation stops and the first one drops from view.  Is there a way to combine the posts that all link to the same article\video\picture, so the discussion does not get fragmented out and dropped?

             (Warning: long rambling ahead)
            </p>
            <p>
             That would be pretty useful. On reddit some of the larger subreddits have a rule about not permitting multiple posts relating to the same topic, to try to consolidate the discussion to one location - and that rule gets a fair amount of complaints against it as a tool of abuse or censorship to legitimize removing highly upvoted posts in favor of less successful ones. But the idea of being able to combine them would be really handy - not just for our subverse but for others as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess the question would be, how are two posts chosen to be associated? If they're on the same topic, but the links don't share the same URL it would almost have to be something done by either moderators or by the users. The traditional solution to this issue is that users are vigilant and post links to older discussions in the comments... but that's not always ideal, and that alone won't bring those old comments into the current discussion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's kind of what i'm picturing... each subverse can have the option of having this on by default or off by default. When you view a post that has been associated with another post, if this function is enabled, you'll see comments from both posts but they will be marked somehow as to which post they originated in. Links to both posts will be available at the top, though the link for the specific post you clicked on to open the discussion page will be prominent, with a slightly larger font maybe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comment ordering might be separated by the post the topics belong to, so the comments for the main post you clicked the link for are all at the top, then there is a horizontal rule, the headline for the next associated post and its comments below it, another rule and associated post, etc. Or all of the comments are ordered by whatever comment sorting option you've selected (top/new) and each comment is tagged somehow with which post it was originally made in response to. Alternatively top-level comments are weighted by their age and scores, sort of like the "hot" feature for sorting posts perhaps?
            </p>
            <p>
             When you share a comment, you could opt to make it to that post (default function) or opt to make it to one of the associated posts.
            </p>
            <p>
             You'd have the option to filter out older discussions if you wanted to, and of course the option to toggle off(/on) discussions from associated posts as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             So i think that that could provide a fair interface. Probably not ideal, but certainly interesting and worth giving a try.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a discussion on this post which sort of aims to address the same issue, but more in terms of cross-subverse postings:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/73495">
              https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/73495
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             As for how posts would be associated... i suppose they could be chosen by the users? Anyone could link posts together maybe, and people could vote on how related/relevant they are?
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe instead of this being built-in to each post it's a separate thing. Like, a super-discussion post could be created...
            </p>
            <p>
             users can mix and merge any posts they deem relative to one another, votes on those determine the strength or community confidence in that relationship. Based on that, you could have collections of user-generated multi-post-discussions. These could be accessible in a top section of the post's individual discussion pages, maybe a list of them or a "related" tab that shows a list of them...
            </p>
            <p>
             I think there would need to be a motivating factor for people to vote on how related posts are to one another or to their super-post discussions. I suppose people could subscribe to larger super-discussions like they might subscribe to a subverse? hmm that might be going too complicated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course this still doesn't solve the issue of redundancy in the comments, or the fact that there are sometimes an abundance of comments that flood out the more interesting ones despite the ability to sort by voting. But it would bring together related discussions - so long as the people who seek out such related posts and discussions are rewarded in some way for finding them and suggesting them...

             Sorry for the long rambling wall of text. Most of that is something that would need to be coded up and done by the site admin(s). As users and mods, we could possibly create some sort of incentive system to encourage people to post links to related discussions in the comments, and encourage people to visit them and try to bring the older comments into the current discussion. Maybe a reward system for finding really pertinent old comments/discussions.

            Anyone who has dealt with me on reddit before my ban knows I'm a very fair person.  I enjoy what
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            used to be and

             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            is now.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            reminds me of the old conspiracy subreddit.  Yes I mock some comments and tease somewhat but I've been treated very well here.  Not so on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            .  So much paranoia over there.  They even annoyed
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
             /r/conspiratard
            </a>
            so much the mods there changed the rules which in turn created a few new more focused subs.  I once did an AMA in
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/coontown">
             /r/coontown
            </a>
            and was treated far better than I was in
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            .  Sad when racists are more open for discussion than the conspiracy theorists.
           </p>
           <p>
            That leads me to my second question.  How would you keep the stormfronters/chimpire types out of this subverse?  Obviously you can't keep them all out but
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            got blindsided and now
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/isrconspiracyracist">
             /r/isrconspiracyracist
            </a>
            is doing way better than it should.  The conspiracy mods should have seen that and taken action.  I mod
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/isvconspiracyracist">
             /v/isvconspiracyracist
            </a>
            here too and it's pretty much dead.  So kudos to the mods here for that.

             Sorry my other comment was a bit of a wall of text, and i didn't even address your last question.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a good question to ask. What could we do to keep bigoted posts and comments out? Well for one thing we have a rule against "overt attacks on people's race, religion, ethnicity, nationaliry, or creed", moderators have the ability to remove comments and posts, and users have the ability (if they've got enough CCP) to downvote. If mods and users are vigilant, then that is one strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you have any particular suggestions for how it can be approached? Ideas or thoughts?

              Listen to your good users when they say "there's racists here".  Also, allow the users to call out racists and racist posts.
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              gets butthurt about that.  I'm not saying every user will be right but listening to the community and be aware of what's posted in your sub would make a world of difference.  I have some users I trust more than others and when they tell me something is wrong or needs to be removed I check it out immediately and solve the issue.  I think
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
               /v/conspiracy
              </a>
              is doing a great job so far but trust me.....chimpire/coontowners/stormfronters are here and they're growing.  I talked to a few of them and they're preparring for their subs to get banned and they'll move over here.  I want you and the users here to be aware of that.  Hopefully this mod team which you are a part of will take a stronger approach to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would hope you'd also allow people like me who are civil but disagree with much of what is in your subverse to participate here.  I enjoy talking to people who believe all kinds of stuff.  I even talk to the racists.  I disagree with them but they find it fun to talk to me.  So do some of your users.  redditbelowsme is a testament to that.  He's a 9/11 truther and one of my mods in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/humor">
               /v/humor

              .  We're pretty good pals.  I just don't want to be treated like

               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              treats my type.  I think
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
               /v/conspiracy
              </a>
              is better than that.  Let's hope.

             I personally find bigotry abhorrent, however it manifests. I believe that there is no good reason to mock a person for their skin color or sexuality or nationality or age or religion. Stereotypes can be incredibly harmful. I'm thankful that this subverse hasn't grown so large as to attract the attention of bigoted commenters, and that
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/fenixrisin">
              @fenixrisin
             </a>
             established early on the rule against bigotry in the sidebar. Though I haven't seen much actual active moderation for those things (due to a lack of need), i think having it there does help to express what sort of community is desired here.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe that
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
              /r/conspiratard
             </a>
             promotes bigotry. I believe that a good deal of the posters there see anyone interested in conspiracies as part of a group that deserves to be ridiculed, attacked, maligned. Perhaps it is in good fun, but even racist jokes can seem to be purely in good fun to some people.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I understand,
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/topmindsofreddit">
              /r/topmindsofreddit
             </a>
             is an offshoot of the community of
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
              /r/conspiratard
             </a>
             when the mods there established a rule about linking to
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             , ostensibly to deter brigading. I know brigading and linking to other places on reddit from within reddit is a gray area, so i won't make any judgments there, but there is a connection between a culture that i perceive as toxic and the culture of the people who migrated to that subreddit - and by extension that same culture is likely connected to your subverse.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it bothers me.
            </p>
            <p>
             When you and I talked before, you shared with me a different perspective on the thing. You said it's good to laugh at the silly people who take things to extremes. You seemed to suggest that you think some conspiracy theories are legitimately worth looking into, but the real nutty ones can be entertaining. You said that if you can't laugh at yourself, that that is dangerous. I'm paraphrasing, and possibly remembering incorrectly, but that's the impression i got from our talk about how you feel about
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/topmindsofreddit">
              /r/topmindsofreddit
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/topmindsofvoat">
              /v/topmindsofvoat
             </a>
             . I think there is truth to it. I think if it can be balanced, then it can even be beneficial to regulars here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Words are one thing and actions are another. Your subverse,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/isvconspiracyracist">
              /v/isvconspiracyracist
             </a>
             states in the title "yes, yes it is", and one of your posts expresses a desire for more racists to come here as there isn't enough racism to post about. Why? If you sincerely do not believe in bigotry or the value in racism, then why wish for it, and why try to portray our subverse as something shameful when it isn't? If your intentions are as pure as you present them, then why do they conflict with your apparent actions?
            </p>
            <p>
             The content on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/topmindsofvoat">
              /v/topmindsofvoat
             </a>
             is mostly benign so far, and still the tone of the whole thing is grating. Instead of calling conspiracy theorists common pejoratives like "twoofer" or "tinfoil hat loonies", now we are "top minds" all of us for the comments some random person on reddit made. It's just another pejorative. It's like when my grandpa says that not all black people are niggers ("not all conspiracy theorists are top minds"), but then goes ahead and refers to most black people he saw as niggers anyway. My grandpa wasn't a bad guy on the whole, but he was bigoted in many ways. I don't think you're a bad guy either, but I do think there is a fair bit of bigotry intertwined with the communities you are a part of.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, long story short, your subverses make me uneasy and while they don't seem to have much activity currently I am not confident that they will not degenerate whenever a random person or two decides to say something dumb on this subverse. As a commenter you seem respectful and appear to offer no reason to treat you without courtesy in my opinion. I hope that you will try to make it clear in your involvement with
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/topmindsofvoat">
              /v/topmindsofvoat
             </a>
             what you've expressed to me, that not all of
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
              /v/conspiracy
             </a>
             and not all of the people who post and comment here with an interest or even
             <em>
              belief
             </em>
             in various conspiracy theories are foolish or deserving of ridicule. Similarly with your involvement in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/isvconspiracyracist">
              /v/isvconspiracyracist
             </a>
             , i hope that you choose to try to answer the topical question honestly and objectively.

            So I think it might be good if everybody were familiar with trolling tactics, to be able to identify them and not get duped into engaging in disruptive arguments. My supposition here is that the people who do engage in discussion with them aren't aware they are trolls. I suppose there are two other possibilities. They may know and are trying to disprove the troll to onlookers, to prevent propaganda or disinformation from spreading. They may know and are willing participants in the flame war, acting to try and create drama and disruption together with the apparent troll.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hmm. Somewhat related to that last one is people who are irrational or highly dramatic in support of a particular theory with little supporting evidence, people who pose as sincere seekers of truth but are in fact intending primarily to cause disruption, paranoia and distrust amongst the community. This could be hard to identify or distinguish from sincere good intentions sometimes. I suppose it's like the man said, if the troll is obeying the rules then it's effectively no troll at all.

             I've been looking through the backlog of meta-discussions recently and have seen a couple of other people mention this as well. I'll look into it. From what I understand, the CSS on this sub is one created on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/typogra">
              /v/typogra
             </a>
             . Perhaps whoever created it has come up with an updated version. If not, maybe I can finally dip my toe in CSS and try to figure it out.

               Alright, so I've done a bit more searching and it seems that there is currently no way to have a custom stylesheet that also permits night mode, but it
               <em>
                is
               </em>
               a planned feature. So our options currently are to either keep the current stylesheet/CSS/appearance which lacks night mode, to go back to the plain default styling which does permit night mode, or to find an alternative stylesheet which might be appealing to users using night mode without being a bother to those who prefer not to use night mode.
              </p>
              <p>
               edit: a relevant post here:
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Typogra/comments/73928">
                https://voat.co/v/Typogra/comments/73928
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               edit2: in the meantime, I have updated the stylesheet for
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
                /v/conspiracy
               </a>
               to the latest version of typogra, which according to the notes on the github seem to fix a few issues the old version had with comment highlighting, and most visibly fixes the appearance of the subverse chat. I've kept the header image at the same size it was though rather than the default for typogra which is larger.

            That is a neat idea! Though sources vary in quality/reputability, and the definition of a source would need to be defined as well - some articles are basically just reporting the same information from a single common source. I like it. I think it might need to be fleshed out a little bit, but I'm glad you have shared it. Thank you.

            The #1 thing I would like to see is tolerance of ALL discussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't like a particular conspiracy theory, then just move on, don't jump in and start calling everyone names and saying how stupid the theory is. It might be nice for the mods to "remind" users of that as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, would you go to
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Yankees">
             /r/Yankees
            </a>
            if you hated Baseball and the Yankees? And would you go there and start telling everyone how stupid baseball is, and how much the Yankees suck? Probably not. Then why do people go to Conspiracy threads and do just that?
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't count how many times there was a post on Reddit about chemtrails and the top 20 posts were all something like: "Not this shit again, chemtrails are not real, they are con-trails, here is a link, you are stupid and you are the reason this sub has such a bad rep, GTFO OP" (with 289 upvotes)
           </p>
           <p>
            How about a place where we can discuss CT's without the fear of getting harassed and bullied for being curious and wanting to explore the strange and sometimes bazaar world of conspiracy theories?
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether you want to talk about chem-trails, Bigfoot, Bermuda triangle, 9/11, JFK, NWO, or something completely out there, it would be nice to have a community that shared in the interest and RESPECTED each-other.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying that I don't want other views or good debates, I am just really sick of how
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            is basically overrun by people who absolutely do not believe in any CT and they go there simply to argue and tell the actual subscribers how dumb they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the mods are on top of things and set the tone early, it would be a start. Just simply reminding people where they are would be better than nothing. You are in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            , that means we are going to be talking about conspiracy's and we take some of the seriously. If you don't want to be part of the active discussion then maybe this isn't the subverse for you.

            Honestly, I feel like there should be a rule that you need evidence to back up a claim here. To many times have I seen someone make a ridiculous claim and when asked for a source responded with either "you can google it yourself" or "insert argument over how the burden of proof is on me for questioning the claim somehow.

             . I hate to try to tell people they
             <em>
              can't
             </em>
             respond in a particular way, creating arcane social conduct rules, but at the same time I recognize that it's stuff like that which harms productive dialogue and hampers the "quest for truth" as it were. I think something like that could be a fair strategy to try to improve the quality of discourse here compared to other places, at least experimentally.

            Makes some sense. I don't personally think that the world is about to end or martial law is about to be declared, but having some sort of designated and visible places to discuss the latest hot topics could be really good - especially if people are advised to sort the comments by "new" to avoid vote manipulation or echo chamber effects.

            I see. So the purpose of the thread would be to help everyone to be more informed about what the latest doom&amp;gloom theories/news are, to focus the conversation in a single place rather than it being diffused throughout several individual posts that get slid down as new content is posted on other things?

            Conspiracy forums always get wadded up with low-quality content by what I call Serial YouTube Kiddies.
           </p>
           <p>
            They make themselves feel like Courageous Cusaders for Good be posting links to as many of the 1.3 billion YouTube conspiracy video re-mixes as possible per day.  Good discussion and good documentaries are flushed away by this nonsense.  (Perhaps it's a conspiracy. :-) )
           </p>
           <p>
            Small idea.  Don't allow direct links to YouTube videos.  Make it so people are encouraged to write a short paragraph explaining what a video is, and what can be gained from watching it.  This would cut down on the garbage.

             Yes. I am so tired of "go watch this" with no description included. 50% of the time its somebody talking about reading an article, the other 40% its something I didn't want youtube to put in my viewing history...
            </p>
            <p>
             Requiring a description of the video content with any youtube or video submission would be great.

             I agree that fluff and, I suppose spam, can really lower the value of someplace like this. I know it has for me on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             . Not sure that it's strictly youtube videos, but just an overabundance of topics - particularly those with inflammatory headlines and such - drowns out more interesting discussions. I guess though that brings up the question of the purpose of a sub like this. Is it a news aggregator, pulling together any and all content related to conspiracies, or is it a discussion forum, or is it a hub for a community to collectively help each other understand conspiracies, or some combination of those, or something else? I guess if it's purely a news aggregator with a commenting feature, then it makes sense to not limit anything from being posted - flood it with every alternative media article and video there is, and let the votes organize it. But I don't know. Something about that is not appealing to me. Perhaps there is a moderate way to balance all of that.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like the idea of encouraging people to write a brief description of a video. Not sure about requiring it across the board. Definitely an interesting and neat idea though.

             This is a horrible idea, forcing any particular kind of content source is a horrible idea!  This is backwards, not forwards, forcing people to participate by not being able to share certain things won't make them participate it will just make them go somewhere else.

              How do you like MagnaFarce's idea though? Requiring a summary blurb might discourage posts of those hour long videos that only contain five minutes of important or new data. It also could help spur discussion. A big problem I've seen on smaller subreddits was many posts with no discussion.

               It's better, but it's still forcing people and it will just turn self-posts into a shit show of whether it's an actual self-post or not, not actually improve quality in any way.

             I really like the idea of
             <em>
              only
             </em>
             allowing self posts. If you've got a video or an article to share post a link in the body and say something about it. It certainly does more to spur conversation as well.

              That could be neat. I suspect that I'd find that to be a really valuable change, at least worthy of an experimental period - if not mandatory perhaps at least a voluntary one.

            Something that I've kind of toyed with in the past on reddit was the idea of community-driven projects (see:
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracyprojects">
             /r/conspiracyprojects
            </a>
            ). Things like consolidated vocabularies of all the different terms, characters, theories that are popular or significant in the conspiracy theory world. Or a process through which theories are reviewed, indexed, information compiled and organized, from an open-minded
            <em>
             and
            </em>
            skeptical viewpoint. Or some sort of timeline project. Basically things that help those trying to learn, trying to piece things together for themselves, but all of it sort of crowdsourced with community involvement, promoting a sense of pride in each other and familiarity. None of this is really fleshed out, just ideas.

             I approve.  Reminds me of why I like rationalwiki so much. That even why I might disagree with their consensus view sometimes, they do a very good justice to alternative views with comprehensive references and attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: I'm less swayed by the ranking scale though. Never did like ranking things. I find comparing them more than sufficient for my purposes. I find ranking systems invite bullying. My 2¢.

              I like rationalwiki too, except when it gets a bit scoffing at things that don't meet the status quo. I seem to recall adding an image to their page on crop circles back in the early days of one of the more famous and large elegant designs to have been found, while the the text on the page said something to the effect of "crop circles are areas of flattened wheat made by two guys with boards and rope". The image is gone now, replaced with a cartoon of aliens playing tic-tac-toe. So definitely not as unbiased or objective as I would personally prefer. But yes, the general idea is similar.

              Would you be willing to elaborate on your concerns about the rating system? I think it's useful to be able to distinguish between groups of theories like hollow earth, reptilians morphing on news broadcasts, and tinfoil hats versus theories like CIA killing JFK, Monsanto seeking global food supply control, 9/11 controlled demolitions, and versus theories like operation mockingbird, the nariyah incubator lie, and gulf of tonkin.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's just a tool, from my perspective, for categorizing things to make discussion easier, not neccesarily a universal definitive objective "This theory is definitely batshit insane!" and "This theory shall always be in the class 3 section, will never be deemed essentially proven!" sort of deal.

               Monsanto is a willing patsy for Bayer, Dupont, Pfizer, the list goes on. Take a look at the size of those other corporations and their investment in the conspiracy. Monsanto is just the tip of the iceberg.

               Hollow earth is still pretty compelling to me. As are perception fields failing during live broadcasts. Neither of my positions on those subjects implies I wear tinfoil hats. ~~Besides, everyone knows a steel colander is 800% more effective at shielding mind control rays.~~ Struckthru bit was sarcasm.

               Nriyah incubator lie is news to me. More info on what that is would be nice.

               's rules or anything. I feel it would be prone to abuse, and that these ratings would be subjective rather than objective, and thus treat the fringe of the fringes unfairly.

                Yeah I get what you're saying about the idea of a group deciding on some sort of official determination on a theory. I'm not saying that it is impossible for the hollow earth theories to be true, nor that it is impossible for peter jennings to actually be an alien or demon or something accidentally shapeshift on TV. I just think it makes sense to be able to classify these things based on the amount of evidence supporting them. There are mountains of evidence that 9/11 was a controlled demolition, and even more solid evidence that MKULTRA and operation Mockingbird were real projects, compared with minimal evidence for hollow earth, flat earth, and shapeshifting tv correspondents. A lack of sufficient evidence doesn't mean the theories are not worth investigating, doesn't mean they aren't true, just means that more investigation is required for those in order to convince a neutral or skeptical person.

            Right now, it seems like we just have too few users. How can we get people here and get them to stay? And how can we get existing users to post more content? I think this sub is suffering from a newbie/shyness complex right now (I'm guilty, too). Let's try to get the ball rolling with some great, quality OC. :)

             Seriously, by all means everybody, step it up!  It gets tiring that those statistics about group participation in social networking sites is consistently proven true;  that about 1% start discussions 5% participate in discussions and the rest just lurk or in the case of sites like reddit and voat, voat.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not that hard to muck rake, just trawl your facebook news feeds, follow interesting pages, check the new tab on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             , check ALL the alt media sites, etc etc and then just share share share!
            </p>
            <p>
             If we could  just take that 5% and make them into 1% types, it's game over.

              I agree that more active involvement would be good, though i'd like to see an increase in the 5% types perhaps moreso than those submitting content. I think an overabundance of information and stories can drown out discussion in a small community. That's why things like forum sliding are something to be mindful of. Don't get me wrong, I really like having regular news and posts about conspiracy-related content, but I think there has to be a balance at some point.

               All too true. But mods can have an influence by upvoting, featuring and stickying perhaps.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, the OP have an influence. Instead of posting several posts on a similar topic, they could post new articles and links in the discussion of one post. I'm trying this myself here, and I like it. Though admittedly it feels a bit narcistic to be the only one doing it on my own post.

             The nice thing about voat is that it's still in development, so any issues with the site itself we as users still have the potential to remedy through suggestions on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/ideasforvoat">
              /v/ideasforvoat
             </a>
             (or if we know c# we can submit changes directly through pull requests on github). As for moderation, well atko mentioned about a week ago that the current owner of the subverse is inactive, and that technically the sub is eligible for requests for ownership transfer. Having seen that comment sitting there for three hours or so, I went ahead and requested ownership on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/subverserequest">
              /v/subverserequest
             </a>
             . I can't guarantee i'll be a good moderator, but if it goes though I'll do what I can to try and prevent some of the kinds of problems that the mods on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             may have been involved in. That's part of the reason i made this post, so I can get some ideas of what might be appropriate to do as a mod.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that it's a lot less active than it could be. I think there's value in that too, because it means it's easier to set a tone that can persist into the future as the community grows. Perhaps we can come up with ideas to encourage the shy people to participate. From what I've seen, we haven't yet had huge problems with trolling and flaming in the comments, but I can imagine folks accustomed to that being hesitant to share their thoughts on discussion pages.
            </p>
            <p>
             And also, maybe if we do come up with some gimmick or quirk or value that sets us apart, makes us stand out, that in itself will encourage others to join. I personally think one of the best things we could do is to have a civil, thoughtful, and friendly community culture - even better if our users are skilled at handling trolls and inflammatory things. But that's not something you can really dictate from a top-down level, it's something that has to grow organically i guess. I think voat's got a lot of potential there right now though.

              I welcome you as my new mod overlord. ;) In all seriousness, I'm glad someone is stepping up to the plate. Has your request been accepted yet?
             </p>
             <p>
              So far the community seems very civil and maybe we can enforce this with the community. When we see someone getting inflammatory, we the users should comment on it civilly and not wait for a mod to manage crowd control. That's something we could at least encourage in the side-bar. Not just a "report it to the mod" mentality, but attempt to manage it yourself by letting that user know that it's not really socially acceptable to antagonize on this sub, etc. I'm not sure how you'd phrase this on the side-bar, though. Good thing I'm not a mod! ;)

               Haha, no I think that's a great idea. Even if you or I don't have the perfect wording for it, I think it's better than nothing and through soliciting help from more eloquent people we could always improve the phrasing later on. :P

              <p>
               No it hasn't been accepted yet, but none of the others after or a bit before mine have been either, so it's just waiting until atko has some spare time. I'm perfectly fine with that, too. Not really impatient because the positive side of that is that he, someone who seems to genuinely care and be a good sincere person, gets to make the decisions.

            So here are some random thoughts off the top of my head, in no particular order.

              Something that bothers me about
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              is that it often has a very low signal to noise ratio. Quality content is buried while fluff and silly things gain prominence on the front page. Often this is blamed on vote manipulation, but sometimes I think it is just that the subreddit has such a poor reputation that people on
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/all">
               /r/all
              </a>
              downvote most things there regardless of what they were.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              A lot of times the comments sections on
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              are a mess. I particularly dislike the flame wars that people get into, attacking each other, accusing someone of being a shill, or mocking people for believing in x or y conspiracy theory prompting angry responses.

              That podcast fiasco. The moderators making an "official"
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              podcast with flytape wearing that silly mask, the silly video effects, rambling on about reddit meta-gossip, all without any community input. I think a podcast is fine, but there is a lack of interplay between the mods there and the community that is frustrating. I think if moderators are
              <em>
               going
              </em>
              to try official projects like that, there
              <em>
               has
              </em>
              to be community involvement at least to some degree, at least announcing it beforehand and seeking / listening to opinions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I think the mods here might ought to promote commenting etiquette that reduces the harmful impact of trolls or other disruptive elements.
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              has had a link to a copy of "the gentleperson's guide to forum spies", which is nice, but perhaps not the most comprehensive or directly applicable guide. Maybe we can find or compile superior or similar guides and include them as links in a prominent position on the sidebar.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Skepticism is really high up on my list of values. It's the reason I suspect many conspiracy theories have validity, because I am skeptical of the official narrative. I think sometimes we go so far against the status quo that we suspend skepticism for alternative theories/stories, which can be really dangerous with misinformation and even moreso with
              <em>
               dis
              </em>
              information. I don't know exactly how, but I feel like we as a community should promote strong skepticism of all stories/theories - not to the point of outright dismissing things without investigation of course; keeping an open mind, weighing available evidence and following what leads are present, and determining if there is merit or not. edit: one tool useful for this might be the concept of
              <a href="https://archive.is/6tXD7">
               the conspiracy theory rating scale
              </a>
              .

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              persistence of information. Both reddit and voat suffer from a problem with this; the setup favors what is new and attention-grabbing, not necessarily what is useful or informative, and it favors reposts and redundancy rather than consolidation and organization to make information and discussions accessible. I'm not sure what strategies could be employed to fix this, but I think if anything were dreamt up which could alleviate this problem, it would go a long way toward making our subverse excellent.

             Mods can alleviate part of the problem by showcasing certain discussions for a period of time (with a temporary sticky), creating recurring threads like 'This week in wonderland' or 'best discussion of this month', encouraging reviews of books or other resources and starting AMA's with experts etc. Or open source investigations like on the corbett report.

              I think that's a very good idea. I wonder how we might go about selecting discussion topics.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just had a discussion with the mods on
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/redditdayof">
               /r/redditdayof
              </a>
              about how they go about selecting their daily discussion topics. It's pretty interesting and there might be a way that it could be adapted to serve the purpose discussed here. On their subreddit they have a daily discussion topic, people post things related to the topic and for the items which is most highly upvoted, the poster gets to suggest a topic for future discussions and it's added to the queue. Perhaps we could have some sort of reward system for those who produce quality posts or discussions that they get to pick next week's discussion topic or something. That description alone isn't
              <em>
               quite
              </em>
              like what you've described, but maybe it could be a base which could be fleshed out some. In any case, the idea is pretty exciting to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we could find a way to conduct full on open-source investigations (I'm not 100% sure how Corbett does it because i haven't yet purchased a subscription to access their forums), that would be pretty awesome. I don't know if github would be best for something like that, since it wouldn't be code. I know that colloquially open-source just means taking everybody's contributions and putting it together, but maybe tools like github or similar might be possibly used to streamline the process.

               Sounds like a great idea! Also, you could post a sticky with this question: what topics would you like to discuss? Compiling a list based on answers and interest in the proposed topics as evidenced by votes.

               I don't have a subscription to the corbett report yet either. But from browsing I gather that James proposes a topic and subscribers can post resources in the comments. Which can be done as well here. He than uses the resources to make an article or podcast.

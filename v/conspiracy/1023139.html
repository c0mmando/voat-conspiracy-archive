            It would be cleverer to illustrate the chilling effect by stating that we can trust the government but

             hinting that you're saying it under duress
            </a>
            . What I'm trying to tell you is that treating the assignment like just a blog entry would be doing a disservice to your generation. Do some research and prove that the people in control (who aren't limited by national boundaries) are malevolent. Even if you can prove they cracked a few eggs to make omelettes, it can be argued that
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemonic_stability_theory">
             anything that challenges the world hegemon
            </a>
            invites another world war and the ascendance of a new hegemon (
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Conspiracy/comments/921144">
             like China
            </a>
            ) that's even more oppressive. If that's what the authority believes it's preventing, then divide and rule is actually more humane that allowing an unstable balance of power.

            For the ad, how about a black silhouette of a guy on a computer chair seen from behind (using just negative space for the guy and chair), in front of a videowall (grid of screens) with some Matrix style codes (nothing but the screens lit, black background on the rest of the picture), and saying something like:
           </p>
           <pre><code>They know what you've been doing.

Do you know what they are doing?
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Written in a computery font bellow past where the wheels of the chair would be.
           </p>
           <table>
            <tbody>
            </tbody>
           </table>
           <p>
            edit: or maybe instead of having Matrix code on the screens, add SFW close-ups of porn (skin, hair, corner of lips, shoulders, elbows, toes etc; stuff people can see is human and intimate, but that you can show in your class without concern. And add a CRT-ish effect on the screens to make them look a bit like the screens from the Architect's room from the movie.

            You trust the government enough to raise red flags on an assignment specifically designed to flush out who's a dissenter, doesn't that invalidate your argument? Besides cringey memes making fun of how Native Americans speak English, I'm not sure what your argument is. If an authority can be trusted, it makes sense to obey them. The question is specifically whether the authority is more likely to be benevolent or malevolent. For example, Bill Gates sits in at all these Bilberberg meetings, so he's either a good guy and everyone's good, or a bad guy and everyone's bad, since being a good guy and allowed to know the secret plans of the evil elites would be ridiculous--a house divided against itself cannot stand. Now if you say he's evil, you have to say why, explore the NWO agenda (Georgia Guidestones?) and figure out why he's spending so much to educate (indoctrinate?) Africans; are all his philanthropic efforts just a misdirection? This is a whole rabbit hole people spend often their entire lives down, and 5 minutes spent on hand-waving and memes just confirms every negative stereotype about millenials.

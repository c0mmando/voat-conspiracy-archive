           <p>
            I just did a Google search and I could find nothing from the vice president in regards to vaccinations and how deadly they are. Do you have an official link somewhere from a credible source I can look at?

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I am aware some people have had bad reactions from vaccinations, but this can be said about pretty much any medicine out there. Every drug had a side effect, the severe ones are rare, but they do occur. Educate yourself, the chance of having a severe reaction that would require hospitalisation and potentially result in death is about 1 in 100,000. Obviously it varies depending on the vaccination being administered.

           <p>
            Neither do I. I don't agree with flu shots any more than you do. I think they are a waste of time and nothing more than a money maker for pharmaceutical companies. A flu shot isn't a life saving vaccine, so therefore it isn't a problem if people don't get them (I definitely don't get them).

           <p>
            I have done research. There is no proven link between the foods we eat or hair products and rise of illnesses like pertussis. The data is still quite new, but there are reports coming out showing dramatic increases in illnesses like pertussis especially which is whooping cough and deadly to infants.

           <p>
            A flu shot or tetnis shot is not in the same league as a pertussis vaccination or any other equally life saving vaccination. How can you even compare? It's apples to oranges.

            If I worked for a pharmaceutical company, what benefit would there be for me to ramble on about the benefits of vaccinations, unless I owned the company or I was trying to sell you something? I am a front-end developer for your reference.

            People are entitled to their own views, just like I am entitled to my views as well. Religion is not an excuse to neglect your child. If you have a child and they die from a preventable disease due to the lack of vaccination, the parents should be tried for manslaughter and child neglect. But that is just my opinion.

            Vaccinations are not the only kinds of drugs that people have severe reactions to. Every kind of drug whether it is ingested or injected intravenously can have a side effect. Even paracetamol can have side effects in some people. I am sorry that you and your brother have suffered from lifelong disabilities, but you have to realise that this is not a common thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people are unfortunate to have reactions to drugs, just like some people are allergic to peanuts or gluten. I was vaccinated as a child and I am fine. Everyone I know has been vaccinated are fine to my knowledge. My child has been getting his required vaccinations and he is fine too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again sorry to hear you and your brother had a bad reaction, but this isn't justification or cause to warrant that everyone shouldn't be vaccinated.

            Unless your child is allergic to a particular vaccine, there is no reason to NOT vaccinate your children, religion and personal beliefs are not a valid excuse to decide your child should not be vaccinated. When it comes to vaccinations, I can see doctors being concerned because we are seeing legitimate increases in cases of preventable diseases, at levels quite unseen for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            This story is not about vaccinations though, so back on topic. It is about a general practitioners overreach by asking personal questions that the mother didn't feel comfortable answering or letting her children answer nor was aware they would be asked.

            I think the "properly socialised" component is less concerning than the other questions the doctor asked about guns and and the transgender question "are you boy or a girl?". The video talks of this happening previously to other people, is this true? Alex Jones tried blaming Obama Care for it, but I couldn't find a link to prove or disprove that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder why doctors are asking these kind of questions in the first place, seems kind of invasive if you ask me. General practitioners are not therapists or counsellors, so they should have no right to ask these questions.

             General practicians ascertain general health, why shouldn't they make sure everything is generally in order?

              How does asking if you have any guns in the house or pressuring young children into asking questions about their sexuality and their family members sexuality relate to anything remotely medical? As the lady said, she took her children for a basic checkup and even asked in advance if there would be any shots. It was a basic checkup meaning they check your; temperature, your weight, height and overall health. Then they ask you if you have had any concerns about anything and then send you on your way if everything is okay.

              I don't know if you even watched the video, but if you did, then you would know that this goes beyond a doctor being concerned or thorough. The lady also supposedly knows of people losing their kids for what sound like ridiculous reasons like "not socialising your children enough" which I will not comment on, as there is no proof this is the case nor could I find anything online. It was worrying enough for the mother who felt like she was being interrogated and one wrong answer means you might lose your kids. Nobody should feel like that seeing a doctor, especially not one you've been seeing for five years.

              The fact the husband called out the doctor on his actions via a communication platform provided to patients and the doctor responded he was making small talk and building a rapport, even though the doctor asked these questions at the end not the beginning which disprove his argument and shows the he is lying, is alarming in itself.

               There is a thing called HIPPA. If its considered medical records, then no one but you or the people you allow can see it. Guns are an issue for a kid life if they are mishandled. If there are guns in the house the doctor could make sure that the parent is using proper gun safety.

               As far as asking a kid about his/her gender; its a simple question to see if the child has a gender identity issue. If they answer the opposite gender that they physically are, the doctor can provide the necessary resources to deal with it.

               I think this is way more paranoia than conspiracy unless you think the government has access to all our medical records.

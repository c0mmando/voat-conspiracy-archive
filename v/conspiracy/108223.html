<p>The discussion finally led to me pointing out that Israel is committing genocide, which seemed to piss off the user, the way it does on many other forums, and a counter argument was made by the user that according to Google’s definition of genocide what Israel is doing to the Palestinians is not genocide. This is a counter argument that I have had to deal with many times in my life so I was prepared for it, and since it took me some time to put this together I thought I would provide the info for you guys so that when the same argument is made against you, you will have an appropriate response if you choose to use it. My reply was and has been on many other discussions like this as follows, to provide the definition of genocide as stated by the UN: </p>

<p>As well, it\'s obvious that you are a shill, and I do understand why you are doing it. It would be very difficult for me as well to admit that my people and my country are committing genocide, but you are. I\'m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but now that you know, what are you going to do about it? If you are a Zionist, now you cannot deny what you are doing, and if you are just a paid shill, then you know where you should go.</p>

<p>ps. Something special is going on VOAT, we\'re getting shills coming here now, which means that VOAT is on the radar of the same people that have taken over many other forums. Due diligence is now required on our part to prevent this virus from destroying this forum as well. </p>

            I find it kind of ridiculous that you immediately claim that this person is a "shill" just because they have an opinion different than yours. Not that I agree with them, I don't, but still. I think the chances are much, much higher that this was just a regular person who you happened to disagree with.

            Dismissing someone who disagrees with you as an apologist and a shill is just an ad hominem and reflects poorly upon you more than an indication of a paid agent of an agenda.

              It is a complex conflict and few see Hamas as a victim, they see it as a terrorist group.  So while you may disagree with his assertions, that doesn't make him idiotic.

            While many of the other comments here are debating whether shills are real, if they're on voat, or whether this was a shill or not, I'd like to comment on your response.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you did a decent job of responding to the claim that genocide is not occurring in Palestine. You cited a source that the common person would find undeniably reputable on the subject, made relevant quotations including the items delineated in the UN resolution mentioned by your source.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do want to address the first part of your quote, which i did not see in any of your linked sources, "As I stated, I do not..." Where is this quote from?

             Glad you noticed, that first part is from my own blog post. I put together this info because I've had to use it many times and it was worth archiving. Unfortunately though since VOAT does not allow any posts to be submitted from blogspot I didn't provide that link.
             <a href="http://chycho.blogspot.ca/2012/12/a-dinner-conversation-israel-and.html">
              Here it is
             </a>
             , not sure if VOAT will flag it though. You will be able to find the full post if you do a search for: "A Dinner Conversation: Israel and Armenia, Oppression and Genocides, Reality and Denials"

              Ah I see. If I were your editor, I would advise you mention that you are quoting something you've written elsewhere previously, and maybe consider removing the "as i stated, " section of that initial sentence to avoid confusion.

            Hi everyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't like lies. The use of the word genocide is untrue, emotionally manipulative, and a red herring for excusing Arab violence, and its consequences.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, I correct the lies. That does not make me a shill. Unless exposing lies is shill operation, as it might be for salvia.
           </p>
           <p>
            And to everyone else who has issue with Israelis defending their lives, I want you to do the following. Reread the history of the conflict but hold Arabs to the same standards as the Jews, and see if you still have a problem.

            I don't believe that the majority of the US is still pro-Israel, and I believe as time passes and the truth starts to filter more and more into the mainstream, more people are looking at Israel with disgust than anything else.
           </p>
           <p>
            A shill does not necessarily have to be paid (I haven't looked up the official definition). A pro-Israeli-shill could be someone who supports the Zionist agenda, and there are many of this group on forums. They have an organization specifically set up for that.

              I know some of these fanatics, I met some of them in the early days of the born again christian movement during the 1980's. They are just as bad as any religious fanatic, even worse is some aspects since they have some serious military hardware.

               I live in a VERY christian conservative area.  Some of these people are just nitwits.  I never met a creationist until moving here for example, they actually do exist and they will argue to the death that evolution is a fraud, science is our religion, and other nonsense all the while denying hard core proof about the age of the planet and dinosaurs.

             It's most definitely big enough. One of the things that matters most, that puts sites on the radar, is the growth rate, and VOAT is growing fast.

            I don't use the word "Shill" for everyone. Since I've had to deal with many of them, I'm usually pretty good at knowing who they are. They all have the same tactics and the same arguments, it's almost as if they are working from a handbook or something.

            I wouldn't be so quick to red-scare the threat of shills. Israel apologism is the narrative in the U.S. mainstream media, and its going to be the 'default' opinion for a lot of new people.

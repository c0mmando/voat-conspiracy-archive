             First, I gotta say... I just find it interesting. I don't really care that much, and there's nothing that can change it. The end goal is for elites to create a weak slave population that it can have FULL control.  Basically.. communism... a master controlling a dog. I wouldn't mind being in the elite... but you know.. hows that gonna happen..
            </p>
            <p>
             Where this plays a role is in movies they have the main character struggling and succeeding in the end. And everyone else usually dies or gets screwed over. The main character is the only one that succeeds. And if the main character never was introduced the other characters would of survived. Which is promoting communism. So long story, short, the idea is the same they gave to Russians during the early stage of communism 'those exceptional semi-rich farm owners screwed you over, go remove them'. In some ways it actually is the only thing that makes sense. One group controls everything, and the rest are bred to be docile. Everyone gets fed, and housed, and get along.

              Ok, that is a little clearer. I see where you are going...
             </p>
             <p>
              “Super hero worship, only the strongest can succeed and survive; but you, the common man, are powerless fodder, so you sheep had better just stay passive.”
             </p>
             <p>
              grammar note: NOT  “would OF survived”...  “would HAVE survived”
             </p>
             <p>
              In any case, you are trying to describe just one of the many existing brainwashing messages.

               I think it's more of a take out these 'defectors' and take out these 'bad apples'. Not literally 'take out' this time around, but its about not allowing bad apples to ascend. Again its the idea that there are some people willing to cheat the common man to ascend. Which I think was false back in the day, but now a lot of people are actually cheating the common man out of necessity of a crappy economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think its a new form of communism happening, a more advanced state of communism. Which imo I am seeing was always inevitable. From the time of kings and queens, and emperors there always and will always be on some level master and slave. So communism is basically a natural part of reality. And happens 100%.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only way to win is to be stealthily, and present yourself like the common man. The saying 'don't hate the player, hate the game' imo I think it means for smart people thinking about it is for winners to love the game, and hate the player. Rise to the top whether its getting good at something or making money, and do it stealthily as if you are just a lucky schmuck. And to stay at the top, you gotta be nice to those that are below.

              You must understand the leading Bolsheviks who took over Russia were not Russians they hated Russians, they hated Christians, driven by ethnic hatred they tortured and slaughtered millions of Russians without a shred of human remorse.
             </p>
             <p>
              It cannot be overstated, Bolshevism committed the greatest human slaughter of all time, the fact that the world is ignorant and uncaring about this enormous crime is proof that the global media is in the hands of the perpetrators."

             The desecration and destruction of Christian edifices across Europe resonates with Russia post the Jew inspired sham 1917 Revolution, where the emptying of churches was accomplished by the simply expedient of burning them down—thousands of them—and building synagogues.

            <p>
             Picture the WTC complex .. trials and executions are underway in response to the 911 attacks and the subsequent cover up, gallows are straining under the weight of US citizens who conspired with traitor Jews in carrying out the attacks.

             GWB's body is swinging beside Barak Obama's, Rummy is there dangling by his neck Giuliani is hangin' alongside, Condi has been beheaded in deference to good taste and human dignity, since oft times when a woman is hanged, her guts pops out from you-know-where!

            <p>
             Now we have come to the Jews who were warned and saved themselves to the tune of
             <a href="http://www.publiceye.org/frontpage/911/Missing_Jews.htm">
              so many thousands
             </a>
             , in response to which I have decided mass gassing is the most humane way of exing that many .. forty bulldozers and a hundred Mack trucks are waiting their engines idling, a glass walled gas chamber has been built.

            On the surface, it sure looks like retaliation for New Zealand, which I'm sill on the fence about ( they were awfully quick with the gun and 'hate' site bans). Today
            <em>

            </em>
            have been an accident, but I doubt it. I'm just observing, staying skeptical.

             There's plenty to consider for why Voat jumped to this conclusion: prior arrests of muslims planning to attack Notre Dame specifically, the other Islamic arson attacks on churches (check the number, it's ridiculous), Saint-Sulpice withstood an arson attempt thankfully, and it's the first day of Easter week.

            But that was my first thought, too, after the rumors of other churches burning in the recent past. Any feds trying to incite something will naturally latch on to that obvious idea, but the idea of fault itself may still be valid.

             It's just the same damn pattern, day in, day out.  Divide, divide, divide.  pit anyone v anyone else.  Literally anyone else.

             And it's not just the anti-muslim comments - it is straight out "do an individual action and kill muslims."  Just seems a bit more pointed today.  maybe i'm just too thentithive.

               I don;t recall saying anything about "mentioning" it, I was talking about promoting, direct, lethal action.  Almost as if it is an attemot to hope someone on here goes unhinged and shoots up a place so they can shut it down.

            It's islam and moslem's there sparky, 'arab', arabs are  a semitic people, originally from the Arabian peninsula and neighboring territories, inhabiting much of the Middle East and North Africa.
           </p>
           <p>
            The word 'islam' describes an religion/cult with followers called moslem's. It's a death cult with a thugocracy thrown in for fun.

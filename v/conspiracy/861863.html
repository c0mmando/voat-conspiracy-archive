             The desensitization against violence could be argued to have lead to this world we are in now- where people are just
             <em>
              fine
             </em>
             with the amount of people murdered by cops, killed by executive order drones without due process, blown up or shot to death in real or faux terrorism attacks, etc. but cannot handle words like "nigger" "faggot" or "whore."
            </p>
            <p>
             Whether or not you believe false flag events currently occur, they are proven to have existed in the past. I considered Greg Nicotero's interview on the Talking Dead a disclosure event, because they showed us part of the process that went into creating this hyper-realistic dummy. Again, use your imagination to what ends this could be used for bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly, everyone talks about "the end", the apocalypse, the mass depopulation being secretly planned...as if it means we, collectively, have lost. No. There is always hope. "Life finds a way." When the world falls, we will retake it, stone by stone, brick by brick, we will rebuild it to be better than it was.

              ok here goes...
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Most people never thought they would see the day that the FBI would become so politicized that many of its members actively lie and commit treason in an attempt to bring down the President of the United States, but alas, here we are.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              This is plainly begging the question, which sets the tone for the rest of the article.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               While our criminal justice system was originally established to give all Americans, regardless of their background and political ideology, fair and equal treatment under the law, that all changed when Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States. With the Department of Justice under his control, Obama was able to appoint radical leftists like Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch to do his bidding, which mostly consisted of race-baiting and using the law to specifically target conservative Americans. In this way, the justice system became not only entangled in rampant corruption, but also a weapon used by the left to destroy their political enemies.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              While its certainly true that Obama did not help the state of law in America, he surely is NOT the first president that disregarded civilian rights and the constitution. To say that Obama is in fact the cause is patently false and only serves to push his previous fallacious argument.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Today, even though Donald Trump has taken over Barack Obama’s seat inside the Oval Office, rogue Obama appointees that still reside in the Department of Justice are doing what they’ve always done; the only difference is that now they have the advantage of working to dismantle the conservative movement from within.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              From within? Those people by definition are not part of the conservative movement by virtue of the authors previous paragraph which described them as radical leftists. Those "rogues" have even less advantage today, I should only have to point to the IRS scandal in which conservative PACs were targeted. This would not be possible today.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Perhaps one of the most outrageous and desperate allegations made by the left in recent history is the idea that President Trump and various members of his team colluded with the Russians throughout the 2016 presidential election, which ultimately helped Trump defeat Hillary Clinton last November. Despite no concrete evidence whatsoever, the liberals, including and especially leftists within the mainstream media, have been hellbent on convincing the American people that something illegal occurred. Eventually, they were rewarded for their efforts with the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has gone on to conduct one of the most biased and politicized FBI investigations in American history.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              There are a lot of fallacies in this paragraph, on both sides of the coin of course. The main take away here is the last line. This specifically is simply the opinion of the author. "One of the most", based on what criteria? Did he examine ALL FBI investigations in American history? He simply linked to another suspicious article on some other ad-spam website.
             </p>
             <p>
              Following that he goes on to name a few FBI agents that have acted stupidly and improperly. This is nothing new nor does it reflect the whole of the FBI. Yes, the whole thing stinks of corruption, I am not arguing that. I am simply saying that this author is unqualified and unequipped to make these accusations. The article, as it stands, is trash.

<p>So before anyone talks about going full Rambo, let\'s consider what other options we have beyond just voting. What legitimate avenues have yet to be fully tried? Protest seems to be a difficult route based on what we learned from OWS. Much larger numbers are needed, and that may require a precipitating event that would have to arise naturally in order to organize the numbers and intensity necessary for any success with this approach. So perhaps this is not the way either.. </p>
<p>Talking about the US, it\'s clear congress has to be bypassed in order to enact any real changes. They will NEVER vote themselves in to a position of less power, and they don\'t seem to care about public opinion. This video outlines the problem extremely well, voting literally has zero impact on the behavior of congress if you\'re in the bottom 90% of the economic pyramid: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig</a></p>
<p>This video and the organization that made it (represent.us) suggests the solution is to focus on sorting out local and state governments, and then the effects will ripple upwards. They actually created legislation and passed it in the state of South Dakota by popular vote. Then immediately it was found unconstitutional and was repealed through &quot;emergency measures&quot;. Which sounds like bullshit on first glance, but the bill was actually created by Soros and Rockefeller organizations, as the donor page shows: <a href="https://represent.us/donor-list/">https://represent.us/donor-list/</a></p>
<p>The bill would\'ve maintained the existing government, changing nothing, and then put on top of it another layer (the &quot;ethics committee&quot;) that can fire anyone, and is appointed by the governor.  
</p>
<p>So while the anti-corruption bill by represent.us <em>seems</em> good on the face of it, the reality of the bill is that it was a power grab under the auspices of being an anti-corruption bill for the public good. The bill was opposed by the Koch Brothers. So you have the leftist billionaires vs the rightist billionaires, both pretending to act in the benefit of the people, both vying for power over state and local governments. </p>
<p>While this is scary, there is something positive that can be learned from what happened to the represent.us legislation. They were able to pass the legislation democratically by bringing the issue up for a public vote, instead of it being run through the traditional governmental machinery. This bypass can let people enact laws directly by voting on them instead of having to go through corrupt representatives. You know, actual democracy. </p>
<p>So what if we foisted represent.us on their own petard, and used the same approach to pass something that is <em>genuinely</em> anti-corruption?</p>
<p>Let\'s look at another example that we can learn something from: WolfPAC. WolfPAC is an organization started in 2011: <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com/the_logical_path_to_end_corruption">http://www.wolf-pac.com/the_logical_path_to_end_corruption</a> </p>
<p>It is a proposed federal-level anti-corruption bill that is trying to be passed via state resolutions that can trigger a national constitutional amendment. There is a little known rule, that can actually be a chink in the armor of the current power structure: </p>
<p>There are <em>two</em> ways to propose a U.S. Constitutional Amendment, as stated in Article V of the U.S. Constitution. </p>
<p>2/3 of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, OR</p>
<p>2/3 of the states (34 states) can pass a resolution that calls for a national convention to propose an amendment.</p>
<p>The ratification stage requires 3/4 of the states, 38 states, to vote in support of an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution, ensuring that it must have broad public support from the American people. </p>
<p>So using this mechanism, congress can be bypassed entirely. This could be the silver bullet, so to speak. I\'m not a huge TYT fan and they created WolfPAC, so I\'m not sure if I support their particular bill (it seems possible it is co-oped by billionaires in the very same way as the represent.us bill), but there is certainly something to be learned from their approach because it is a viable one. I say we learn from it and use it ourselves. </p>
<p>America is heavily divided an conquered, so proposing something that has broad support is difficult. It would have to be worded in a way that 3/4 of Americans approve of it, even in the face of twisted propaganda against it that would inevitably arise from the mainstream media. So it would have to be very simple, without a lot of extras or baggage, and very direct. As simple as it can be, but no simpler.</p>
<p>Then it has to be promoted. We can look to wolfPAC and represent.us for an example. They had slick media campaigns that obviously had high budgets, whereas any grassroots push would likely be done through volunteer work and have a low budget (unless there was huge kickstarter/patreon support for the project). The media presence would be the trickiest part, most likely. </p>
<hr />
<p>There are many many details to work out, but I believe this is a possible framework for a genuine peaceful revolution that could fix the problem at the root. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pass local and state bills and grow support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pass state resolutions one by one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amend constitution after 38 states agree to the resolution </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Congress gets cut out of the loop, and we fix our government. </p>
<hr />
<p>The amendment has to be simple to withstand criticism and gain support. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No more revolving door between industry/lobbying and regulatory positions, or at least a minimum of 7 years wait before going from one side to the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Campaign funding is the same for all candidates,  or at the least personal donations are strictly capped at $500. No more superPACs or business donations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congressional term limits of 2 terms. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The end, nothing else. Do you think 75% of America would agree to those 3 things? </p>
<p>Now it seems if a good bill could be written, proper buzz could be generated about it, and some state votes were called, with enough attempts it could be passed in enough states to amend the constitution. Or get the laws changed on the state level so the effects ripple upward. Both approaches can be used in tandem, the state bill can be a slightly modified version of the state resolution. </p>
<p>I\'ve been looking a long time for a path out of this political mess, and this may be the way. If you believe in the possibility of this approach, please spread the word and let\'s get started.</p>',

            Nice read. I don't think now is the time to act, because people don't know what they're doing. As long as people accept propaganda uncritically, they'll be brainwashed to the point that when they take action, it will just serve the agenda of the propagandists anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to say the first thing that needs to be done, is to educate everyone you can reach about propaganda and disinformation. People need to get into the habit of analyzing information and drawing their own conclusions, instead of accepting narratives serving someone else's agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once people develop the habit of scrutiny, then they're ready to be informed and educated. Not until people can develop understanding for themselves, without needing to be led by 'experts' or 'authorities', can they truly act on their own behalf.

             I agree completely with what you say. Most people are awash in propaganda the same way a fish is always in water: It might live its whole life without realizing it until it is outside the water for the first time.

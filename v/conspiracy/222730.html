            FPH was/is a ploy. It was meant to be censored on reddit to set the precedent of censoring legal but "offensive" ideas/discussion. Once the precedent is set, its easier to censor other dissenting opinions, and then others, and others.  I'd bet that the people in fph on voat are the same ones from reddit.

            Well, to bring this around so it's still on topic with the sub- I'd be weary of squatters who were around before you guys migrated.

            That's what I meant when I said 'own it', but you kept trying to make excuses for this guy and distancing yourself from him, you're a TEAM.  Stand together!  You brigaded the thread well, just get your talking points better next time ;-)  "This guy who modded this place before reddit booted us fucked this one up.  He forgot the migrated community is used to dealing with non-community members differently and he can be a bigger dick than a lot of us sometimes"  Y'all are going to be under a spotlight, you have to make your PR/damage controls easier for yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            So why would you guys stay there if this other dude doesn't appear to be in-line with the way you used to do thing?  Seems to me since you're all newish here anyway, starting your own sub shouldn't be out of the question if this guy's bringing heat to your doorstep.

            So I got mail indicating that this post had the appearance of being "brigaded". about 30 minutes old, only a few votes (2/2), but already 47 comments (this is definitely unusual) - most of them sounding a bit enraged at
            <a href="/user/mhtt">
             @mHtt
            </a>
            . We don't have any rules about brigading on this subverse currently or any policy for handling it. This post does appear to have an unusual amount of FPH fans present - and that's fine! I want to encourage you all to please not attack someone just because you disagree with them. Refuting ideas is fine - and desired! Lots of pathos or vitriol is not really desired on our subverse.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="/user/mhtt">
             @mHtt
            </a>
            , the fatpeoplehate subverse is a quirky beast, and as far as I'm aware they have a policy about removing comments critical of their activities or culture. I think it's dumb as hell and harms our site, but it's just the way things are. I've had some bad encounters with some of them outside of their subverse, making pretty despicable personal attacks on me for being critical of them, but
            <em>
             generally
            </em>
            they have been keeping to their subverse. They have their safe space, and I guess that's a good thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do think it's understandable that some of them would lash out at you for posting about it. Many people from that community/culture are kind of immature and very much driven by emotion and drama. So it is easy to see why they would follow you here to this post, or respond negatively to you on your
            <a href="/v/voat">
             /v/voat
            </a>
            submission. I don't think it's right, but it's understandable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know how to resolve the issues relating to that community injecting itself into our overall Voat.co community. The best I can suggest is to just do your own thing outside of their subverse, let them do what they will in that space. I'm sorry that you've had a bad experience here on
            <a href="/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            today, but hopefully it will be only a one-time thing.

             The only FPH fans that came in have been 3 of us mods who found the post being made about us after
             <a href="/user/mhtt">
              @mHtt
             </a>
             made the original post about their comment deletion on
             <a href="/v/voat">
              /v/voat
             </a>
             . We commented to let the individual know that a rookie mod had deleted the comment and we corrected the mod. We DO NOT have a policy to delete comments, we do not remove comments that don't break site wide rules. We do ban dissent however, as we keep things and the community hate focused. I have created
             <a href="/v/fphdiscussion">
              /v/fphdiscussion
             </a>
             for discussion about FPH philosophy for anyone that wants actual discussion however that's not the purpose of the main sub and our community likes us swinging the ban hammer.
            </p>
            <p>
             As you can
             <a href="https://slimgur.com/images/2015/07/09/4301e86f937d0d83d41cb0f16006759f.png">
              see I have not voated on this submission
             </a>
             , nor have I voated on any of OP's comments. I even upvoated their original post in
             <a href="/v/voat">
              /v/voat
             </a>
             in order to aid in visibility and our transparency. That's why I originally commented on the post, to publicly let them know what happened. The individual became combative and then made this post, so I showed up to make sure people would see what actually happened and understand the situation. I admit I also returned the user's combative attitude with my own and have promised to you not to let it happen here again.

             Hey thanks for writing the great reply. I appreciate your time and energy. I'm not upset, im entertained to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it's important to fight censorship in all it's forms and love having
             <a href="/v/conspiracy">
              /v/conspiracy
             </a>
             as a place to discuss these topics.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just wish such an active topic could see more eyes so we could better grasp how the community as a whole feels.
            </p>
            <p>
             seems kind of like more censorship when nobody can see a young debate this active ...
            </p>
            <p>
             thanks again for your time. peace :)

              You're right. I do think that a proper discussion about these issues should be had where more people can see them. It's unfortunate that this sort of downvoting to invisibility thing happens sometimes. Perhaps at some point we can do some sort of inter-subverse discussions, maybe an AMA or panel with mods from FPH to try and get a better handling on where everyone stands on these issues and what problems need attention.

            You have a mod who doesn't even know the rules for the community he's modding.  Own it, don't try to backpedal away from it.  That simple explanation goes a long way.

            Gotcha.  So you just have mods of your community without any idea how the community is run.  I'll spare you the sarcastic quip and just say thanks for clearing it all up for me.

            It's free for people to use, but then people like you abuse the powers given to fuel a petty idea. Voat was created for uncensored, unabridged, unadulterated content that
            <strong>
             is legal
            </strong>
            . You and your subverse have bastardized the idea of Voat, and showing how bad the problem really is by brigading us in two separate subverses from your own (because we can't post in yours).

             There is no post in our sub about it how's that possible? Making two posts about FPH mods in a site as small as voat, and even mentioning our usernames in one, and you think we would never see either?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Rules" are vague justifications for censorship now? Amazing. We'd all be better off moderators like those shown in this thread stopped with their own theocracies and ideas of how to run a subverse. You are still part of Voat, so
             <strong>
              <em>
               abide by the SITE-WIDE GOAL
              </em>
             </strong>
             , or you know make your own website and
             <strong>
              stop using other peoples hard work
             </strong>
             and ideas to fuel your own petty zealotry.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Censorship of any kind isn't allowed unless it is illegal content. If a subverse can ban people and delete comments for no good reason, then that subverse shouldn't have any upvoat/downvoat capabilities because its just a fucking garbage echo chamber circle jerk.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl;dr : Subverses can have their own rules as long as they don't violate Voat's main goal.

             So what you are saying is a subverse is in no way allowed to ban trolls/spammers because it isn't apart of the site wide goal. Are you people seriously retarded or something?

              Pointing out irony in a subverse should start a solid discussion. Not unquestioned censorship and banning. If pointing out irony qualifies as trolling/spamming, then why have a forum if you guys are just a glorified echo chamber?

              Edit: Furthermore, it's not hard to troll someone, especially after you get banned for no reason. You seem to want to curtail the problem, but didn't your mother ever tell you: "
              <strong>
               <em>
                Don't feed the trolls

               Because that is what the sub is about. We don't allow people who like fat people in a fat hating forum. Same with not allowing fat people. Why would we allow people who aren't for hating fat people to change the subverse's vision?

                I hate fat people as much as the next, I used to be an olympic athlete in swimming. But the brigading and "rules" of your subverse are the reason why Voat was created as an alternative to reddit. FPH got banned from reddit, and now you guys seem to not have learnt any lesson at all, and are censoring your page as you see fit - take a step back and actually use the voting system. Maybe have a really strict policy in FPH where if you get 5 downvoats it gets removed. One person holding the power to end someones line of discourse is unacceptable.

                 No, that's just incorrect. It has to do with reddit administration not one sub. Here subverses are still free to run their community as they want.

            Well, the FPH mods ARE censoring you, but the voat admins are not. You can see that there are deleted comments and each subverse has their rules, so stay away from those you don't agree with.

             how are we supposed to question are own thought and ideas? how are we to empathize and feel with others different from us if we shield ourselves from controversy?
            </p>
            <p>
             I say seek out all controversy and throw it into the brightest light for all to see!

              well, you may be right, comments shouldn't have a way to be deleted (unless if reported and verified as spam) and the mods should be dictated by the community... Like there could be some poll or
              <em>
               voating
              </em>
              system to change subverses mods. After all, we should be able to speak freely here. What do you think about suggesting it to the admins? (I WOULD upvoat, but I already reached my limit)

               it's just my first comment deleted in decades of using web forums and i think it's a little ironic the mods thought they could get away with it on voat. esp the FPH mods ahaha, It's kind of funny to me what people think they can get away with.... enjoy the site :)

            You must differentiate between subverse mod censorship and site admin censorship. If someone created subverse I think it's ok for him to set up some internal rules and enforce them. It's different from Reddit-style removal of something because it doesn't please site owners/CEO.

             then what's the point of the downvoat/upvoat mechanism if you just delete content based on a single users (mods) opinion?
            </p>
            <p>
             if you disregard the voat mechanism: voat no longer functions as a social media news aggregate and free speech platform, but more of a censored-hate-infested-circlejerk webforum.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is exactly why voat has mod logs so this bull shit doesn't happen. use the upvoat/ downvoat button likes its supposed to be used.

              Fatpeoplehate is a hate-infested-circlejerk webforum.  That is the point of it.  That is why the community was created both on reddit and on here.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Our aim is to build a site that serves the needs and wants of our users."
             </p>
             <p>
              The need and want of the user that created fatpeoplehate is to shit on fat people.  If you want to start a sub for open discussion on fat people, go right ahead.
             </p>
             <p>
              "While we don't necessarily approve or agree with all content that users submit to Voat, our policy is to not meddle and not censor content unless said content is illegal in Switzerland."
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, Voat's policy is to not censor.  Not the mods of a sub.  A sub can be set up however the creator wants it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm going to assume you are some idiot from SRS or SRD trying to start shit to "enjoy some popcorn."  You just come off as an idiot who can't tell the difference between the website itself censoring things and a subverse creating it's own set of rules that don't allow certain things.

               <p>
                Voat says the company itself is anti-censorship and therefore it does not censor anything legal and allows users to do what they want.
               </p>
               <p>
                The subverse does what it wants and creates it's own rules about what is considered on-topic.  This subverse has a rule that only fat hate is on topic.  So if you violate that, the sub can treat it how it wants.
               </p>
               <p>
                Try thinking of it like the government and a private company.  That's something you idiots love to preach about.  It is the same thing.

                 Your analogy is broken. You can't think of subverse as a private company, because Voat.co is still liable for anything that happens in a subverse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think of it more like the government and a branch of the government (Postal Service, etc). If a subverse is being shitty, then Voat.co gave them the tools to be shitty.

                  What does the liability of Voat have to do with it?  I am saying that just like the government cannot dictate what rules a private organization makes (as long as they are legal) neither can voat dictate (based on their own free speech stance) what rules a subverse makes as long as they are legal.

                   If when I post I get silenced, my rights are being violated - by extension if I can't even post at all then I have no Freedom of Speech. A corporation would be shut down and disbanded in America for pulling analogous shenanigans to FPH in the real world - why tolerate it here? I'm not asking for them to be removed, just give moderators more adept tools to actually moderate a topic or subverse, rather than dictating the entire outcome from the get go. (The way FPH runs thing is comparable to fundamentalist theocratic zealots).

                   Maybe rights don't apply the same way on the internet, and if that is the case then there should be a global internet charter of rights to uncensored, unabridged, unadulterated, legal content (

                    The point of Voat being free speech is that the users can create spaces however they want within the law.  How is that so hard to understand?

                     What you don't seem to understand, that although subverses are not managed by Voat,
                     <em>
                      they are a part of voat

                    <p>
                     By your logic, Voat could have all the promises to be free speech in the world, yet every subverse could be an echo chamber with no real discussion. What the hell is the point of a forum layout if you can't even put in two cents. Subverses like FPH that broadcast themselves as such should have a very different forum layout, more conducive to jerking each other off, and dissuading innocent people from trying to start a real discussion.

                      You are absolutely right, every subverse could be like that.  But the whole point of Voat is that if you want a subreddit with certain rules, you can fucking make it.  So if every subverse is like that, create your own fucking version of it that has the rules you want in it.  That is the fucking point.  FPH does have a different forum layout which is outlined in their rules that is conducive to exactly what you said.  So if you don't like the rules in that subverse, quit bitching and make your own.  They have the right to run their small portion of Voat how they want, just like you have the right to run any subverse you create how you want.  You dense fucking piece of shit.

                       Why all the derision? You can't seem to hold a cohesive idea in your head about where you stand on the position. Just because I don't agree with you, doesn't mean I'm a dense fucking piece of shit, it means I actually have a spine and you find that threatening - resorting to name calling because your infantile brain can't actually believe someone doesn't hold the same viewpoint as you. Gosh! Maybe give me a downvoat? What's the point of existing on a free speech platform if aren't willing to support free speech?

                        The derision was in response to yours.  I have a cohesive idea in my head of where I stand on the position, and it makes sense actually.  You are being willfully ignorant by refusing to acknowledge the differences between two distinct entities and the rules that govern them.  Voat is a free speech platform that allows users to create subverses that cater to their needs and desires.  That is free speech.  The subverses do not have to adhere to that individually since anyone that doesn't like the rules of a sub has the freedom to create their own in any way that they like.  I fully understand that a subverse is a part of voat, but each one has its own rules.  Voat's own FAQ: "Each subverse has its own rules which are stated in respective subverse sidebars. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally."  If you honestly can't see the difference between Voat as a platform and a subverse as an individually created community, there is no point in even talking to you anymore.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I don't find you threatening, and arguing with someone online doesn't mean you have a spine.  Hope you enjoy the feeling of your own hand on your back.

            deleting comments they don't like, HAHAHAHA!  They get banned from reddit and cry censorship, then don't even entertain "dissenting opinions".  Damn those mods really are shit-stains.  "We're here to help people, but we don't want to hear anything from people who don't agree!"  That's just sad.  Maybe they did deserve to get shafted off reddit- mods seem like a serious bunch of assholes.

            Seems there are plenty of ways to avoid this. They can dumb you down in their schools but you can still get access to good information not censored or repressed if you research. You don't have to eat their poisonous foods when there is plenty of alternatives. I could go on but mind control? No not if you are intelligent and a free thinker and avoid the pitfalls.

            This doesn't have to be about a certain transmitted frequency that makes people so fearful that they kill themselves, or lash out and commit crimes out of desperate anxiety. Although that's a thing reported in Popular Science years ago as a military prototype. (I don't call this "mind control" I call it "mind influencing".)
           </p>
           <p>
            People, some more than others, are just more influenced by the media in all forms. Repeat a message often enough and it becomes true. But the most feeble-minded people are much more influenced by repeated fake news, so they are more at risk. This includes those unable to stop consuming media, unable to rationally analyze the situation, those unable to get both sides of the story and thoughtfully process them, and those who don't act, but simply react with emotions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sound like a familiar group lately? A group who has been smashing windows, burning cars, beating up people, and being petulant, intolerant, reactive children?
           </p>
           <p>
            But a population must be weakened first.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Remove the ability to think and analyze. The US public schools did a great job at this. The Political Correctness movement had a big part in this. The book "1984" was a warning.
            </li>
            <li>
             Create anxiety and fear. This was at least a 2-prong effort.
             <ol>
              <li>
               Create helicopter parents who make sure the child cannot fail, and make sure they cannot learn to get back up again. Studies show anxiety and depression are the highest in the Millennial generation.
               <a href="https://rawdata.miraheze.org/wiki/Millennials">
                Some studies here
               </a>
               .
              </li>
              <li>
               Poison the food and water to mess with their mind. Endocrine disruptors are everywhere in the water and likely come from the phthalates in plastic. Studies already show how this affects people and it's really bad.
              </li>
             </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
             Make people physically sick so they can't fight back. Pesticides in the food system all over the world are doing a good job at this. Again, there are plenty of studies about this from good universities. But the healthy food industry has been attacked and devalued by putting too much hyperbole in its news.

            Blanket offense, sick inhumane pharmaceuticals and antagonistic legal frameworks on the masses, but high value targets will be assigned an appropriate dose of firepower to counteract or convert into an asset.

           <p>
            In other words, any organization has finite resources, they can not have one person or tool to fight/control every single human being. The bad agents (to hide crimes against humanity) would have to selectively prioritize then target individuals, as they would quickly run out of resources to maintain/grow their inhumane programs.

            Look, friend, I am going to try not to judge too heavily here, but I think you are interpreting chakras too literally.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are not a LITERAL row of 'locks' running down the center of your body, in fact many of the chakras are placed over spots through which there is very little bio-energy. When meditating, one can clearly feel that there are 'entry/exit nodes' on the feet and hands through which LARGE amounts of energy (potential, kinetic, biochemical, thermal) are constantly passing. On a purely thermodynamic scale, your hands and feet are the second largest sources of heat gained/lost (your head is the first largest)
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the hands and feet are not chakras. Why? Because chakras are a made-up concept. Take the 'heart' chakra for example; of course this is the chakra 'responsible' for energies promoting 'love, emotion, and passion'. This makes no sense whatsoever. Love, emotion and passion come from your  BRAIN. All of the things that are described in ALL the chakras (except the stomach chakra) are things that come from your BRAIN.
           </p>
           <p>
            I definitely understand that unless you know and love yourself and have a clear mind, the truth can destroy you. However, sending people on some spiritual scavenger hunt to 'open all of their chakras' is not a way to promote clear minds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Minds based in reality are the clearest.

             I won't speak on the matter anymore but if you choose to discuss this with me more then I'll discuss with you. I wont run from anything I post. like I mentioned before if you want to get technical "this is unmarked territory" different people have different experiences my purpose was to stop people who haven't ordered well themselves from trying to look into the other realms. I think you're right and wrong about what lies in the mind. I never said they were anything other than steps or powers: 'the third eye'. I'm rambling and ill shut up, I haven't unlocked anything but I've seen things and I could be wrong ABSOLUTELY wouldn't be the first time but this is how we learn. I didn't post for me I posted hoping to reach out to people like me.

             Well I can't because there are a ton of different information sources and I dont know which one is best. BUT. Just look up 7 chakras and you'll find it. Uhhhh basically you just start with the root chakra that's the first one. Now if I can make a suggestion there's the 7chakras / 7 stages of the ( personal favorite) Alchemy of transformation ( The Great Work ) and The 7 Planes of Existence. I've found that all of these are intertwined with one another. I hope you find what you're looking for.

            I'll take your spiritual words and try to make sense of them. From my perspective, if you try and look at the world with balance and objectivity, without first opening your mind to new possibilities, the horror of truth may break you down and destroy any chance of enlightenment you might have had. The unprepared mind will recoil and defense mechanisms will shut down your rationality.  Before one can become truly aware, one must first eliminate the egotistical desires of the flesh. Truly impossible for most mortal humans.

             In simpler terms the OP made me think of people getting "redpilled" about the true nature of the world too quickly, and how it makes them crazy instead of more sane.

              yea it makes sense. For example, a guy who makes his entire living building oil sands infrastructure is going to have a hard time believing that climate change is a problem. Such cognitive dissonance would drive even the strongest mind to drugs, alcohol, mass media, and escapism generally.
              <br/>
              But I have a feeling OP would say that's too simplistic. Perhaps...

             You're 100% right but I FEEL like your reply was just a tad bit out of place or went over my head. We have the innate ability to bring things into reality now if you successfully induced a astral experience or what have you your true self or subconscious has most of the control. Meaning if you have internal issues you haven't dealt with they WILL by manifested by you which goes back to what you stated. I want you to talk to you we just have to get on the same page.

             Thank you but all im saying is there's a process. The third is way more than just acquiring wisdom. You're unlocking a power. You go from step zero to step six and tell me how that works out. Lol you've gotta be kidding me hows about you skip the middle man and go straight to the 7th the Crown chakra

            Oh damn, yes, I definitely want to hear about this. Fascinating thinking to not just go for opening 3rd eye without serious prep.

             I used to hang out in EWAO (Earth We Are One) facebook group alot when it first went up. I believe when that happened conspiracy and spirituality reached never before seen heights. For the first time they found middle ground on a massive scale. For the first time they "became mainstream". They became trends. Everyone just wanted to open their third eye but not alot actually knew (along with myself) the ramifications of doing it without going through the COMPLETE process which is activating the previous chakras. Doing so could very well leave you open to "malicious entities" exploiting a opening. The root chakra itself is a GROUND. Just think about how important that one chakra is. The heart chakra is your protection.

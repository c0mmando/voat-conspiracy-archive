            They're proving vaccines are causing brain damage, so this all makes sense to me cause they hit such a huge part of the population so willingly and way too young.

            Weak minds are cultivated. If you raise your children properly, they will be strong minded. Its why public schools are so insidious, they
            <em>
             produce
            </em>
            the chattle that the masters want. We aren't born that way.

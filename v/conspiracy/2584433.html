            Their madness is born out of ancient misinformed rituals, that believed Jupiter to be some sort of satanic sun god, and that you had to sacrifice babies in order to please these gods.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's interesting that I stumbled upon these things from a completely different perspective, namely the Electric Universe theory. This theory along with their archaeological findings seems to indicate that our solar system had a very different configuration a long time ago. This was a time when Jupiter and Mars were prominent planets in our night sky, and because of their proximity it produced all kinds of cataclysmic events for the earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was during these times (some 15,000-30,000 years ago), that these ancient myths and rituals formed. The people thought the gods were angry, and out of this mayhem all the satanic and planet worshiping cults evolved.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you can say in summary, is that all these elites that think they are performing some ancient secret powerful rituals, are all really following a fairy tale story from a time when humans did not yet understand planetary movement, astronomy and the reason for the cataclysmic planetary events.
           </p>
           <p>
            To put it bluntly; the "power" the elites think they obtain, is actually born out of ancient ignorance.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I just put a disclaimer that this is just a loose theory I've stringed together from bits and pieces so far. If you want to follow my footsteps and see if it makes sense for yourself, then you could start by watching the "Discourses on an Alien Sky"-series from the Electric Universe Thunderbolts Project here:

             are you fucking retarded? the solar system is 4.6 billion year sold, and you think jupiter's and mar's orbits changed dramatically in 10,000-15,000 years? holy shit what an idiot

              There is archaeological evidence that our solar system was not configured the same way for all these 4.6 billion years. It's been predicted by many scholars, for example Immanuel Velikovsky. The history of our solar system is not set in stone by our dogmatic modern science. We have evidence that there were several cataclysmic events on earth in our near history, that are not explained by modern science even today. This implies something has happened to the earth not predicted by our current understanding. The theory and explanation is all in the video series.

               im not gonna sit through 30 fucking youtube videos of nonsense. you can explain to me how jupiter and mars magically shifted into new stable orbits over 10-15,000 years, or i will continue to believe what math and physics as well as astrological observations of other solar systems tells us.

                I don't know everything, but the EU theory postulates the orbits are stabilized not only by gravity, but also by electric potential. Conventional cosmology only takes gravity into account, but EU also recognizes that we have electric, and therefore also magnetic forces at play. This could account for much faster stabilization of orbits than standard theory would assume.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll just give an example of a recent discovery by main stream science:
                <br/>
                <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-06-magnetic-fields-key-star-formation.html">
                 https://phys.org/news/2018-06-magnetic-fields-key-star-formation.html
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                This was posted in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/science">
                 /v/science
                </a>
                just a day ago. They are already starting to recognize magnetism in astronomy, and where magnetism exists, there must exist electric currents and electric fields, because one cannot exist without the other.
               </p>
               <p>
                However I am not an EU expert by far. So that's as much information you will be able to squeeze out of me. But I'm quite sure that the electric nature will only become more main stream as time goes by. Juno is already discovering several unexpected "anomalies" around Jupiter, which could be electrically related. So stay tuned...

                 i see why you believe this now, you lack a fundamental understanding of electricity and magnetism.

                <p>
                 i typed up a long ass reply to another guy asking me how we know the solar system is 4.6 billion years old, and he deleted his reply before i could post it, so i don't really feel like doing another long explanation. suffice to say, magnetism cannot possibly change the orbits of mars and jupiter so drastically in such a short amount of time. i'd say electromagnetic fields have no affect on planetary orbits at all, seeing as how the planets have neutral charge.

                  I know how magnetism works. It follows the inverse cube law. But to say that our solar system is electrically neutral is very likely not correct, and this is one of the ideas of EU.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We already know for certain comets are not electrically neutral. The dirty snowball theory has been shattered by the latest discoveries, and we now know they are in fact solid rocky bodies. Because of this, the current consensus science still cannot explain the comet tails for example, because they cannot be melted snow and ice as was previously thought. Hint: the tail likely consists of electrically accelerated particles instead.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But I'm not the right guy to pour out your hate towards this idea. I'm not an EU scientist. Instead look up one of the EU scientific board members, like Wallace Thornhill, and send your questions him. You will get much better traction.

                   if we ignored what our ancestors learned we would have to rediscover everything for ourselves every generation. the only way to progress technologically is to build upon what our ancestors knew. there is no data to suggest what anything you've said is true.

                   i never claimed the solar system is electrically neutral, i said the planets are. but most large bodies are electrically neutral because of the way electrons act

                     This ground-breaking discovery suggests that the Pillars have evolved due to the strength of the magnetic field and that the Pillars are held up thanks to magnetic support, suggesting that stars could be formed by the collapse of clumps of gas being slowed down by magnetic fields, and resulting in a pillar-like formation.

            A decent rundown of his background:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             LinkedIn:
             <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethrich1">
              https://www.linkedin.com/in/sethrich1
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             LinkedIn indicates both Python and SQL experience, and based on his background R would not be a far fetched skill for him to have. It could also be possible for him to have access to the mail server's database AND admin access to the server. Admin access is required for some reporting and analysis tools.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Yep, "Data Director" would definitely entail programming knowledge and access to sensitive stuff like email databases.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not one for conspiracy theories, but holy shit does this look suspicious.

            And then we have this quote from Hillary, conveniently politicizing his death:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Just this past Sunday, a young man, Seth Rich -- who worked for the Democratic National Committee, to expand voting rights -- was shot and killed in his neighborhood in Washington. He was just 27 years old," she said. "Surely we can agree that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America."
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone know more about this?? I need to get to sleep now, will try to dig around some more tomorrow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doing some googling I found this info, make of it what you will:
The Russian connection below is what is intriguing. Doing some google-fu I found a strange article on a pro-hillary site truthorfiction.com claiming a propaganda piece was put out by Russia claiming the DNC staffer was murdered by a hit team then caught. I also found related Google news articles on a shooting around the same day.
           </p>
           <p>
            As per his Seth Rich's LinkedIn Apparently he was a programmer. He worked with databases. So many people's votes didn't count because they were switched from Democrat to independent "mysteriously".
           </p>
           <p>
            Could he have been the person tasked to do the database changes and now his loose end be tied up by his murder? The heat was on after all the vote fraud allegations and he knew too much.
           </p>
           <p>
            "While robbery has been cited as a motive in Rich’s death, it’s still not clear why he was murdered. His parents told the Inquisitor that if it was an attempted robbery, his attacker had failed since Rich still had cash on him when he was found."
           </p>
           <p>
            His LinkedIn:
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            "The sad story of Seth Conrad’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them.
           </p>
           <p>
            A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place.
           </p>
           <p>
            There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights.
           </p>

            Hit team article:
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            This is an article the day after Seth Rich was murdered. Could this be the hit team discussed? Wow. This is some deep shit.
Other notable things:
           </p>
           <p>
            -That Russian propaganda piece strikes me as odd. Go read it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could this be why we keep hearing about Russia with regard to the DNC Leaks? Are they afraid evidence is about to be dropped discussing this kids murder?
           </p>
           <p>
            -wikileaks dropped hints about this, do they have proof??
           </p>
           <p>
            -Working for campaign staff of Nebraska DNC he lists "Implemented persuasion &amp;amp:amp:amp:amp:amp:amp:amp:amp:amp:amp: opposition based strategies".
           </p>
           <p>
            -He also lists SQL in his skill set, flipping voter registrations would require knowledge of SQL. LOOKUP SQL QUERY.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Official report claims robbery yet nothing was stolen. Two shots to his back.
           </p>
           <p>
            -Official report states bruises on hands, face and knees potentially show signs of struggle but after some googling of the bruising pattern, can also show signs of being shot in the back and falling to your knees and then face first to the ground.

            <p>
             i mentioned this in another thread. i made a remark about how sad it was for this guy to die young and mentioned there would prob be no more gucci2 leaks. the next morning the Hill ran a piece talking about new leaks so i looked at the gucci2 page. no update. i mentioned this to the guy who also saw the hill piece. because i thought it was weird to change tactics by going to the press first. couple hours later, it's up on the gucci2 wordpress page. i then remarked that guccifer must be a redditer. since then there has been another release to the press but not the wordpress page. and shortly thereafter the wikileaks drop. imo, rich's death marked the time to release the data to the public. here's the link to that thread

            You can see how these True Or False sites really are bought when it comes to politics. Snopes and the site below basically say it's false because it's "Russian propaganda". Really makes you see why they are pushing the Russian propaganda angle so hard on MSM. NOTHING TO SEE HERE FOLKS!

            "The sad story of Seth Conrad’s death took a turn in state-sponsored Russian media. The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, issued a propaganda piece that reported Hillary Clinton or her campaign had been connected to Conrad’s death, and that the FBI had “captured” them.

            A somber Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that a top American Democratic Party staffer preparing to testify against Hillary Clinton was assassinated this past Sunday during a secret meeting in Washington D.C. he believed he was having with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents, but who turned out, instead, to be a “hit team”—and who, in turn, were captured yesterday after a running gun battle with US federal police forces just blocks from the White House.

            According to this report, SVR “electronic specialists” performing counter intelligence “missions/operations” noted on 7 July an “enormous/gigantic” increase of computer and telephonic traffic between the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington D.C. and the Clinton Foundation (CF) offices in New York City.

           <p>
            Upon a “deeper/broader” investigation into this “odd/strange” increase in communications between these believed to be separate organizations, this report continues, SVR analysts determined that the original initiating person responsible was a 27-year-old DNC official named Seth Rich who was that political organizations Deputy Director Data for Voter Protection/Expansion who had helped develop a computer program for the Democratic National Committee allowing people to type in their address and get a map to their polling place.

            There’s been no indication that Seth Rich’s killing was related at all to politics or Hillary Clinton in particular. And the idea that he was a “top” Democratic Party official is false. Rich was a 27-year-old who worked as the voter expansion data director at the DNC. In that role, he fought for voters’ rights

             I lost respect for them once I read their explanation of how Obama got 100% in certain districts. Their response was: "Well, if you would just look at the districts, it would make sense!!!" What an in-depth explanation.

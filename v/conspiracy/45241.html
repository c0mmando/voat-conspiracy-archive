             Couldn't agree more. The premise and theories presented in this OP are some of the most moronic shit I've read in the past 72 hours. (I hang around on infinite chan)

             So Hitler's master plan was to enslave the planet economically and allow multiculturalism, political correctness and deneracy dominate?

              <p>
               I'm against central banking and usury and see it as the biggest nail in the coffin of the west. The reason why I ask what you're getting at is because your typing style is disorganized and difficult to understand. I was just looking for some clarification, man, no need to snap at me.

            Hitler would be mortified at the state of modern Germany.

            Sucked dry by rampant capitalism, under the close watch of Jewish politicians.

            Modern Germany isn't good, but national socialism sure as hell isn't the problem.

             lets review...politicians, ie politics, is dictated by the tv...the tv is owned by the bankers and their corporate divisions...so the banks use the tv to put "politics" in charge...and before that it was the radio, and before that it was the papers...
            </p>
            <p>
             when you run a gang, you don;t build headquarters and have the boss sit in the boss chair....no you create a false "authority" to sit in the boss chair....that way the false authority will legitamize the crime....and at the same time gives cove to the true leaders as dumbfounded dipshits will "go after" the "government" decoy....which is exactly what happens....stupid people get mad, they blame "government"....as intended by your true leaders

            A person, that being you, who "steers" people towards the perspective of looking at the world related to countries, political groups is questionable. You either have no concept that all countries, all leaders going back to 1694 are merely diversions that steer one away from the obvious truth that money and he who creates it are and have always been in charge....
           </p>
           <p>
            You sound like one of those people who does not understand that all elections are controlled, all leaders put in place are put there using the central bankers media, and that once in "charge" "leaders" serve the central bankers....and or the small group of people that have for centuries suckerd you dumb assholes into THINKING that your government create your currency for you at a "reasonable" rate...the "Nazi's" as you would call them....were one of the few groups of people who stood against usury...at least ideologically....the entire "Nazi party" was infact a central banker controlled opposition operation that would subject the "Jews" to the "wrath" of the Nazis, when it is a fact that a few "Jews" who are gangsters ultimately did this to their entire race in order to perpetuate a long standing smokescreen that could be used to prop up the usury scam via confusion...Proof that Hitler was in with the central bankers is that he   was scurried off to Argentina where he died of old age, he did not commit suicide, he was "protected"  and hidden

           <p>
            Only when humanity understands monetary systems and money at its point of inception and understands that it is a crime and that "you" all of you are the victims, will you see who your true enemy is...

              I'm not the one espousing the ideology that "governments" are in charge, historically it's called a Hegelian dialectic, as I'm sure you know... and actually the "you calling me a shill because we have a difference of opinion" thing is used way more by shills than anything I'm doing....explain your rational and intent behind it...Central banks run the show, not "nazi's"

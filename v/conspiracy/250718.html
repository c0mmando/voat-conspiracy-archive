            It's against the law in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial">
             many countries

           </p>
           <p>
            The "Truth" - and the basis of many of these laws - is what was declared as such during the Nuremberg trial just after the end of the war. From a scientific point of view this is an absurdity considering how many years of historical work are normally necessary to get any kind of reasonable sense of what happened during a certain event.

             too true. When scientific evidence is suppressed and those that question are gaoled or silenced, then there is obviously a cover up.

             Not to mention the truth fears not the light of investigation.    If what they say about the Holocaust is true it wouldn't be illegal to question it in so many countries.

            An entire up-market magazine in Japan,
            <em>
             Marco Polo
            </em>
            , was forced to close down because it ran an article, that they had researched for five months, saying there was no gas used at Auschwitz.
           </p>
           <p>
            The following is from Wiki
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Japan">

            :
           </p>
           <p>
            In February 1995 a magazine named Marco Polo (マルコポーロ), a 250,000-circulation monthly aimed at Japanese males, ran a Holocaust denial article by physician Masanori Nishioka (西岡昌紀) which stated:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The 'Holocaust' is a fabrication. There were no execution gas chambers in Auschwitz or in any other concentration camp. Today, what are displayed as 'gas chambers' at the remains of the Auschwitz camp in Poland are a post-war fabrication by the Polish communist regime or by the Soviet Union, which controlled the country. Not once, neither at Auschwitz nor in any territory controlled by the Germans during the Second World War, was there 'mass murder of Jews' in 'gas chambers.'"[22]
The Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center instigated a boycott of Bungei Shunju advertisers, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Cartier. Within days, Bungei Shunju shut down Marco Polo and its editor, Kazuyoshi Hanada, quit, as did the president of Bungei Shunju, Kengo Tanaka.[23]

            In October 1999 a Japanese publication, The Weekly Post,  published a story on the proposed acquisition of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan by Ripplewood Holdings, which the article described as being "Jewish":
           </p>
           <p>
            "The strong will of Jewish finance capital, which prides itself on its enormous power and covers the world's financial markets like a fine net, was behind the buyout of LTCBJ. It is not hard to imagine that the offensive of Jewish finance capital will intensify the cutthroat struggle for survival among companies brought on by the 1997 Asian financial crisis."[24]
This soon generated strong complaints by Jewish groups, particularly outside of Japan. The Weekly Post quickly retracted the article and carried an apology on its home page. The publication explained its error by noting that "the problem stemmed from the stereotyped image of the Jewish people that many Japanese people have."[13]

              And you as well. The second part, about the Weekly Post, is somewhat irrelevant, but I'm particularly interested in suppression of the media in Japan. For example, not many outside Japan, and many inside, know that the Japanese Government officially announced a media ban on news about Fukushima, unless the news comes via the government. The ban went into effect about six months ago and now there is virtually nothing on the subject in Japanese news. But I'm edging further into irrelevancy.

             The parent company, Bungei Shunju, was apparently threatened with an organized Jewish boycott. The company president subsequently apologized for the article, closed down the magazine, fired the responsible staff members, and recalled and destroyed any remaining copies of the issue.

            Well, if you are going to bring peer reviewed science to the table, then that is cheating. And yes, you are right in regards to no pits. Pits (especially burning or burial) leave a wonderful archaeological footprint which is impossible (literally) to conceal. No pits have ever been found. That is simply because there where no "death camps".

             Also, it's impossible to light a pile of bodies on fire - there is too much water.  Also in a pit, no air has a chance to feed/fuel the fire from beneath.  Also, bones would remain.

             Yes. Some camps in particular were the site of many unfortunate deaths, but the evidence doesn't support the claims of intentional extermination programs. I should add that I don't think the Schläpfer study was peer-reviewed, nor Mattogno's article. Although his analysis is on the more technical end of the spectrum for Holocaust historiography, it's basic and transparent enough that review isn't really necessary -- primary sources are still the key. (Note too that the English translation of Mattogno's enormous book-length study of cremation at Auschwitz-Birkenau has just been released, but is not yet available for free download.)

              Thanks for that. I wish i spoke German better than I do. I Agree that the Schläper study may not of been peer reviewed, he was however a Phd and co-author of other papers. I would suspect that at the least, he would of had colleagues peruse it. (i have been looking hehe) I also agree that basic engineering/technical articles do not need to be reviewed, especially when they are dealing with a fairly mundane engineering topic. Thankyou for the link to Mattongo's book. It reads well, (sofar) and chock full of primary reference material.

            took to center stage in the press well-researched investigative journalists along with portions of the general public who did their due diligence began to realize that “crisis actors” or “role-players” were being used by the mainline press to trick the sheeple.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the main objectives of the psychological operations, both the Sandy Hook school shooting and the Boston Bombing, were to instill fear upon the citizenry, offering the Powers-That-Be a chance to capture that fear and turn it into control, thus paving the way for more gun laws, restrictions, and the over-policing of the American people.

            Now, and to no surprise, a company named
            <a href="https://www.linxxglobal.com/company.html">
             Linxx Global Solutions, Inc.
            </a>
            is soliciting “role-players” to satisfy a Department of Defense (DoD) contract in Boston from Sept 10-23 overlapping the tail end of
            <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/?s=jade+helm">
             JADE HELM 15
            </a>
            which officially is set to end on Sept. 15.
           </p>
           <p>
            The solicitation was sent by Don Adams, retired U.S. Navy veteran and current Project Coordinator for Linxx Global Solutions, Inc., according to Linkedin, to various independent contracts through their agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            The solicitation provided to me by my source reads as follows:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Good afternoon, I am looking for some potential role players from 10-23 September.

            The following is a public summary of Don Adams career as posted on Linkedin:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Retired February 1st, 2015 from Th U.S. Navy completing 26 years of faithful, honorable and committed service to the Naval Special Warfare Community.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Although I am not insinuating that anything other than what Adams listed in the solicitation will occur, my sources and myself think the nature of the solicitation is important to note — just in case.
           </p>

            Remain vigilant.

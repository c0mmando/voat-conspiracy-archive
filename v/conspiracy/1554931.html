            Appeal to youth. I've seen the original less-shitty Missing Links but this just ads  beat to it. IMO it's a documentary worth cross-referencing with other sources. It's not a secret Israel Jews have been responsible for false flags, but it's important to consider the Governments or criminal organizations that held hands in these events.

            I like Bollyn's work because it's entirely independent and focused on 9/11, and he was an investigative journalist working in Israel and the middle east when 9/11 happened. He was later terrorized by state police for his efforts in reporting his knowledge, and is probably lucky to be alive.

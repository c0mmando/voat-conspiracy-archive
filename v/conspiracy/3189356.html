   I've long thought global warming was a scheme to implement a world wide tax but this week I've come to believe there is a far more sinister reason it is being pushed by the globalists.

            I think it will also be a means to slow opposition. Imagine a huge rally or a political gathering of a certain group of people. Permits can be pulled and the rally shut down based on the amount of CO2 that the group of people is producing.

            Whether globalists realize what they are doing or not, the effect of pushing a reduction in global CO2 would be smaller food crop yields, and millions of deaths by starvation. CO2 pumped out by India and China is helping to feed the world. We are currently starved for CO2, in an geological context. In past ages the CO2 has been much greater, and the plant growth has been more lush, with fewer desert regions.

            While I do agree there are a lot of Luciferians involved at the top that want depopulation I think they're being obstructed by the mid level players who just want the money and power.  They don't want depopulation since it would hurt their cash cow.

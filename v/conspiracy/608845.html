<p>Imagine going about your life, and one day you notice that you\'ve been starting to get a statistically disproportionate number of wrong number calls on your phone. Nearly all of your neighbors suddenly get louder, even purchasing equipment (leaf-blowers, basketball gear for the driveway, car alarms and whatever else they can think of) that all has one thing in common - it\'s loud - and they use it all hours of the day... even regularly taking shifts so that there\'s no peace and quiet from early morning till late at night. Traffic spikes sharply upward right outside your door, and people are always parking right outside, slamming their car doors, and chirping their brand spanking new car alarms that they suddenly all decided to rush out and get.</p>
<p>When you go out, there seem to be more people around you on the street than usual. Wherever you go, strangers around you begin coughing more often. Clearing their throat around you more (&quot;heh-HEMM!&quot;) unnecessarily loudly... and about once a minute. Statistically improbable numbers of total strangers around you whistling mindlessly - and tunelessly. The volume of strangers talking and laughing around you goes way, way up. In public, people in your peripheral vision seem to make a point of shaking their legs, tapping their feet, and even crossing their legs and jiggling their raised foot frenetically at the ankle... so that whatever you\'re doing, they break your concentration. People around you gesticulating wildly in conversation and even slapping themselves on the thigh repeatedly, hard enough to produce a really loud slapping noise, and continuing their conversation as if totally unaware of it.</p>
<p>Many of the people you encounter and have to deal with in public life get ruder and ruder, and strangers around you start getting into loud arguments with each other wherever you go, while others will start interrupting you for seemingly normal reasons (&quot;Do you know what time it is?&quot; &quot;Do you know how to get to ___ ?&quot;) but it will be a sharp increase beyond what is statistically normal... and day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, this bizarre jackassery just keeps happening.</p>
<p>This is organized stalking, and targets of it encounter scenarios like this every day. What would ordinarily be &quot;lifes normal breaks&quot;, or simple bad luck, or encountering the occasional rude or thoughtless person instead reach a level that is too high to be explained in terms like that.

            Bush Sr. and some others were involved.  I recall some former agents talking about how they were sent from Florida(?) without details of the mission, and some went back when they heard what it was.

            Found this, looking for “H. Theodore Lee”:
           </p>
           <p>
            Tippit killed Kennedy
           </p>
           <p>
            This one really ticks me off. The U.K. Daily Mail reported that an FBI informant “identified Dallas police officer J.D Tippit as the actual killer of John F. Kennedy.”
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the informant, H. Theodore Lee (sic) told him that Tippit was the head of the John Birch Society in Dallas and met with Jack Ruby and possibly Oswald at Ruby’s nightclub.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the author of the 2013 book, With Malice: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Murder of Officer J.D. Tippit,” I can assure you that this report is hokum from start to finish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Had anyone bothered to double-check the allegation, they would have found that the “H. Theodore Lee” was actually Vincent Theodore Lee – who aficionados of the assassination story will recognize as the head of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) in New York, the same organization Oswald claimed to have been secretary of in New Orleans and who Oswald had written to in 1963.
           </p>
           <p>
            In April, 1964, attorney Mark Lane, the self-appointed defense counsel for Oswald, was peddling a story that Bernard Weissman, J.D. Tippit, and Jack Ruby met in Ruby’s nightclub shortly before the assassination. The story turned out to be hooey, but not before Lane managed to get several left-wing publications, including The Guardian, to print stories about the allegation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former FPCC head, Lee, read the accounts and was repeating them to an FBI informant.
           </p>
           <p>
            In an April 6, 1964, FBI memo, released in July 2017 and included again as part of the October release, the FBI noted the similarities between Lee’s claims and the allegation being slung around by Lane.

            Again, a few clicks, and you’d have the answer to this false Tippit allegation.

             Yeah, I've heard accounts from people who attended conferences that Lane is a bad guy. And I'm no fan of the media or the average arm-chair investigator. So it doesn't surprise me the claim of Tippit being an assassin is hogwash. My point was to remind people of this visual similarity "coincidence."

              I’m by no means an expert, just read this and that over the years. I thought maybe Lane was one of the ‘good guys’. Here it sounds like he was pushing his Tippet-did-it theory to absolve Oswald.

            It’s conceivable they needed a body double for the autopsy. That’s the theory I heard.

<p>--</p>
<p>Doing some thinking and running a few ideas that aligns with information I have researched I am starting to think that there will be some sort of larger connection to events arising around the New Madrid fault line. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>First, I will start off by including the following <a href="http://i.imgur.com/G9wCi0H.jpg">graphic</a></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>It depicts a map (recreated) that was released by the USGS this year forwarning of possible earthquake risk/activity. Underneath it is a reading that was recording by Edgar Cayce prior to his death in 1945. Anyone who has done any signifigant research in to Edgar Cayce will find that the information he provides hold truth to it in some form. He offers even more information regarding earth changes if you feel inclined to explore his readings. For anyone who does not know who Edgar Cayce is, he is someone who has a enhanced psychic connection - through hypnotizing his self, he was able to enter a trance where his subconscious would be able to relay information from what is commonly described as the Akashic Records. The Akashic records are a form of energy that acts as a memory of events that occur. It can get really confusing, especially if you are uncovering this information from a limited perspective. All that is asked is to keep an open mind. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>To add to it, here is an interview that was just released this past week of a ET Contactee who seems to have been chosen to be an ambassador to spread word of the various Non-Terrestrial Biological Entities. The whole interview is worth a listen and is full of insightful information, but one part in particular captured my attention. <a href="http://youtu.be/UnAEx2BkTVg?t=1h39m">At this point in the video</a>, the individual discusses how a year ago he was shown a visual depicting events of a earthquake like disaster occurring in St. Louis. Give it a listen so that you can hear it from his perspective.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Now this information presented thus far is more of a depiction of events that have not occurred yet. Now people are welcome to subscribe to their own beliefs and may not have a clear understanding of how things tend to work. To put simply the events that take place in the future are possibilities when you are in the present. If an even is large enough then it has a higher chance of impacting multiple possible timelines. Any future event is subject to change based on the free will of all the various factors that lead up to it. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Looking back at the news stories, we already known from above the the USGS officially released an updated map this year regarding US hazardous activity. You can find that information [here}(<a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/)</a>).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I would like to add that earlier this summer a headline was making it\'s way around the internet of <a href="http://survivalbackpack.us/wal-mart-preparing-major-earthquake-new-madrid-fault/">Walmart performing drills in preperation for a major earthquake along the New Madrid fault line</a>. This seemed very interesting considering how timely it was with the USGS focusing on the high hazard around the area.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Now lets come back to Ferguson, it seems as though that this is an event that is not only escalating, but is being alloud to esculate for whatever reasons. Now there are people in control who are supporting the militirized police force, and are also sending in support against the protests and \'civil unrest\'. If you have been following the story through any mainstream news media, regardless if it is further down the channel of news to your local broadcast - you should not be surprised that the media coverage that is presented has been clearly approved to air. Censorship is quite common for television &amp; for anyone who was able to explore the events of Gaza &amp; Kiev, there is obviously fowl play to make the story appear in a biased or influencial manner. Unless someone is physically there during what is happening, it is hard to really have a trustful news source. ALl that we could discern is the facts that are available such as the people trying to protest the unlawful actions of a shooting, and the bulking of militirized police forces. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Given that events now occuring in Ferguson very well could be some sort of psyops or experiment by whichever powers seems to take control of the situation. Now this doesn\'t mean that the government is at fault here, but I would imagine that there are those who have the influence through various systems of power that could bend the outcome to a degree that would favor one\'s agenda. This should be something that is just as plausable in any case such as this. For anyone who has no sense of this existing, all you have to look at is the multiple attempts that western media has done by baiting Russia. Obviously it failed time &amp; time again, this allowing people to see what is truly going on.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>If it is at any case associated with the Industrial Military Complex, then we should consider the possiblity of the use of HAARP technolgoies to influence the frequencies in such an area. There are a ton of research out there that can link frequencies having an effect on ones psychological state. If, for example, the same type of low frequencies commonly used in HAARP can offer such a low vibration, it may allow those who can sense it to become effected. Now besides psycholgoical warfare, HAARP technologies have been linked to concentrate energy and have even seems to hold a heavy correlation to cause earthquakes. Nikola Tesla, the inventor who tried to release free energy and understood the nature of frequency technology - actually had experiences of using his technology in a certern range triggered an earthquake in his own workshop. For those who have done their homework, HAARP technologies came into existant by the military utilizing the same technologies that Tesla worked with. It has also been said that a lot of the work, notes &amp; writings by Tesla were confiscated after his death. It would be no surprise that such experiments would be constructed under a black budget. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>So with the events that are unfolding, and the information shared here. It seems to all link together and make sense. Whether the militarization is involed as a precursor for the earthquake, or if it is HAARP like technologies that are eventually going to cause such disturbances is yet unknown. But given the track record of those who seem to dominate the large power houses of the western world, I feel that it is just as plausable for people to see they are capable of such war-like crimes. After all, they are the same folks who have put the current Kiev government in place &amp; provide Israel with the necesitys to support Israel\'s war crimes in Gaza.</p>',

<blockquote>
<p>What did they gain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The event killed the nationwide reciprocity carry bill. Armed tourists would really hurt the police economy of Florida. without hundreds of muggings the crime rate would shrink and those Florida cops would lose substantial funding. Hell cops nationwide would lose revenue from arrests and release policy. Lower crime rate and arrests makes for a much lower budget and paycheck. Plus with dashcams becoming more common, its been harder for cops to make up a deficit by false traffic tickets. </p>
<p>Plus after these school shootings police departments get million dollar evergreen contracts with school districts. I\'m talking something like, 12 million dollars over 4 years, and the police can renew the contract with their own terms. The school districts can raise your property taxes too, and have to accommodate those independent school district police. A fleet of dodge challengers reinforced for head on collisions isn\'t cheap. </p>
<p>Ironically after that silver bullet cop car killed a county court clerk that bill about legally hitting protesters on roadways was killed too.</p>
<p>Essentially its like the old mafia racket. Pay up more protection money or we go after your kids and get the money. Even if you pay up, they still go after the kids for more money whenever they need it. </p>
<p>Whenever a law that isn\'t going to benefit police or Jewish institutions is going to pass, the Jewish institutions use their police to make a media spectacle to kill the law. Like Las Vegas and the suppressor bill. They hold police in place while a few paid actors, usually cops, get to go buckwild with some weaponry. Once its over, they dump a patsy and the cops blend in with the other responders. </p>
<p>Police are free masons. They worship king Solomon and the builders of the first Jewish temple.
so...parkland was a Muslim terrorist attack that authorities are covering up like they tried with the pulse nightclub massacre?</p>
<p>Not entirely unbelievable given the state of the ideological msm these days 
I followed this the religiously in the first month and collect all the little inconsistent stories the kids all tell. the biggest red flag for me was the girl was talked about going to the bathroom on the second floor (before the shooting) and seeing the gunman on the 2nd floor when he began shooting. this girl was the sister of someone who was in the AP psychology class. There was also a dead body at the intersection of the street</p>',

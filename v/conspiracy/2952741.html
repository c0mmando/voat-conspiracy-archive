            Every religion has its pedos. Catholic priests, Kike Child-Dick-Sucking Rabbis, Muhammed who raped a 9 year old and is considered the "perfect man."

            If Scientology had no pedos it would be the exception to the norm for religions.

            I'm an ex-Scientologist, was in for 20 years, many family and friends still in and ex. Never seen any evidence of child molestation or pedophilia at all, even in hindsight. There aren't that many Sea-Org members, and the vast majority do not have children, nowhere near enough kids in the Sea-Org to make them a global ringleader. Of the friends and family I personally know, I can't think of a single one of the several dozen who were in as kids who exhibit child rape psych markers, and none of them ever disappeared at any point in time. No feasible way to do anything with non-Sea-Org normal Scientologist's kids, they stay at home, just normal families. Scientology is also only active in western nations, pretty much, and don't do any international shipping or anything that can be used to hide international smuggling operations. They do have their cruise ship in Clearwater FL, but that ship only sails around the Gulf of Mexico with adults on it doing their OT crap.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure there's pedos among the Hollywood crowd, because Hollywood, but I don't think you'll find much evidence that Scientology has a pedo problem generally, and especially not that they're a global ringleader. But, if you find it, I'll be right there with you dragging them out to the gallows.

             no just little about scientology and my guess is that if they were involved it would not be in the trafficking end but in knowing about it and blackmailing those involved who chose to become members.  the mode of op of this group is uncovering info on its members then using the info to for blackmail purposes. so they might have low level members who are pedophiles nd ight even be involved in trafficking but my bet is that one are a part of the inner group controlling the cult but instead the cult threatens those involved with exposure if they don't pay up.

              I don't think many pedos or satanists would be attracted to being Scientologist, precisely because Scientology "auditing" basically digs up all your dirt (unless you are fairly talented liar, capable of fooling a lie detector). Anyone with something to hide like that would go through one auditing session and decide Scientology wasn't for them. They'd never go so far in that they'd actually divulged their evils, they'd simply opt out of continuing to be a Scientologist.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, Scientology does government intelligence agency level investigation into their enemies, and have engaged in blackmail to discourage legal attacks on them many times- so your hunch that they might know and be using the info could easily be correct.

               Classic scientology, The brainwashing hinges on you being convinced the e meter works, which it does not in any way, shape, or form, lie detectors have no scientific credibility at all.

                Lie detectors don't detect lies, they detect tiny changes in the electrical resistant of the body, which can be used to sort of tell if people are fidgety. They have no legal or scientific credibility because they are easy to fool, particularly if you have no moral qualms about lying (so, the people you wished it worked on, liars, are the hardest to catch), and give lots of false positives, because people can be fidgety even if they're telling the truth.
               </p>
               <p>
                E-meters are, however, portrayed in Scientology as unbeatable, sort of (you are informed that if you aren't honest, then auditing doesn't really work, which any thinking person will realize means that the E-meter and the auditor reading it can't definitively tell you're lying). But, I did a fair amount of hours of auditing behind the meter, and it definitely helps you read people a lot better than you could without it. The needle dances and ticks around pretty predictably from different emotional responses, and you can usually see them even if the person in front of the meter is silent and stone-faced.
               </p>
               <p>
                If a pedo walks in having no idea how to fool an e-meter (which admittedly I figured out after only a few sessions, though intentionally didn't do in order to not sabotage the process), then you think about how you diddled that kid and the auditor immediately says "What was that?" You answer with a lie, and they say "No, that's not it, what did you think about just before that thought?" And seemingly no matter how you lie, they can tell you aren't telling them about what you really thought about. Ultimately you have no idea how that needle moved, and no idea how to make some other thought replicate that needle movement of the evil thought, and you have no idea how the E-meter really works or what it's reading, and thus no idea how to manipulate it. In that situation, you'll cut your losses and walk right out the door of Scientology never to return. Doesn't matter that the E-meter isn't scientifically valid, doesn't matter that it can be fooled, doesn't matter that they didn't divulge anything damaging about themself, doesn't matter that Scientology is chock full of brainwashing, self-aggrandizing, propagandistic, cultish bullshit- I'm sure you can see why that pedo would never come back again.

              Why not like the theory behind the Free Masons? You have tons of past and present free masons who swear up and down it's a religious organization, and ton's who say it's controlled by satanists who keep the religious people on one side, and the satanists on the other side. Could be that the low level people only see the "good" in scientology while the evil side is reserved for the elite. Also the pedo angle would help explain why so many Hollywood people are into it.

               My parents were elite, and I have an aunt who is still in at the highest level, so I've known lots of the elites, and their children. The Sea-org is actually very egalitarian, the elites eat at the same cafeteria, sleep in the same dorms, have the same small apartments, and get basically the same pay as new members. They work crazy long hours, generally 60+ a week, not including their mandatory study time usually 25 hours a week. They get one day off, if they're "up-stat" (meaning upward trending performance statistics, thus they are doing their job well), and no days off if they're "down-stat". This is true for basically everyone in the religion except the highest level executives, though they are still very transparently present in all the same places and work a lot, too. Pretty much the only person who is significantly special is Miscavige, but he too works nonstop, and if you're in the Sea-org in Los Angeles, you probably see him around fairly often. If Sea-org elites are leading double lives, they've figured out how to not sleep, because that's the only way they could manage it.

               The Hollywood allure of Scientology is its worship of artists, and that Scientology courses and auditing legitimately can help you be a better actor (in my experience). But more importantly: Scientologists discriminate in favor of Scientologists, just like the jewish do in favor of jews, and such discrimination works very well.

               you could be right. my reasoning is least exposure legaly most gain. I am convinced what ever the story is that this group knows what is going on with pedophilia within government and Hollywood better then most of those involved.

            I listened to Leah Rimini's audiobook, which she read personally. She did indeed say that she was surprised when she first associating with Scientologists how much autonomy and freedom to make their own decisions the adults gave young people as young as ten years old. She was in her early to mid teens at the time and said she was treated as if she were an adult, and that this wasn't unusual.

            I have no difficulty believing the Scientologists are engaged in child trafficking. Your instincts are very good. Keep up the good work.

              Maybe make a post about it in

               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              . Mention your sub

               v/TSI
              </a>

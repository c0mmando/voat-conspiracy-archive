            I feel like going homeless sometimes as well. Their game should at least not be obvious to us. Makes the few of us with a brain just start seeing through it all.

             We don't have to be homeless, but we have to unplug on a massive scale. If we became self reliant, lived off the grid, didn't use oil, and gas, or put a penny in a bank. Basically quit being consumers. You would see their power quickly vanish, but then they would use brute force on us, and we would have to fight back.

              Yeah, but we here is not we on the scale it needs to be. I get that. I wish it would start happening like that. The word is just not out. No one can seem to defog from the mass hypnosis.... Internet is helping. I just hope they don't censor it completely before word gets out enough.

            I grew one strain out that was THC peaky and otherwise flat. It did have a nicer terp profile though. But the high was racy and fleeting.. zingy. Real lame and I'd never grow it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything with CBD in it also hits the body and is overall very relaxing. Anything with THC"v" in it is very uplifting physically and mentally and also controls the munchies and blood sugar. Just about all hybrids have a combination of those and produce a full body/head very well rounded effect that is pain reducing physically while also clear minded.
           </p>
           <p>
            They need to be grown properly with full spectrum lighting otherwise they're stunted in some way. The commercial shit that's being imposed on the market via the false legalization toxic shwag global carpeting industry is poison. Both grown completely stunted from the onset which prevents the full spectrum of expression in the first place, let alone to the extent it ought to be. They use a fraudulent clinic scheme to have false authority doctors prescribe their standardized baby safe 'low thc' and tap the tax trough with a pipe line.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're not generally 'improving' on evolution. We're harnessing it for the first time optimally, and have the fucking right to do so for a wide variety of reasons particularly including profit. One of the prime targets they're after while they feint with concern for saving the children, is the boomer market. Who they've got stacked on seven SSRIs at once in old age homes and just bilking the public at an extreme scale. Nobody says boo about em and our subvertive media pricks are are the heart of it lobbying the government for more with its own money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway I find with 'clean' weed that you grow yourself and a full profile it only leaves you feeling better. But exercise is also important.. and it makes it easier as well as more enjoyable. Also need the vitamins and B complex specifically to help avoid ever feeling like shit from it at all as sometimes if you're kind of worn out it can help drag you down energy wise and have an extended recovery period where people get lost in weeks or months of letheragy. B Complex is all you need and the THCv as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've grown in hydroponics using a few variations now from DWC wtih bubble buckets to this present biosystem and I've found flaws with them. So I've rethunk things and will be transferring to my method just as soon as I cut these plants out. The beauty is the simplicity, lowest start up cost and for highest performance achievable I predict.
           </p>
           <p>
            That helps unlock permaculture and I intend to although I may shut down for the hotter months as I'm still using CMH for now. Cree COB project pending.. most of the parts are all there. So I'm reducing heat generation, using passive means of cooling the root zone, etc. Its' a fucking beautiful system on an engineering level and should lack for nothing with an optimized root zone in the way that I think the plant actually wants it to be for a change. What my last system lacked. I could build off that too.
           </p>
           <p>
            But yeah all the strains that I just grew out are excellent. The GMO shit from Tweedsanto however.. should not exist.

            Have you grown your own? From my experience their new strains are just a parallel currency backed by speculation of those funding its competition's extinction. They store it in vaults to create the impression of value where there isn't any and it becomes a reserve for the speculators who trade off the people's broken backs while they further tap the public salt mines/tax pool and bleed it the fuck dry until hopefully they can deplete any usefulness of it whatsoever and we're pretty close to it already. Same with the immigration shit and they work well together.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm swapping over to a type of 'permaculture' now actually and far more advanced because it is as dead simple as physics would allow it to be using a pseudo active shallow water setup with thin film wicking and air pruning. I have even more plans but there's no economy of any sort for me regardless. I'll starve the beast when I take my last breath.
           </p>
           <p>
            Otherwise, you'd want a strain with some CBD and definitely THCv.. that's the winning combo. I'm satisfied with the array of cannabinoid profiles that I got this round. Terpene rich and well rounded, you can't go wrong.

            I cant really make out his outfit, kind of looks like he should be in the wizard of oz. He has excellent speaking qualities, engaging and captivating. I wouldn't be surprised is he is/was a real high flying individual who has seen too much shit and has gone off the grid, he might not be able to change things, but he doesnt have to play their game anymore.

            There are many layers of truth.  As you ascend you realize things that seem off.  This guy didn't wake up gracefully and he lost his ability to maintain his life.

            If any of you redpill, realize you're not alone and you need some good direction quick or you'll risk ending up like this.

              One stage is mental clarity.
             </p>
             <p>
              Zen Buddhism teaches how to stop all the mental fog from societal influences.  This will allow you to see reality.

              Sadhguru Jaggi is super woke.    Probably highest on earth I've witnessed.

            It's Vagabond. And I say this because in my mother tongue, this is essentially the same meaning, but it has very high-context negative connotation. I find it interesting that people use that term for themselves so quickly and willingly. There's so much more to that life that you talk about "before you had a family" and I, for one, can say I know exactly what you mean. The best word for me, though, was runaway wanderer.

             That's about it too, the Matrix summed it up, there are people out there that will fight tooth and nail to maintain their false reality they're that plugged in and addicted to... They vastly outnumber the awakened, that being the case if you know what's going on and happen to have convictions and integrity you will invariably be pushed out of the established system/Matrix...

            I really don't believe that shit that freemasons are harassing you. Old ass white guys bum rush you at work? Sorry I'm skeptical but I have family who was a practicing Freemason. I went to several events, met several of them. Classy, complete genetleman. Everyone says the freemasons are illuminati but I know them and at worst they are an old boys club, hardly the Soros types y'all wanna paint them out to be. I have been satisfied by my own personal experience that the freemasons are not illuminati, all the stuff I've seen to contradict it has been very questionable

            I would almost guess that this was staged.  On the other hand ive met really politically smart homeless people that choose to live the way they do because that is their revolt against the system.

             there's lots of highly inteligent people out there that don't have homes. they're either homeless or found a job that provides constant travel so they don't have to sit around and deal with "typical" life.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've spent most of my adult life traveling, the last two years I've been home nearly everyday and hate it. The only reason I do it is because I wanted kids and I'm getting to old for the work I was doing.

               a series of unfortunate events, I'm not even kidding.
              </p>
              <p>
               his routine could have been 3 cups of coffee every morning, then closing his front door 3 times before leaving. after that do something weird with the mailbox then off to work.
              </p>
              <p>
               but one morning something happens and he doesn't close the door 3 times before leaving, because he forgot to close the door as per tradition he forgot to mess with the mailbox.
              </p>
              <p>
               next thing he knows he's laying face down in the gutter all because he forgot to close the door 3 times.

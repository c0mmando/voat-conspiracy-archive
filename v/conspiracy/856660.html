            I wish I could get this country to supply me with some arms.. My arsenal is lacking. I am an honest working American and they give these radical maniacs high explosives like they are candy.

            The situation with TOW missilies is obvious to anyone who knows where TOW missiles come from, and that is the US mil/ind complex. What we see in the media is the "syrian rebels" aka, the FSA, retrieving air drops from the US, although, its funny (ironic) how these end up in the arms of ISIS almost immediately. Ever since Syria went into "civil war" the FSA has been backed and linked to ISIL for the most part, which is essentially an arm of ISIS/IS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now don't tell me, the US armed forces/intelligence are stupid enough to think they are only arming the FSA. They damn well know that the FSA is full of Islamic radicals alligned with ISIS. Why they continue to arm the FSA? Because it's a cover. A scapegoat -- "oh we were only trying to help the rebels". As we hear in the media... "the rebels". Whatever you call them, they are the same thing. Terrorists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the uprising in Syria, many who were fighting against Assad have turned away from the battle because of how the ISIS based groups have taken over, which is not what the  "revolutionaries" wanted... they didn't want sharia law. People had the intention of replacing Assad with a more favourable politician, but saw what was happening, that Syria itself was being destroyed by religious extremists being backed by the Americans and the Western world. Seeing what was happening, most of the original "uprising" fled the country, hence the migrant crisis in Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again it comes down to American interference, trying to topple a regime that has oil and assets. Destroy and rebuild. The profits of war come from rebuilding. In order to be able to rebuild something, you first have to destroy it.
           </p>
           <p>
            To put into contrast of previous years, you only have to look at the situation with the Muhajideen and the Soviets. When the soviet empire attacked Afghanistan, you can see (in documented history) that the Muhajideen were a guerrilla force, armed by the Americans, who in turn became more radicalized, splintering off into what we now call Al Qaeda under the rule of figures such as Osama Bin Laden. Yet we see 9/11 blamed on Osama, even though he was an asset previously.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is, war is profit. Without death and destruction followed by division in society (local and foreign) the military industrial complex will cease to exist. IT's just a gigantic game to these people. They take the side of who they favour most at destabilizing a region so that once it is destroyed, they can move in and rebuild.... most importantly, reshape -- society and government in that region, so that they can control and predict any outcome from a specific nations policies and problems.

            Americans still believe that ISIS is getting the best of the U.S. It's genuinely sad. I've tried swaying opinions but people couldn't imagine that our govt would do something that would be against our best interest.

            First off we support the moderate rebels in that region, the Taliban are to be trusted against the soviets, Al-quadea are working for us for to take this region, ISIS is to be trusted as they are the pannicle of America morales, ISIL can overcome their dictorship, Daesh are totally okay guys.

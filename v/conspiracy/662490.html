            I think it is quite the opposite. The agenda for thousands of years has always been methods of divide and rule. Get the people bawling over who's got darker skin, or who's got the best god, and the people become distracted from the important issues that slip by without a wink.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why people cannot see through the media rhetoric of "brown people are scary and evil" in recent years is beyond me.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look to the middle-east, it's almost about ethnic cleansing. The amount of lives that have been lost due to carpet bombing and bunker busting in recent years, is insane. You have Israel on the fore-front of the region, committing genocide on brown people whilst stretching their borders. You have the US bombing the shit out of several countries and propping up bases everywhere. The same goes for many Western (NATO) members. It seems to be nothing more than colonial expansion, except by proxy (hence the sock puppet dictators).
           </p>
           <p>
            Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, and now Syria are being decimated and the ruling authority pushed aside making place for a sock puppet dictator controlled by the West. How do you flush out the ruling authority? Easy. Train militants, fund them, and pretend you have nothing to do with it. Unleash the bogeyman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Order out of chaos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Manufacture a problem. Get the people on your side. Do something about it.
The classic "problem, reaction, solution" as coined by Icke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Along comes the media into the equation. "brown person has bomb", "brown person did this", "brown person did that" every single day. Day after day, you just keep repeating it. Drill it into peoples minds until they HATE those people. They will support bombing campaigns irregardless of who it kills. Are they all terrorists? No? as long as they have the media target pointed at them people will support unjust death of innocent people. This is what it comes to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout history you've had all kinds of groups being targeted... and they are not always brown skinned. From Jews, to Christians, the Soviets, to Blacks or even people who simply think a certain way. There is nothing new here in retrospect.
           </p>
           <p>
            To control the people, you first need to separate them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets say for one moment, everyone loved each other, and lived in peace. Nobody cared about skin colour, beliefs or views other than to listen and learn from others -- only to ask "why" they believe those things. How would you control everybody? You couldn't. The first step to controlling such a place like that, would be to drive a stake between the people, isolating them, condemning them, and telling them that they hate each other, until they actually do. Whilst the two groups are fighting each other, they don't notice the agenda you are laying down until it's too late for them to do anything about it.

            This is possibly the end goal of the EU at least (which is highly likely to be NWO in nature)
Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi of the  Paneuropean Union - had this to say:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The Eurasian-Negroid race of the future, similar in its appearance to the Ancient Egyptians, will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals."

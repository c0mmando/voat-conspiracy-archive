<p>This is something easily researched with freely available sources, but without any context for why any specific flights were targeted.

<p>The tempo of airliner attacks has increased and the authorities are certain these were missiles. Expensive, specialized tools aren\'t going to be used for random attacks.

            Or they get 4 out of 5 holders of a promising new patent on the plane and take it down, allowing control to shift to the Rothschild who funded the research and holds the remaining rights to the product.

            Shorting airline stocks right before taking out flights is a quick way to raise funds, especially with high frequency trading, where you can quickly switch positions seconds or minutes before, and can quickly get out of a position if your missile misses.

            Or they do it like the Polish? crash where they take it down in a pre-planned area, and have a cleaner team waiting nearby to execute any survivors and gather up any useful documents, computers, hard drives, etc.

            I'd say it's not a single rogue state actor, but a cabal of globalist deep staters embedded inside their own national and local governments and in media who use their positions to control the narrative.

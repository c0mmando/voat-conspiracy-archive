            Fra’ Giacomo dalla Torre, who has died aged 75, was the 80th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta; he was elected to the office by the Order on May 2 2018.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Knights Hospitallers, as the Order was originally known, was founded in the Holy Land by the Blessed Gerard in the year 1113 with the mission of protecting pilgrims and maintaining a hospital for their benefit. Over the years, the Order developed its military wing, though its members still took religious vows, and fought the infidel in the Holy Land.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later the Order held Rhodes and then Malta as outposts against the Turks, losing the latter island to Napoleon in 1798. In the 20th century the Order returned to its roots, caring for the poor and the sick, and running a worldwide charitable operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            While most Knights are laymen, some still take religious vows, and the late Grand Master was one of these fully professed knights. While most members are no longer from noble families, the upper echelons of the order are still reserved to those with the correct number of quarterings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Count Giacomo dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto was born on December 9 1944 in Rome, of a noble but by no means ancient family originally from Treviso and long associated with the Vatican. His father, Paolo dalla Torre, was an art historian and director of the Vatican Museums from 1961 to 1975. His grandfather, Giuseppe Dalla Torre, was editor of the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano from 1920 to 1960. His brother, also Giuseppe, had been head of the Vatican judiciary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dalla Torre studied Christian Archaeology and Art History at the Sapienza University of Rome. For some years he taught classical Greek at the Urbaniana, one of Rome’s pontifical (that is, Papal) universities, where he became chief librarian and archivist. He published several monographs on the history of medieval art.
           </p>
           <p>
            He joined the Knights of Malta in 1985 and took religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience as a Knight of Justice in 1993. As one of a very small group of full members of the Order, he was rapidly promoted through the various offices that were reserved for knights who had taken vows.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2004, dalla Torre was elected Grand Commander of the Order. As such, he automatically became acting head of the Order upon the death of the 78th Grand Master, Fra’ Andrew Bertie, on February 7 2008. As the leading Italian member of the Order, dalla Torre was considered a candidate for the magistracy, but another Englishman, Fra’ Matthew Festing, was elected on March 11 the same year with a large majority.
           </p>
           <p>
            The seven-year tenure of Grand Master Festing exposed tensions in the order. With huge resources and a worldwide reach, maintaining embassies in several countries, the order could compete with several other international charitable organisations.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, some, Festing included, feared a secularising drift in the order’s activities at the expense of its Catholic spirit. This was exemplified by a row over condom distribution by one of the order’s agencies in the developing world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further rifts opened up with the proposal made by prominent Germans to change the order’s structure and allow unprofessed knights to take the top jobs, while at the same time not abolishing the requirement for noble blood; this would break the monopoly on power enjoyed by the knights with vows and still keep out what they saw as the influence-hungry and dollar-rich Americans, none of whom were of noble birth. (It was significant that there was not a single German professed knight.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Added to this was the power struggle in the Vatican between conservatives and modernisers, who took a great interest in the Order and its considerable financial resources; the latter party, led by the Pope himself, reputedly viewed it as elitist and out of touch. When Festing tried to sack the chief moderniser for insubordination, an appeal was made to the Pope, who stepped in and effectively removed Festing from office.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2017, three months after the coup that removed Festing, dalla Torre was elected acting head of the Order. The next year, as one of the few eligible candidates among those who had taken vows, he was elected Grand Master.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dalla Torre was regarded by many as a deeply pious and exemplary Knight of Malta, who was devoted to helping the poor and the sick. He was notable for his personal involvement in feeding the destitute of Rome at Termini Station, and on his foreign visits during his short reign he was assiduous in visiting the patients in the various clinics run by the order.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nevertheless, he was seen by others as a simple character who was utterly in the hands of the German faction, and quite ineffective in dealing with some of the more dominant members of the order, with their plans for changing the organisation. At the time of his death the constitutional question had still not been resolved.
           </p>
           <p>

            Manufacturing Consent is what Noam Chomsky has called it since his day's at MIT DARPA - You guys realize that your MARK-OV bots that dice and slice language here spit out shit from these bots that it all came from Chomsky's work on computational linguistics?

            Hippie culture is now viewed as synonymous with the anti-war movement, but as the book points out, that wasn’t always the case. A thriving anti-war movement existed before the first hippie emerged on the scene, along with a women’s rights movement, a black empowerment/Black Panther movement, and various other movements aimed at bringing about major changes in society. All of that was eclipsed by and subsumed by the hippies and flower children, who put a face on those movements that was offensive to mainstream America and easy to demonize. And as you mentioned, a second purpose was served as well – indoctrinating the young and impressionable into a belief system that serves the agenda of the powers that be.

            All the dark forces of McCarthyism, and Rand Corporation were all part of the Flower Sexual Revolution - Funny thing is what they did in 1920's Germany, why did it take only 15-20 years to manifest Nazism in Germany, but its taken them almost 50 years to turn USA into Nazi Germany?

            virtually everything I have discovered – including the military/intelligence family backgrounds of so many of those on the scene, both among the musicians and among their actor counterparts; the existence of a covert military facility right in the heart of the canyon; the prior connections among many of the most prominent stars; the fact that some of the guiding lights behind both the Rand Corporation and the Project for a New American Century were hanging out there at the time, as were the future governor and lieutenant governor of California, and, by some reports, J. Edgar Hoover and various other unnamed politicos and law enforcement personnel; and the uncanny number of violent deaths connected to the scene – all tend to indicate that the 1960s counterculture was an intelligence operation.

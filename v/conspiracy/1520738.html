<p>From <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Stratfor#Personnel_and_relevant_emails_by_hierarchy">http://pizzagate.wiki/Stratfor#Personnel_and_relevant_emails_by_hierarchy</a> :</p>
<p>George Friedman, founder and CEO</p>
<p>Fred Burton is Vice President for Intelligence, and sent most of the information on &quot;OBL&quot;</p>
<p>I made a timeframe of Fred Burton\'s communications for those who seem unsure of his confidence in the situation:</p>
<p>2011-05-02 05:26:15 Fred Burton: &quot;Reportedly, we took the body with us. Thank goodness.&quot;</p>
<p>2011-05-02 05:33:15 Fred Burton: &quot;We told the Pakis after we killed him. But, will praise GOP publicly. All spin and bullshit.&quot;</p>
<p>2011-05-02 05:47:25 Fred Burton: &quot;Raymond Davis operation was related to the case. CIA unilateral source in Paki worked without the Pakis knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>2011-05-02 05:51:12 Fred Burton: &quot;Than onward to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Bethesda.&quot;</p>
<p>2011-05-02 13:36:41 Fred Burton: &quot;Body is Dover bound, should be here by now. &quot;</p>
<p>I should mention that Osama bin Laden was &quot;officially&quot; killed around 0100 PKT on May 2, which would have been 1400 on May 1 in Austin (where Stratfor is based). These timestamps suggest this chain of emails uses PKT (Pakistan Standard Time) or some nearby timezone, possibly hinting at where Stratfor was operating that day as the emails were sent from BlackBerry phones.</p>

            fair enough.  Sorry for losing my temper.

           <p>
            That's not how it works.  Al Queda's organization is decentralized by design.  There is no central leadership.  Bin Laden was a figurehead.  People rallied around him and used him as a symbol.  Terrorist organizations don't use central leadership because they know that there is going to be high turnover in the leadership.  By using self sufficient cells that rarely communicate with other cells it protects the greater organization from things like leaders being captured and tortured.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Because MK Ultra was canned  after we figured out it didn't work.  LSD doesn't prime people for mind control.  If they were going to try mind control Dragon's Breath would be a better candidate.

            If I seem overconfident in my views it's probably for two reasons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              We never went to war with Pakistan after invading them with a military force, killing a bunch of people and blowing a bunch of shit up. Google abbottabad compound pictures, find a source you like and look around.  Under international law we declared war on Pakistan with a surprise attack and absolutely nothing came from it.  I was there when it happened.  Not as much as a peep came out of Pakistan after we illegally invaded them, not even asking for restitution from the US in international court.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This is a conspiracy subverse (which doesn't help your case believe it or not) and your source of information are a bunch of people who very publicly show that they are incapable of dealing with confirmation bias.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Of course I can be wrong.  Of course you can be right.  This may even be the case now, but the evidence is against you (the royal you), and if the only thing that you can do is say that I'm being mind controlled by the government using a program that has been shown not to work then that starts to strain credulity.  If mind control worked then companies would be using it to make money.

            In the first paragraph you said that I said two things that I didn't.  If you're going to be replying to things that I didn't say then I'm not going to bother reading what you have to say.  Quit strawmanning and I'll have the conversation.  Otherwise I'm not going to waste my time on you, regardless of how hypocritical you feel that is.

            I just briefly read through the emails and I don't see 'evidence' of conspiracy.  All I see is that these guys admit to not knowing the truth about the incident.

            He wasn't on the same ship.  He has no more insight into this event than any of us.  He's trying to use his military experience as some kind of evidence that his hunches are correct.

             The CIC of the ship I was on is the tactical center for the strike fleet.  The Enterprise was the flagship of the carrier fleet, not to mention the flagship of the strike group.  That means that the complete tactical situation for the fifth fleet was known in the CIC.  I was two seats to the right of the TAO, working on the ships defense systems.  That means that I had a very good seat for the show.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I did see:
            </p>
            <p>
             There was a military flight out of Pakistan that wasn't authorized by Pakistan.  Under international law, this alone is an act of war.  This flight rendezvoused with the Carl Vinson.
            </p>
            <p>
             As soon as this flight was over, the call went out that we got Bin Laden.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's what I know not from the CIC:
            </p>
            <p>
             The party line, that Bin Laden was assassinated in Abbottabad Pakistan in a raid that was illegal and an act of war under international law.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pakistan didn't declare war, or even ask for reparations for our blatant act of war against them.
            </p>
            <p>
             We had enough dirt on Pakistan that we were able to declare war on them, go into their country, crash a top secret helecopter, then blow it up using high explosives, shoot up a house and kill a bunch of people, then leave the country and accuse them of harboring terrorists that attacked the US and get away with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing that I can imagine would allow us to get away with this (not just with Pakistan, but with the Hague) is the capture of Bin Laden in Abbottabad actually occurring.

                My point is that you are claiming to know something that you cannot prove.  You assume that because of your position in the command center of some ship, that nobody could carry out a clandestine operation without your knowledge.

                 Your point is wrong then.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What I said is that due to my vantage point during the operation the chain of events proposed in this thread is definitely what happened.  Beyond that all I am saying is that the official story is much more likely than CIA agents mind controlling a carrier strike fleet in the Indian Ocean where it is within strike range of 3 or 4 countries that we're not allied with.  It's also more likely than the US invading another country with an armed military force, killing civilians and then flying out and having nothing bad come from it in the UN.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Occam's Razor man.  There is too much going on here that can be explained by simpler explanations.  I disagree with

                 on this, but his explanation is at least plausible.  You need to think this through some more, and pay more attention to the details.  I'm not necessarily saying that I'm correct, I'm just saying that you definitely aren't.

                  Ok.  How about this for Occam's Razor?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OBL was a bogeyman/scapegoat ever since 9/11.  He was widely reported to have been on dialysis in the early 2000s.  Mossad agent, Rita Katz and her SITE intelligence group released fake videos using a different actor playing OBL to keep the narrative going.  It was reported several times over the years that he was killed in action.  No actual video of him had been seen for many years prior to the Abbottabad raid.  The white house released a photo of Obama and his staff in the 'situation room' allegedly watching the raid.  The photo was proven fake when Leon Panetta said that there was no live feed during the raid.  No footage of the alleged raid was ever released that could positively identify Bin Laden.  The original official story was admittedly full of lies, and was officially revised weeks later.  No body was ever produced and no photos of the body were ever released.  In other similar cases, we were shown the body, Hussein and Gaddafi for example.  Conclusion: FAKE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I don't know where you got the scenario that 'CIA agents mind controlled a carrier strike fleet'.  If it was between that nonsensical straw man and the official story, I could see why you would believe the latter.

                    Thanks for pointing that out.  I hadn't seen any of those images before.  In the future, I will definitely say the photos are fake, rather than say they weren't released.  But that minor detail doesn't really change my argument much.

                    By the way, is there one particular photo that you think is the real one?  Because I see photos showing different wounds, apparent ages, and clothing.

            I read the first two sentences and realize that you haven't been paying attention to what I'm saying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone can be deceived.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point that I actually made is that I was there and no one, not one person, not even a rumor of any impropriety going on.  The point that I'm making is that three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead.  The op that killed Bin Laden took a lot of people.  No one suggested that the operation was a false flag for a couple of years after it happened.  I'm saying that I was in the neighborhood, and that if it were faked it would have taken thousands of man hours to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's kinda how those idiots who believe the moon landing was faked just ignore things like the tech pubs for the Saturn V or LEM that would have been easier to actually build than fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually reply to what I said and I'll read the rest of your comment.  If you're not going to pay attention then neither am I.

            You guys believe whatever you want. I'm really not working on the f***ing old news.
           </p>
           <p>
            But really, the emails confirm what everyone I know, already knew.

            If you don't get it, I can not help you with that. Everyone finds out someday, I suppose.. Or then, sometimes they don't,

           <p>
            But in any case, I found the citation : Obama stonewalls SEAL Team 6 helicopter crash probe, watchdog says
           </p>
           <p>
            SEAL team 6 was said to be the team which "carried it out."

           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently members of the team were killed, less than one year after the "event," in a crash.
And then another helicopter crash killed the suppsed leader .. -

            Obama and them must be hobbled , having the brainwashed/ i.e. people who are being lied to, carrying out their orders? No wonder things go wrong

            I remember this from 5 years ago and so I can't prove they changed the story .. But I remember that the news did change. It's first came out that they were all killed. Then it was air-brushed, for obvious reasons.

             As far as I'm aware it is a myth that the squadron that killed 'OBL' or his look-a-likey was wiped out in a later CH47 helicopter shoot down. Seal Team 6 is organized into assault and support squadrons that are color coded. Neptune Spear (the 'OBL' assault) was executed by Red Squadron. The 22 operators who were killed in the CH47 incident were apparently assigned to Gold Squadron.

              That was claimed after the fact . Add that to a slew of lies by the State News / State. Life is too short to list them all.

              Everyone knows, in any case, that there was no "Obama" there.. So who really "killed him" or "captured him" is really a moot point. 
From "Veteran's Today" Auguest 6th 2011

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Today 31 NATO troops, 20 of them Navy Seals from the Osama bin Laden operation died in what is reported as a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.
              </p>
              <p>
               The chances of this story being true is almost nil.  The chances of this being a staged coverup is over 80%.  We believe these people were murdered to silence them.  This is why.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have solid information on two areas:
              </p>
              <p>
               Osama bin Laden died in 2001 as an active CIA employee and his body was recovered in Afghanistan and taken to “the sand box.”  We were told it was frozen.  We have so much verification from this, CIA, ISI, US military and top officials.  I have a direct confirmation from Bin Laden’s CIA handler who I grilled mercilessly on this.
The Abbottabad operation involved numerous American deaths, witnessed, bodies all over, a helicopter crash. (suppressed translated TV interview below)  These bodies were recovered by land vehicle from Islamabad and there was NO “successful” bin Laden operation of any kind.  There was and has been a CIA safe house in Abbotabad where terror suspects were stored for years.

              <p>
               Let’s talk about the Abbottabad farce.  We have a long dead and horrifically sick man, often treated in American hospitals, supposedly watching a small TV where he had been in a “safe house.”
              </p>
              <p>
               You pick the story, he leaps up, grabs an AK, pulls a defenseless woman in front of him as a human shield, and dies in a hail of gunfire, just like Bonnie and Clyde.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, we see scraps of a stealth helicopter all over and get reports of 6 American dead, in fact more Americans than the one helicopter could hold.
              </p>
              <p>
               The original plan was to set up a forward operating base in Pakistan, drive up supplies and fuel.  They flew in the short range stealth helicopter, landing it in Pakistan. When it hit a stone fence and caught fire, killing the crew and most occupants, they abandoned that plan.  The real plan was to capture bin Laden, fly him to the refueling base and then off to Bagram Air Force Base.
              </p>
              <p>
               As to who or what they planned for “show and tell” as bin Laden, we can only guess.  The Israeli’s had been dealing with phony bin Laden’s for years.  With no bin Laden, a cover story had to be invented, the magic flight across a continent in a “stealth” flying “garbage truck,” the CH53 Sea Stallion.
              </p>
              <p>
               It gets better, the flight to a carrier in the Indian ocean.  You see, the stealth helicopter was gone.  There was no way to get from there to the Indian Ocean.  The story gets better.  Try to find out about Pakistan’s air defense systems.  Go ahead.  Pakistan supposedly wasn’t able to detect the stealth helicopter that flew in from Afghanistan.  However, the multiple CH53’s that would  have had to make the 1300 kilometer flight would have had a problem or two.

              How does this relate to "Pizzagate" / The extent of the Propaganda is formidable. Anyone who studies Pizzagate need to understand the authorities lie.

             <p>
              You don't find that out until they lie about you and yours. 
There are people who keep tabs regardless.

               My friend, in general I believe all what you quote/say, although I will always have my doubts about certain specific details.  In this world of false narrative and disinformation I do not ever feel we understand what truly happens 100% of the time.
              </p>
              <p>
               All secondhand information is basically hearsay.  However, there are times when we must generally accept the expert opinion (physics, chemistry, surgery, geology, etc.), but in others we must always question more (politics, economics, psychology, climate, etc.).

                The subject of 'proof" and 100% certainty is a philosophical and epistomological subject and discussion.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's important to understand the tools used to separate truth from fiction. It's a science of knowlege, which is lost.
               </p>
               <p>
                This knowledge is used by the designers of our present system to fool the average person. (the tools are inverted and used to disguise the truth rather than reveal it)
               </p>
               <p>
                Most people are never taught the ancient subject field of separating truth from fiction.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are taught instead to rely upon "experts" which is just one fatal error, but a central one.
               </p>
               <p>
                In fact they are taught that truth / reality doesn't exist.. ie. "There is no truth but what you think"
"Everyone has their own truth; they create their own truth"
"Nothing is real" "False memories" And on from there.
               </p>
               <p>
                All that New Age and "modern" philosophy is promoted for a very specific reason; to dominate those who are fooled.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a lot of work to get up to speed on this subject. I will try to add more citations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Start with the "History of FM Radio" and Mind Control and Psychobiology of Music.

                "Expert" opinion is bullshit.. Think for yourself. 
Most "experts' mind are conditioned; and so is the public, deliberately.

                There are scores of hours of research, backed up by citations and documentation, showing the efforts put into social engineering / cultural engineering.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is called persuasion and mind control. How is that done? Through 'experts"
               </p>
               <p>
                If people believed the "experts" they would say "Pizzagate" is fake news" since that's what the experts say.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Experts" by reputaton are not valid sources; people must go to the primary material themselves. 
To understand what is going on it is necessary to think "outside the box"
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a "fence" of perception, put all around us to keep us under control i.e. Propaganda; the notion that only the "experts" know for sure. And that we need to go along with what they tell us, keeps us fenced in a trap.
               </p>
               <p>
                Those who intend to mis-lead are desperate to have us depend upon their "experts" . from "Snopes" on down [or up, as the case may be]

                 This is what I finally understood: all famous people are there to misdirect you. ALL OF THEM. They
didn't accidentally get famous. They don't accidentally get on TV or in movies or in books or on CDs
or on the internet. And they certainly don't earn their way into these positions, as is now clear. So how
did they get there? Why do you have to see them and hear them all the time? Why do you know who
they are? Because they were placed there. They were chosen to fill that position, and they were chosen
in order to misdirect you from the truth.
You will say, “C'mon, Miles, that can't be true. All of them? I mean, they disagree with eachother.
How can they all be placed there?”
Look at it this way: say you wanted to control everyone in the world. Well, people are at different
levels. They have different interests and beliefs and levels of intelligence. So if you want to control
everyone, you have to place your guys at all these levels, on all possible paths.
If you are a football coach setting up a defense on the field, you don't put all your tacklers in the middle
of the field, or all on one side. You spread them out. You want to block all possible paths to the goal.
You have to defend against the run and the pass, the short ball and the long ball.

             I remember all of this too.  Also, I remember all the videos taken at the scene in Abbottabad where the neighbors all say that they knew the inhabitants of that building and there was no way OBL was ever inside.

             And don't forget the stealth helicopter that crashed on the scene during the raid.  There were photos of that at the time as well.

            If there is no news on the SEAL helicopter crash, it was scrubbed. Deleted.. But maybe the info will surface. My resources are limited since my site was defaced on the 10th.. Lots of people remember the Helicopter crash news.

             Just curious, what is CIC and how can you be sure it was him? It was my understanding that bin laden died in early 2000's from kidney failure. Is that incorrect?

              That is incorrect.  Bin Laden died in a raid performed by Navy Seals on a compound on the outskirts of Abbottabad Pakistan in 2011.

              The CIC is the combat information center.  It's the tactical command for the ship, and in the case of aircraft carriers, it's the central tactical hub for the strike group.  When you see it in movies it's the blue lit room that has all the radar screens and the glass panels that people write on with wax pencils.

               Didnt he get killed hiding in a hole in Pakistan? Thats going to be the holy site to rally the troops, the body could have at least had forensics done on it before they disposed of it.

                He was hiding in a compound on the outskirts of Abbottabad.  It was within 10 blocks of one of Pakistan's largest military bases and we illegally invaded Pakistan to carry out the raid.  The only reason this didn't cause serious diplomatic problems for us is that we caught Pakistan (a country that was claiming to support us) hiding the person they were supposed to be helping us find.
               </p>
               <p>
                It wasn't a hole.  It was a safehouse.  If they want to make a holy site out of it, they're going to have to do so in a country that doesn't publicly support them (kinda like the US ironically) 10 blocks away from one of the largest military presences in that country.

             No offense, but you witnessed a burial at sea. Not necessarily of Osama bin Laden unless you're willing to commit to that statement.

             It goes without saying that George Friedman and Fred Burton have way higher pay-grades and clearances than we will ever have.

                The guy is saying he was on the ship that Osama was jettisoned from.  And that word would "get around the ship" if it wasnt Osama that was dropped.  My point is how would anyone know.  The seals would have brought Osama out in a bag.  It would have been taken to the morgue or whatever.  Unless they had a "wake" or open casket viewing less than 10 people would have seen the body, before the casket was tossed overboard.  The notion that it had to be Osama's body because you cant keep a secret on a ship is stupid.

              No offense, but you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  The military is not the civilian world.  We look out for each other, and an operation that involves that many people being faked would get around the ship.  At the very least it would be a rumor, and that's being incredibly fucking generous.

               Hey man. That carrier thingy is fucking huge okay. I did get a tour on one once and holy shit its fucking massive.  It would be a LOT easier to fake some shit like that on a carrier than youre willing to admit.  Did you or did you not see his body?  Were you a part of the packaging so to say?  Were you just a stand in?  Were you told to fucking be there?  Faked or not, it would be easy to fucking do on a carrier.  Open your mind and go research who the real bin laden is then tell me what you think.  Btw he died in 01.

                That carrier thingy is called a ship.  Once you've spent the better part of a year on one come back and tell me how big it is.
               </p>
               <p>
                Like I said in my previous post I was in the CIC.  When you watch a movie that involves Navy ships the CIC is the room with all the radars screens and blue lights.  It's the brain center for the ship.
               </p>
               <p>
                My point is that you don't understand the mindset of military people (obviously) or how fast scuttlebutt travels across a ship (again, obviously).
               </p>
               <p>
                I get that no matter what I say you aren't going to change your mind about it.  You've already decided that Osama bin Laden is still alive, along with Elvis and Robo-Hitler.  Nothing I'm going to say is going to change that.  I get that.  I'm just calling bullshit.

                 Actually i was saying hes been dead for a long time.  Since like 2001.  Also i like your scuttlebutt. I can tell you that the Abraham Lincoln has a crew of 3000+ when the aircrew is not aboard,  i can tell you that we were not in the south pacific during the filming of the movie stealth, (involving the navy)  and i can also tell you that dragging bodies out of the indian ocean after the tsunami of dec, 24th 2004 really fucking sucked.  :)  we dont look out for each other nearly as much as you say,  i understand perfectly.  I dont need to go blabbing about all my expertise in some field of study to make my point.  Sure the cic, good for you.  Did you see his body?  Were you or were you not a part of the burrial?  Regardless of wether or not you were there, all you probably were was just a pissant po3 or less.  What proof do you have that it was a legitamate burrial of said person?  None.

                  I'm not saying that people have each other's back.  I'm saying that when you have 5000+ people stuck on a ship with each other for 9 months, it's impossible to keep secrets.  There wasn't even a rumor that that's not what went down.

                  I was PO2 so not exactly a pissant, all of which is ignoring the fact that rank has little to do with quality of work.

                 <p>
                  No, I wasn't part of the burial detail.  I wasn't even on the ship where he was buried.  Where I was was in the room where all the radio traffic and tactical information was being fed, sitting two seats to the right of the TAO.

                    I did mine as a well connected petty officer.  There would have been at least a rumor if something were going on.  The more people in on a secret, the less likely it will be kept.  This is particularly true with something that stands antithetical to all the honor, courage, commitment bullshit that they never stop beating into people.  Someone would have been disgruntled enough to complain, and that's the kind of rumor that would spread like fire through the strike group.

                   <p>
                    Given that no one was saying the Bin Laden assassination was faked until years later and no one there is corroborating you, you guys are full of shit.

                     Exactly!  So maybe the only people who knew it wasn't Bin Laden was a Navy Admiral (maybe), CIA higher ups and the POTUS and his cronies?

                      The Chaps would have to know about it.  The seal team that performed the raid would have to know about it (after all, if you were involved in a raid that didn't happen you would know about it as soon as it started showing up on the news).  We were definitely performing operations in the area that day, and we did fly people out of a military operation in a country that we weren't at war with, and didn't have permission to be in (which in any situation besides the one that occurred, would be a declaration of war).  The only way that war wouldn't be declared is if we caught Pakistan performing an action that would have been a declaration of war... Something like harboring a terrorist who killed thousands of Americans.

                      You guys are wrong on this one.  You've been right a lot lately, but that's more by accident than anything.  The simplest explanation is usually the correct one.  The more people in on a secret, the less likely it's to be kept ,as is the case with Snowden.  Eventually someone comes forward, regardless of the risks... particularly with Americans, and even more so with the military.

                     I was saying it was fake the very moment I heard about it and saw the staged 'situation room' photo.  Ever since the Rita Katz videos with a different actor playing the role of OBL, it was obvious that he was just an Emanuel Goldstein.

                        The US performed a violent military action on a nuclear power.  Under international law this is an invasion.  Invasions are an act of war.  The United States of America invaded a nuclear power.  I don't know how many ways I can say this and get it through.  If Russia flew a helicopter into queens, broke into someone's house and killed him and his family what do you think would happen?

                            I'm saying that I believe most of the official story.  I'm saying that most of the shit that I've seen in conspiracy theorist circles is people ignores anything that doesn't agree with their pet hypothesis and then running full steam into confirmation bias.

                              Well, it helps if you ask.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I think that Osama Bin Laden organized an attack on the WTC and the Pentagon.  I think that GWB and his inner circle knew about the attack, and allowed it to happen (similar to what happened with Pearl Harbor).  I don't think that Bush and Co thought that the two towers would collapse, I think that they allowed it to happen because it got them into a war in the area, and that's kinda been our schtick since at least Bush Sr.  I don't think explosives were planted in the buildings.
                             </p>

                              Steel doesn't melt at the temp that jet fuels burns at atmospheric pressure.  It does become more plastic though.  The steel undergoes plastic deformation until it reaches it's point for it's specific pressure/temp.  Once the steel fails, it no longer provides the support for the building, the walls collapse, and the floors start pancaking.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              There was plenty of motivation for Bush and Co. to do a false flag attack.  There were people willing to attack us.  It's easier for Bush and Co. to let one through, and there far less risk of getting caught doing this.  It's harder to prevent all the possible attacks, then make your own force to attack, and successfully carry out the attack without getting caught/getting the whistle blown on you.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Hope that helps.

            The quote from Stratfor is "it's a crime scene". A user on Reddit pointed out it may be that it wasn't the right guy but got published as such to promote Barack Obama during a time of poor public opinion. In any case it's spooky as fuck.

             How could it be the "right guy?" The real guy had bad kidney disease and died years before. It was Propaganda.. no shit. How was he [allegedly] out there for so long and not caught anyway. It's a cartoon. They also claimed he used his wife as a shield ... I'm sure. That's out of a cartoon. Bad script writers.

              Right.  They purposely gave us a total bullshit story at first.  Then, little by little, they revised it to something that, when compared to the original story, sounded more believable.

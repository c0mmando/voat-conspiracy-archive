<p>We are exposed to lots of xenoestrogens in the environment, such as from plastics (which are conveniently everywhere thanks to big oil) containing PCBs and BPA which disrupt our natural hormone chemistry. This is also due to GMO soy or soy in general that has the effect of mimicking estrogen (which is also conveniently everywhere in many processed or pre-packaged foods, thanks to Monsanto). Why do you think that a lot of males we see (including ourselves) look &quot;hipster&quot; or effeminate compared to our ancestors or grandfathers? Why are more straight males less interested in sex or have sexual problems? Why are there more gays than ever before, more than the typical deviant percentage? Why do we now we have more people like &quot;Caitlyn&quot; Jenner becoming transgender? A lot hormone-altering chemicals are being exposed to us prior, during and after birth that affect our physical and mental development as a human being. In the past few decades we have seen a surge of &quot;confused&quot; people and I strongly believe that this is the reason why. This is possibly part of the population control agenda by the elite globalists. Through the MSM, they would have the general population believe that being gay or transgender is &quot;normal&quot;. I have nothing against such people, but I find it odd that there seems to be a surge of &quot;deviants&quot; in the past few decades. When we are so confused and distracted, amongst a host of other things in life that have been engineered by design, we can\'t organize an effective resistance let alone live healthy lives. What is to be the outcome of our futures, and the future of our unborn children (if we can still even have children due to these xenoestrogens, let alone be able to afford kids these days)?</p>

            It's an agenda that is being pushed on us, and it's all about the money. Around the 60's the marxists realised that they could never break through into politics because people just didn't want it, there solution was cultural marxism, to do it culturally rather than politically. The idea was to infiltrate media, music, film, church, and the education system so they could slowly bring in their ideals and promote them, one of their goals was to break down the traditional family. And they've been doing a good job of all of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets face it if you have a traditional family of 4-5 people with one mortgage, and you can manage to seperate them, you could be looking at 3-4 mortgages from them instead of the one. Not to mention household appliances, rather than share a washing machine they buy one each, they will be buying 3-4x everything that they would have if they was all living together. That could potentially triple profits on products compared to if they was to remain as a family unit, mortgages, microwaves, computers, and whatever a home needs.
           </p>
           <p>
            How do you go about breaking up a traditional family? well they've been doing so by promoting the gay and transgender agendas, as well as pushing hardcore feminism. They want to turn couples against each other and create a divide and hopefully split families to get the goals they want. It's on record that a few billionaires have been funding some feminist groups, and I don't mean the ones looking for equality, I mean the hardcore feminists that say they wouldn't sleep with a man even if they wanted a child, the feminists that want to see men taxed for white privelege. There is a lot of money going into these groups to make men hate women and women hate men and drive a wedge between the two. What is a shame is that there seems to be a lot of young girls who don't know better getting caught up in it all as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rap seems to be pushing the gay agenda a lot these days, I've seen an interview with Suge Knight where he says that 95% of rappers today are gay, and there are many other rappers who back him up on with that too. A few have been seen kissing others, some calling another baby or daddy, and there has also been a lot of rappers doing gigs in what would appear to be skirts of sorts or dressing in a camp or effeminate manner. It would seem that if you want to get a record deal in rap these days, you have to be either gay, effeminate, or androgynous. The same seems to be true for TV to at this time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The recent spate of media frenzy around Caitlyn Jennar is just a part of that too I suspect. I'm not saying he did he for these reasons, obviously he did what was right for him, I just mean that the media have really got behind this and pushed it. No coincidence about Conchita Worst winning the eurovision song contest either I suspect. There's also Jaden smith saying he's going to start wearing skirts, and there are articles about Angelina Jolie raising gender confused children and both being dressed up as the opposite sex. also note the amount of guys crossdressing in movies these days too.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not homophobic or against transgender, I have gay friends and family myself and I've always been a believer in doing what is right for your own well being as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. But the fact is, considering the general amount of gay people in most populations is said to be around 1.5 to 1.8%, we seem to be having a disproportionate amount of LGBT issues in the news and media that would lead anyone to think that the gay population is 30-40%. I've been following and researching these issues for quite some time now now and it's a trend that only seems to be getting stronger and stronger. And celebrities as usual are at the forefront of setting these trends, it would seem if you want a record contract, or to be in a film, or a job in media, then you must promote some of these issues in order to to get that job, those that can't agree to do so are held back and their careers suffer.

             We shouldn't be against people of mixed sexualities because we are all human, but we should maintain a strong normal heterosexual foundation for the continued survival of the human race. We shouldn't have to state this because it's supposed to be normal and expected, it would be like saying the sky is blue because it's common sense and factual.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not aware of what is going on in terms of the rap culture because I typically steer clear from many mainstream media sources including music. I have read on another blog about the issue of feminism and how it was designed by the elites to divide men and women. There are many separate problems that we face in the modern age and the more we read about them, the more we should realize that these are all things that have only been going on recently and it should be no coincidence that we're being hit from all sides. Class, race, sex/gender, wealth/income, intelligence, religion, etc. We have been divided on too many things when it's all bullshit.

              Most certainly, I couldn't agree with you more. I've always been for equal rights for all and have always treated people with the respect that I would like to be treated with myself, and we have seen a lot of great progress over the last couple of decades in that respect.  I do fear however though that there will be backlashes somewhere down the line, particularly with this rampant feminism that has come along, it's gone beyond equality and it's misandry now. It is ruining all the good work that has been done by true feminists over the years. Everything seems designed to divide us though you are right, and to distract many from what is really going on while they fight their corner on some lesser issues whilst missing something huge that's happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not particularly into rap myself but like you say we are being hit from all sides at the moment and I felt it was something I should research into because all the issues you listed seem to tie in with each other. It's definitely worth looking into I would say, it's certainly eye opening. There's plenty of good pieces on youtube about the matter.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not too sure about about the things we come in contact with being able to have a feminizing effect on men or there's a chance it would be effecting more guys like me and you too, but you can never put it past the globalists and if it was possibly then I'm sure they would certainly consider it. I did watch a documentary about fluoride in water though and in some places water tested contained many other things too, such as traces of growth hormones and estrogen.  You never can tell what's going on these days, there's so much happening it's hard to keep up.

            I completely agree that saturation of the food supply and environment with endocrine disruptors is a factor but it is one of many.  You also have the media constantly attacking and demonizing masculinity and traditional femininity, and celebrating androgyny, transexualism, and the like, the public education system and university system pushing post-modern Marxist bullshit of which demonizing gender roles and promoting identity confusion is a a major component, and of course the hideous beast that is feminism, demonizing masculinity, traditional femininity, the traditional family structure, seeking out and destroying any male-centered areas of private life that still exist, and desperately trying to criminalize normal male sexuality.  It's a massive assault on many fronts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately there are people realizing what's happening, and many others reacting against the bullshit without even fully comprehending the the scale of the problem or that it's being intentionally created.  All over the internet, on Youtube, on forums, and in my personal life, I've seen many great young men making a conscious effort to understand their masculinity and make themselves into someone they can be proud to be.  Guy's getting fit, learning practical skills to decrease their dependence on the system, learning a craft, growing their own food, connecting with nature, and consciously working to become respectable, self actualized, men - and not in the retarded-Bud-Light-and-football-meathead, or self-absorbed-emotionally-dead-bussiness-dick molds handed down through the mainstream media and society.  It's by no means as widespread as the culture of gender confusion but it's a real thing that I see growing around me and that gives me hope and makes me happy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, also, there are things you can do about xenoestrogens and endocrine disruption with your diet.  Cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, cabbage, etc.) are some of the best foods for removing xenoestrogens and encouraging testosterone production.  Beets are one of the best foods for helping your body with detoxification.  Generally, eat a ton of hardy vegetables.  One really easy way to get a bunch of greens in the morning and at times of the day when you don't feel like making or eating cooked vegetables (even though steaming just about any vegetable is literally the easiest, fastest way of cooking good food for yourself. Seriously, it takes 4 minutes from taking out the food to having it ready to eat, there's no way you can mess it up besides cooking it for too long, and you only have to rinse a single basically already clean pot for cleanup.  Microwave a potato or yam and make some eggs along side and you have a serious awesome meal that's very healthy, very good, and very cheap) is to make a large bach of greens-and-fruit smoothie in the morning and drink it throughout the day or whenever.  Also, there's some disagreement about the amount, but you should probably be supplementing LARGE amounts of vitamin d (up to 5000 IU daily).  It's plays an important role in regulating all sorts of hormonal processes in the body and a huge proportion of the population (even in extremely sunny areas) is chronically, drastically deficient.  A proper omega-3/6 ratio is also vital to the regulation of all sorts of hormonal and other processes in the body and it's another extremely common problem in people's diets. Take fish oil. Lastly, find a private place to do this one but... sun exposure on the genitals, even for just a few minutes, has been shown to drastically increase testosterone production for hours afterward.

             Lol @ sun exposure on genitals. I know exactly where I can go for that and no one would be the wiser. Going to keep that in mind and will document the effects. I've been doing some more reading and I'm actually going to try consuming maca consistently as it's a supplement I have yet to really take, but I hear that it works wonders for a lot of men.
            </p>
            <p>
             I like to think that there are always a good number of men who pursue manly things like what you mentioned. Also, I do hit the gym quite often and watch my diet. I've read that there are herbs that can detox xenoestrogens, and even something as simple as white button mushrooms apparently is a cheap and effective solution according to this site. I happen to consume a lot of broccoli (been getting organic broccoli for this recently), and I do eat like 3 eggs a day and take at least 2k IU of vitamin D from drops alone, as well as fish oil.

            Being exposed to the wrong hormones doesn't make someone transgender, it can make a person sick though. When a trans man takes testosterone or a trans woman takes hormones to help align their physical features with their mental gender they feel enormous relief; when a non trans person is exposed to hormones differing from their gender they often develop morbid depression (such as the case when Alan Turing was forced to take estrogen by the UK government for the then crime of being gay).
           </p>
           <p>
            We're seeing more trans and gay people because more are coming out of the closet because it's safer to do so now. There may be more media exposure to drum up discord and identity politics. In any case, people who happen to not be heterosexual or gender conforming aren't causing any harm, they're people just like everyone else. There's no evidence of a birth rate problem either, so it's not as if there humanity is in danger of extinction because there are trans and gay people; it also assumes that trans and gay people don't have families, which isn't true.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think a lot of men are discouraged from having a family because of the danger of divorce. But yea, xenoestrogens are bad for our health in that they can cause cancer and so on.

            Hmm very interesting. I've never heard a theory about this.. but it definitely gets me thinking. Do you have any relevant articles or research on this?  I feel its a pretty good possibility that  lot of gay and trans people be born as such but environmental impacts from hormone altering chemicals could be  contributing factor but it would be very hard to discern which ultimately affected the person's sexual/gender preferences. I doubt that it was pre-planned by the globalists but they are certainly sensationalizing the fuck out of this whole Bruce Gender thing... not sure what to make of it honestly.

             I don't know which specific articles to pull up, but there are many on Google that state the dangers of plastics and GMOs (and/or glyphosate). I just came to this conclusion after months of reading from various sources.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just find it curious that we have big oil and big ag that dominate their huge respective industries, where we get so much plastic made from big oil, and many crops that are being subsidized by the government and companies like Monsanto that grow GMO corn and soy. There is also the Monsanto Protection Act, wtf is up with that? Why those 2 crops in particular? GMO corn I've read also can lead to infertility as they tested it on lab rats. I think it's all engineered to get most unaware people sick from being addicted to the processed foods containing high amounts of those, and when people get sick from those, what do they do? They see a doctor. Then that doctor prescribes some meds courtesy of big pharma. Of course these meds will have side effects and cause cancer, the rates of which has only gone up over the years. Our lives are being put in this system by design. People go to school and get conditioned for this system at an early age to be submissive and obedient. Then in college get in massive debt. Then as adults if they even get to work, they work as cogs in the machine to produce more profits for the owners of big businesses. Then of course they get tired, sick and eventually too old and that is when they expire in the eyes of the owners. Now we have automation on the rise to take more jobs away from people and this is when they start culling the herd. Why keep people around anymore when robots will be more productive, and do not ask for money, food, space, or a happy life? Robots are also designed to be perfectly obedient to their masters and do not rebel like people do.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also have big lumber cutting down huge parts of the Amazon rainforest when we should and could be planting hemp, but that is another story.
            </p>
            <p>
             I might be paranoid but the globalists are people who hold the most power and know many secrets. They would be the first to know of knowledge they can use to exploit the population as this is a game they've been playing longer than anyone else. There are many things that they have planned for a long time and will continue unless they are stopped. When one has all the money, time and power in the world, what will they do? They will want more of course. And to get more for themselves they will need the rest of us to relinquish what we have or can ever hope to achieve.

<p>I had heard people accuse Andrew Anglin and the Daily Stormer of being shills before, but I never really believed them until yesterday. Here\'s the story of how I was banned from the forum and why I now think it is a disinformation hub.</p>
<p>You are all aware of the recent &quot;terror attack&quot; at Ohio State University. I believe this to be yet another psy-op hoax with no actual victims and a lot of bad actors, but whether or not you agree with this assessment is not important to this story so bear with me.</p>
<p>I visited The Daily Stormer a few times a week because some of the articles were really funny and I have been in some good discussions on the forums before, and there are often pretty good videos posted on the site aggregated from other outlets.  Yesterday there was a post related to the aforementioned Ohio State University incident and I made a comment basically questioning the mainstream media reports. I posted a couple videos of obvious crisis actors as well as a video from last year released by the campus safety department in conjunction with the OSU police, which starred the very same officer who is said to have stopped the terror attack by shooting the Somali refugee dead. This is too big of a coincidence for me, and I also posted an article from a few years ago about how OSU had recently beefed up its security surveillance system and expanded the number of security cameras on campus. My point was that if a car/machete attack had really taken place there should be ample video evidence of it as well as footage of the police shootout.</p>
<p>Well the guy who runs the site, Andrew Anglin, responded directly to my comment in a bizarre way - he called me mentally ill or schizophrenic, called me a whackjob, told me to fuck off, told me I was defending Somali terrorists, and was in short, very rude and unnecessarily vituperative.</p>
<p>I responded with 2 links where you can hire crisis actors online, one of which where you can even hire amputee crisis actors, proving that they do in fact exist. I also linked to the recent legislation that makes fabricated news stories legal for the American media to present to the public, as well as an article in which a former CIA officer disclosed that most terror attacks in the US in recent years had indeed been false flags. And since he had accused me of defending Somali terrorists, I added that in no way was I doing this and even said &quot;screw Somalis, I don\'t care if we deport them.&quot;</p>
<p>Well I was immediately banned from the forums for this, and Anglin went on to put in the comments that for those who had witnessed the ban, he had done so because I was &quot;defending Somalis&quot; and also said that I had said the earth was flat in other threads.</p>
<p>Both of these are lies - I clearly said I didn\'t care about Somali refugees, only seeing through media hoaxes and false flags, and that rather than being a flat-earther, I had actually clearly said I was not a flat-earther in other threads and even posted my favorite anti-flat earth video a couple times. I didn\'t care about being banned, but I didn\'t like the fact that he had made up 2 outright lies about me to justify the ban. I made another account quickly and said exactly this, that I didn\'t care about defending Somalis and that I was not a flat-earther and my past comments clearly said this. Well this new comment with my new account was removed and my new account banned, and I\'m assuming my IP is banned too.</p>
<p>Most of you are probably thinking, who cares, we don\'t like that neo-Nazi site anyway. Well I did some cursory research after this happened and it certainly seems it is a front for disinformation. Not only do they treat every false flag terror attack as though it is real, but I came to find out that he actually is still pushing the narrative that 19 Arabs did 9/11. He has made anti-white comments in the past and made a strong effort to have them removed from the internet, and also seems to have travelled on multiple occasions to the Philippines and engaged in underage prostitution.  He has also said that the feds have approached him multiple times so this begs the question of whether or not he is under their control now.</p>
<p>The consensus of his critics seems to be that the Daily Stormer is a post for herding all the low-IQ neo-nazis onto the same website where they can be monitored and fed disinfo. Considering how the website seems to be the most popular alt-right website, it goes to show how doomed the movement is that a person they consider to be one of their leaders is a 5\'2&quot; mongrel midget who apparently is participating in deliberate disinformation concerning 9/11 and every other false flag attack.  I used to think that the extreme anti-semitic rhetoric used on the site was an effort to be satirical for shock value, but now I tend to agree with those who think he is a sort of Hal Turner- style provocateur agent.</p>
<p>So there you go. I know many of you probably aren\'t familiar with the site, or don\'t care anyway, but perhaps some of you have opinions about this. I know my opinions changed yesterday and I thought this was bizarre and conspiratorial enough to share with you, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR got banned from the Daily Stormer\'s forums for questioning mainstream media story; Andrew Anglin then made up 2 bald-faced lies about why he banned me, and after digging some more I now feel that the place is infiltrated with disso ops.</strong></p>',

            One has to ask; how do these 'neo-nazi' sites stay online with the rise in censorship of social media? A case could be made that the more popular ones are being allowed to operate so the FBI, etc., can compile lists of visitors.

             Great point. Even when I was doing a little research I was Google searching for things like "andrew anglin disinfo" and "daily stormer disinfo shill" and "daily stormer cointel pro" and different combinations of things like that, the top results were usually articles from dailystormer.com! One has to wonder why they're being promoted so much. Weev (Andrew Auernheimer) has been in federal prison, Anglin has been questioned by feds apparently, so I have a hard time believing they weren't flipped at some point.

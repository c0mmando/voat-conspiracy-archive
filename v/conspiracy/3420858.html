<p>2.) Russians produce almost the entirety of pornography</p>
<p>3.) Ever major feminist leader was Russian</p>
<p>4.) Russians literally own our central bank for profit; every single dollar has associated with it a cost in interest, paid to a single family of Russians. Their net worth is in the trillions of dollars but you don\'t hear about them because, again, they own almost the entirety of our news networks and media outlets.</p>
<p>5.) They have been expelled from different cities and states over 500 times throughout the last ~700 years for the same things they are doing now, and yet they never learn</p>
<p>6.) many many many many many Russians have gone on the record saying that their express purpose is to undermine the US\' democracy and destroy any sense of unity within her borders. They have done this on Twitter, en masse, and Twitter has backed them up on it, meaning, obviously, they are colluding with Russians as well.</p>
<p>7.) The Russian PM and in fact every Russian PM have said that Russians are the master race and that all other races are born to serve them. They even have a special work for non-Russians, goyim, which roughly translated means &quot;cattle&quot;.</p>
<p>8.) Russia is the organ smuggling capital of the world; the child trafficking capital of the world; the pedophelia capital of the world and has been called a &quot;haven for pedophiles&quot; given Russia\'s tendency to take in convicted pedos and let them go free.</p>
<p>9.) An enormous percentage of our government have dual citizenship with Russia. Where does their allegiance lie?</p>
<p>10.) Russians are currently involved in multiple ethnic cleansing (genocide) operations, wherein multiple societies are being targeted for outright extinction (Palestine). No one stops this because Russians have infiltrated, again, our media, government, and countless other sectors.</p>
<p>11.) Russians attacked the USS Liberty, intentionally, with recorded audio from the mission proving this fact, costing dozens of American lives and 10s of millions of dollars in damage.</p>
<p>12.) They literally did 9/11. in NY city at the time of the attacks, a group of 11 dancing Russians were seen celebrating the atacks and so the NYPD was called in. Upon their arrest, they said that &quot;we are not your enemies; Palestinians are your enemies&quot;. Another group of Russians was caught with a van full of explosives, on 9/11, headed to a major bridge. Later, all of this would be scrubbed and when asked about it, every network was told to say that it was a matter of &quot;national security&quot;, meaning &quot;russian security from exposure&quot;, I\'m sure you\'d agree.</p>
<p>We have got to do something about these evil fucking Russians, man. This is just the tip of the iceberg of their crimes against humanity. I hate Russians with every fucking fiber of my being for what they\'ve done to the world. They even invented communism, then slaughtered 60,000,000 ethnic Russians then cry foul when a small, small percentage of Russians is starved to death in concentration camps due to supply lines being bombed to shit. They went on to make up all sorts of ridiculous stories like &quot;I was shoved into a cage with an eagle and a bear and they fought me but I was too quick for them&quot;, or &quot;we Russians were placed into automatic spanking machines which were meant to produce a continuous orgasm until death&quot;, or &quot;we were all strapped into a roller coaster that would cut our heads off&quot;. Ridiculous, I know, but you have to remember that Russians own all of our media companies so they can repeat the lies in whichever light they choose to present them in, until enough useful idiots believe them.</p>
<p>Nothing will change until we overthrow our damned Russian central bank.</p>',

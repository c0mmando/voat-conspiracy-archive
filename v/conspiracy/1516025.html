            What you should have done is empty the red pills contents into some Christmas cookies and had them eat those. Everyone appreciates cookies.

            Oh and we talked about immigration, how I think that if we spent the war money on fixing these places, we wouldn't have to take in so many, and that the people we take aren't even the poorest, they are the people who are smart and restless and would actually change their own countries if they stayed. Oh man, none of it went over well. The only thing we agreed on is that the elite pedophile ring is real.

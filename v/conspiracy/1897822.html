<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>I was a kid in the 80\'s growing up in Belgium, and one of the things anyone living in the 80\'s in Belgium remembers is The Nijvel Gang. A small group of gangsters performed a series of supermarket robberies, and some other heists, but were never caught.</p>
<p>They were extremely brutal, left many dead in their wake, and for small amounts of money, if any at all. The money was most likely not the reason, terror was more likely.</p>
<p>I remember my parents would drop me off at my grand parents before they went shopping, that is how terrified people were.</p>
<p>Until this day it remains a mystery who was behind The Nijvel Gang. There is still an ongoing investigation, rekindled after all these years, where a new team of investigators is going through all the evidence, trying to finally uncover the truth. But will they find it? Are they even allowed to find the truth?</p>
<p><em>The facts</em></p>
<p>Three gangsters, nicknamed the giant, the killer and the old man, committed the robberies, most likely with outside help of a few others to plan and obtain resources. The giant was a tall man, and according to witnesses acted as the leader. The killer got his name because he was the one who did most of the killing. Even children, trembling on the floor, at point blank range. The old man was the driver, who got away from police every time.</p>
<p>They had quite an arsenal of weaponry, none of it was ever found back. The cars were stolen, immediately dumped and burned out in remote locations like forests after the crime.</p>
<p>They managed to get away every time, escaping road blocks, pursuits, ... It\'s often speculated they had help from within to do so. Always able to find the one route of escape not blocked off.</p>
<p>The stolen money was never a lot, and sometimes even dumped by the gangsters right after the robbery. The money was too little for the force used, and never looked like it was the primary goal.</p>
<p>Until the last robbery, where a fire fight with a police patrol broke out, who randomly happened to arrive at the scene. One of the police officers claims he shot the giant in the head as they were escaping in a car. If not fatal, then very badly injured. Investigators now believe he survived but was executed by his companions because of his wounds. They even think they know where, but no body was ever found nearby, buried. The robberies stopped after this incident, so it\'s safe to assume he probably did die.</p>
<p>But no one fitting the description was ever reported missing. You would think someone somewhere would suddenly figure out he hasn\'t seen a tall man he knew since that day. But no, no one has come forward.</p>
<p><em>The theories</em></p>
<p>Many theories have been thrown around, many conspiracies, who and why.</p>
<p>Operation Gladio, a US stay behind network, is one. Creating fear to fight off communism growing in Europe. Left or right wing groups spreading terror to further their cause another possibility. There are as many theories as there are people who would have had even remotely a reason to be involved.</p>
<p>One thing that always comes back is involvement of the highest branches of Belgian government: politics, police, army, ... It seems likely they had help from people high up, were being covered up for, or even taken orders from. The only problem is that no one seems to know who and why.</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p>That these were no ordinary gangsters seems to be a given, but who and why has never been answered. Will it ever? At this point, someone who knows, telling the truth on their death bed seems to be the only way we will ever know.</p>',

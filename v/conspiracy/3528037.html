            Careful dude. My uncle had non-terminal cancer and picked alternative treatments which didn't work and ended up dying from it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The big one he was on was the Gerson Therapy. So stay away from shit like that.

             Exactly. Research the metabolic approach with repurposed and off-label drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are using scientifically proven compounds which target individual metabolic pathways of cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is an incredible amount of knowledge being shared. For example, this morning I just learned why Gets in therapy works well for fat loving melanoma but can exacerbate sugar feeding cancers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it's well discussed that many of those alternative natural methods will never hit all of the pathways. It takes a multi-targeted approach.
            </p>
            <p>
             If your uncle would have had access to these groups, he would have chosen a different approach and likely survived.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why they are trying to shut us down and take veterinary drugs away from the public.

            With consideration to your demographics:
           </p>
           <p>
            I would use a message board. You'd have to grow your own to avoid censorship.
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Register a domain name.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Get a free Amazon Web Server instance (you'll have to pay for a fixed IP and bandwidth).
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Find a decent BBS software package.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Stand up the service and advertise it on Facebook.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) Spend some time everyday policing the site for spam and illegal content.
           </p>
           <p>
            You want something easy to use as your target audience already has enough to deal with. A message board is the easiest thing I can think of at the moment.

             This^. FB and YT may be the biggest bullies on the block but there are other ways to get the message out there. I know on one of the forums I used to frequent the monthly rental at GoDaddy was only about $10 to host that forum. Do something like that and advertise it elsewhere. It would be a good place for others to show their experiences with alt treatments. Expect it to get attacked, though, by shills and idjits looking to take ya down but you can fight back if ya put the time and effort into it. FB is just gonna screw ya at every corner.

              Thanks. The advertising is covered. I am looking for a refuge for these people who will be lost if the FB groups get shut down. Word of mouth will bring the ones who are not yet on my mailing list.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not looking to profit, but also can't afford to spend a lot on a site. I guess I could set up a way to get members to donate towards the cost?

               Look into it hard. There's likely more help out there than you realize. Posts those links onto FB as long as it'll stay up and maybe it'll grow exponentially from there. The forum I mentioned was started because of another forum's moderating hypocritical bullshit and grabbed a bunch of their members to move over to the new forum and stayed valid for a long time before we all just got old and decided to shut it down but there was a lot of great info and opinions had while it was up. Where there's a will, there's a way and good luck.

              Another advantage if you use an open source software, is that you can back up the data, and just move it to another server if someone tries to take it down. phpBB for example, is a pretty common software, and it will be offered by many hosting providers with just a simple click-to-install system. No programming required. Then in an unlikely event that you need to move, you just download the forum database, and upload it to a new provider.

               You'll join? Do you want to help? I'm clueless and am only doing this to preserve the wealth of information. People are always looking for where to buy the supplements and drugs. I see nothing wrong with soliciting affiliate relationships with the popular vendors to help finance the site. I'm just so absolutely busy and overwhelmed.

               It is interesting. I feel like I've taken a crash course on a subject that I never wanted to know about. The great thing is that I've been able to share information which has helped someone make a remarkable turnaround in a short time. One in three people will have cancer and it's amazing to be able to offer some hope.

             So are swat teams that follow the orders of biznizz on my dime to commit harm and malice upon a free people. Wait...are we free...? Well...fuck... Since I knew all this shit in our world could give me cancer and I allowed it I'll allow the reaper to do his thing, too. I'm supposed to die, one day so I'm not gonna make it more miserable with treatment unless it's something I know I can beat easily without undue stress on my family. Just gonna do what I want to do until I can't do anymore then lock up and fall dafuq over like I'm supposed to. Hell, I'll get to see what's next before the rest. That's a win to me. It would be nice to see LE get the smackdown for supporting unrightful party's intrusion into our private lives before that happens, though. They, apparently, don't realize they are the real cancer upon our lives and have been since the beginnings of agriculture, which created Kings (most were tyrants), class divide and inequality, state control and theft, etc...and none of that could've happened without the need for "enforcement" and here we are still dealing with that bullshit and forced to pay for it or suffer imprisonment or death, at that. YAY LE!!!! not.

               It's the swat group use that I'm bitchin' about. Snake oil or not, that's a personal, private matter but LE use to intimidate/harass/jail upon private lives is the biggest cancer there is. Remove that then you have the free choice to try whatever treatments you want but noooooo.....not allowed.

                It's not snake oil. Talking about drugs proven in clinical trials and a multi-targeted approach to blocking cancer's metabolic pathways. This dismissive approach is why so many people subject themselves to being poisened by chemotherapy and laying down to die when it doesn't work.

                 Didn't say it's all snake oil. That's not the point. The point is you should be free to choose whatever method appeals to you because I agree, most treatments are bad for one's life and everyone is affected differently by whatever method taken. Generalization does not work very well amongst us humans. LE also uses generalizations and fails constantly because of it. There have been many who found ways to beat all kinds of cancers only to be suppressed, discredited, jailed or killed because of pushback by those who have no right to do so and facilitated by LE. Pick your fave version of LE, they are all guilty of unrightful, if not straight up evil, actions, at any given moment. I would much rather see private enterprise handle those duties like I'd rather see private enterprise offer alternative solutions to life problems like cancer. That way, their actions/responsibilities/results would all be determined by payer's choices and not dictat legislation and enforcement.

               What op is talking about is backed up by research that happens to not be widely (((publicized))).

               They are not 'snake oil cures'. Look into mebendazole/fenbendazole for cancer if you're interested.

               Also, chemotherapy contributes

                 The surprising replies are the result of brainwashed individuals or shills. Par for the course when there's a lot of money involved.

                 I wish you the very best in your fight dude and good to see you're not on the mainstream medical path which, as far as I can tell, is about taking your money
                 <em>
                  and
                 </em>
                 lengthening your suffering, so they can take more money.
                </p>

                 Also, look into gcmaf.

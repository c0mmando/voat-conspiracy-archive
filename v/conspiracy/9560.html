            I would love to get the list and use it to delete the accounts, but some of them are already restored and also there is no way for me to verify that your list would contain only the accounts you made and not usernames from regular people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best solution to this would be if you could remedy this on your own. I suggest you create a subreddit on reddit and post a link to
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            and deal with each individual yourself, giving them access to the accounts you made and verifying that they are who they say they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.

            I don't think that would be doable. Sending all those PMs would definitely trigger captchas and the bot wouldn't be able to send them all. Good idea though.

             I think you should either make a bot that deletes each account itself or do it manually -- leave Atko out of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I get bored, I just go look at porn, that usually picks me up... otherwise I disconnect and go outside to enjoy life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet we all make mistakes, what makes us better is that we man up, as you have, and fix our mistakes on our own accord. You're savvy enough to make that bot do all those things... use your powers for good :)

              I'm trying to do the right thing here, but I don't really have the time to spend on making another bot, or to give the username and passwords to everyone individually. If Atko doesn't want the list, then I guess that's it.

            I think it would make sense for you to publish the list of names (pastebin?) but not necessarily the passwords (that would be mayhem). Not sure what you should do re: passwords, as giving them to atko would create more work for him and hes already doing so much. Maybe he/we can appoint someone who has some spare time and can handle password requests on a case by case basis? Idk.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the very least I think you should be as forthcoming as possible re: who the bot targeted, how, and why, if there really was no malintent behind your actions.

             I think sending a csv file directly to Atko would probably be the best way, since then he can very easily run a quick script to delete the accounts, and make the usernames available again. But I can do whatever method is asked of me.

             And yes.. there wasn't any malicious intent. I was bored on a Sunday and decided to write it. I shouldn't go into details of 'how' unless you want more attempts at such bots.

              If hes ok with that than so am I, but I strongly believe that the list of names targeted should be made public as well so that we know who was targeted.

               You won't get any particular benefit from knowing that. It didn't target any particular users, the process was mostly random, it looked for people who had commented in

                 The bot generated some posts by mixing posts from
                 <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/sex">
                  /r/sex
                 </a>
                 and

                  /r/conspiracy
                 </a>
                 and posted them,  but it was stopped pretty quickly by disabling making posts by new accounts. But your account isn't in the list that my bot made, it must've been grabbed by someone else.

                Hard to say without having access to the data. 'mostly random' is not very precise and there is a lot of meaningful variation among

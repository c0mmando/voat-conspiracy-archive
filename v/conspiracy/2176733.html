            I’ve asked myself these same thing for years! If all the fuel was burned up in the initial impact and explosion how could there be enough left to  “trickle down” (Hillary oughta love this question!) and cause the rest of the steel to melt?
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s one or the other.

            Why would all the fuel be gone? Not all of it would be ignited in an explosion, the jet fuel for airplanes should be similar to the fuel for cars, and that fuel isn't what makes an explosion. The vapor from the fuel causes an explosion and then the gasoline burns. At most you would get the fuel thrown everywhere from the explosion.

            <p>
             Thank you for answering what I was asking.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said-That's the part I'm saying I Don't get. So still based on your answer- I disagree with you... I am Not saying you're wrong- But I'm saying How can that be possibly?
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously am not qualified to explain why I disagree with you- Hence my initial question. lol
            </p>
            <p>
             But your answer just doesn't make sense to me. Now- I know even less about jet fuel- than I do regular Fuel... But lets just assume It's basically the same...I.e The vapors are what's explosive... But the fuel Itself is still flammable.
            </p>
            <p>
             So how does Some of the fuel result In the explosion- And The rest of the fuel Escapes the explosion without even Igniting
             <sub>
              (And I mean Catching FIre-Not saying exploding)
             </sub>
            </p>
            <p>
             I know very little about Skyscrappers- Planes- or fuel... But my ignorant ass can not comprehend how fuel Escapes an explosion and subsequent fire..
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Like does that happen? Is there an example of that happening or a clear explanation of how this could be possible? And I guess that explanation would have to account for the relevant variables in this situation... I have to assume an explosion in the middle of an open field- would increased the likely hood of fuel escaping unscathed- Versus In a confined space.
             </em>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I mean Wouldn't it have to be in two separate Gas tanks... One of which- Remained completely intact
             <sub>
              (even though the entire plane basically disinterested AGAIN- I'm speaking to the scenario we are given- And the explanations used to rebut that scenario)
             </sub>
            </p>
            <p>
             Shielding the fuel Inside from the explosion like that as well as escape the subsequent fire caused by the first fuel tank.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then after surviving  all of that- It rolls over to the elevator  where it then Breaks open and drains down the shaft.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              How does Fuel Escape an explosion that- without contributing to the explosion-or being subsequently burned up in the aftermath of said explosion.

              If you think about how a Molotov works that is a close representation of what would most likely to occur. You get an initial flare up from the fumes catching fire, and then the subsequent fuel burning. The plane would also acted like the Molotov by dumping it fuel everywhere when the container burst on impact.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason you would still have fuel is because the fuel isn't explosive. If anything the fuel would have a dissipating effect of the flames, much like if you doused it in water. From what I have read, the fuel used for planes is similar to that of diesel, and that is hard to catch fire. I've been told that you can pour diesel on a fire and actual put it out. You can light diesel on fire but it requires a high amount of heat to do so. And then when you get it lit it generally burns hotter longer than a thinner flammable.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you would like to do an experiment, try lighting motor oil on fire. I would wager that it would be rather hard to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only thing I am surprised at is the size of explosion that those planes produced.

            Whenever fuel burns, explosion or not, it is only the atomized fuel that's burning. That is it's only the fuel that's either in vapor form or at least misted in the air. Pools of fuel burn much more slowly and depending on the depth of the pool in relation to it's exposed surface area it could burn for a very long time. You could literally throw a lit match into an open container of fuel and not have it vaporize in an explosion like you'd imagine from movies. if the container is starved of oxygen, like a gas can with a long spout to toss the match down, the match can even be doused out in the pool and never ignite the fuel. Point is that only the vapor, evaporating, or at least misted fuel burns so there could potentially be fuel burning in those buildings for a very long time.

            <p>
             Do you mean there could be fuel in the building for a very long time- BEFORE Burning...?
            </p>
            <p>
             Or do you mean the fuel itself burns For a long time? Because once It does ignite... I'd have to imagine it burns up relatively quickly and It's now the material that was already in the building that continues to burn. Or are you saying if there were pools Of fuel- those pools of fuel could burn for a long time.

             In an arson Fire- Gasoline is used as an accelerante- But Doesn't it burn Up relatively quickly? It's just that It accelerated the burning Of whatever else was already in the house?

              Right... So I'll start at the beginning of your latest questions. Also, to be clear, none of what I'm saying is meant to dispute or support the official story nor any alternative theories. Too many people get emotional about this shit and fail to grasp simple isolated concepts independent of other possible contributing factors.

              Yes, it's all relative information. But it's easiest to examine the components before assembling the related information. To reiterate, there's no explosion in the container scenario because there's no oxygen, or at least not enough. Even if there is an explosion there still remains spatters of liquid fuel. Liquid fuel doesn't burn, only its vapors burn.
             </p>

             <p>
              Not all of it. These jets had recently taken off for international flights and had hundreds of gallons in their tanks. Again, liquid fuel doesn't burn, only it's vapors.

             <p>
              Not before. Because of the spillage of fuel from the destroyed plane, the fuel would burn for as long as its liquid form would take to evaporate and mix with available oxygen. More oxygen, faster burn. More fire and smoke means less oxygen, slower burn and lower holding capacity in the air for fuel to evaporate into it. This slows the evaporation, contributing to a slower burn off.

              Imagine a smaller scenario, lighter fluid on coals in a grill. The coals take a while to get hot enough to ignite. They can reach the necessary temperature because the lighter fluid is slowly evaporating and not just flashing into flames all at once. Here's the fun part... The lighter fluid burns at a lower temperature than the coals ignite at. The fluid is releasing stored energy quickly, that's evident as flames. The coals are then absorbing energy faster than they can dissipate it. When the energy absorbed in the coals  reaches levels as high as the energy required for ignition that's the moment ignition of the coals occurs.

             It's not just the fuel, it is also the metal. Aviation grade aluminum creates it's own oxygen when it catches fire. The powder is also an ingredient in thermite.

              Are you drunk? You don't need to argue whether or not jet fuel contributed or how, as building 7 wasn't hit by a plane and still came down just like the others.

             Really though, nobody is going to listen about 9/11 being a false flag any more than las vegas shooting, humans are programmed through the media what to believe, the educational system obliterates their ability to use their imagination and question reality.

            You can't forget how the buildings collapsed, the collapse was not controlled. The damage exposed the steel and the jet fuel and plastic materials inside the building compromised the balloon framing of the building and the mass above the impact caused the implosion.

            Jet fuel Open Air Burn temperature: 1,030 °C (1,890 °F)
            <br/>
            Iron, out of the ground, melts at around 1510 degrees C (2750°F). Steel often melts at around 1370 degrees C (2500°F).
            <br/>
            So jet fuel wont melt the steel. but you do not need to melt steel for it to loose it's strength. Steel heated to a few hundred degrees significantly weakens the steel and makes it more pliable.

              Your second point is the only part I question as well - I don't see why truthers think the beams had to be turned into molten steel (melting point) before the weight they could support decreased.

              But yeah, I would expect the top part of the building to fall in a different motion compared to the area below where the plane struck that still had full support.

   Climate Change is obviously real, but is it man made? Better question, is AGW a conspiracy to enact a global tax system that charges you for industrial production or pays you not to produce?

            I'm on the fence about man's involvement in this, I dare say we have an effect but I suspect it's negligible, reducing carbon does have the added bonus of discouraging dirty practices in big business, less coal burning for a start and hopefully more emphasis on renewables at the expense of big oil and other globalist endeavours. Negative impacts could be employment however, tricky. The obsession with wealth at the expense of fellow humans and their own children's future is the main problem though.

            And as a comedian said "what if we made the planet a fit place to live FOR NO REASON?! That'd be awful."

             I think as usual there is a glimmer of truth in the official story.  AGW may in fact be partially accelerated by human activities.  Its probably not the activities being claimed and any "global tax" enacted will be used to benefit a select few already rich people.

             There is so much mud in the water these days its hard to tell what is worthy of consideration.

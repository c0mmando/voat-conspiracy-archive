            First, why are you posting this farewell here? Second, why should I care? Thirdly, you go on to spout claims without any supporting evidence. For example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Conspiracies are a form of cognitive dissonance used by those who can’t fathom that their non-evidence and science-based opinions are wrong.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Conspiracies cannot be a form of cognitive dissonance. For example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal - definition from
             <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy">
              Merriam-Webster
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            By that definition, conspiracies happen most of the time. There are even
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_%28criminal%29">
             laws against committing conspiracies.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I am sure you probably meant conspiracy theories are a form of cognitive dissonance, but even then you never cited any research to support your claim. Being the curious type, I looked to your past posts. For instance:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/08/the-psychology-of-conspiracy-theories/">
             Conspiracy theorists and cognitive dissonance
            </a>
            Yet that post cites no claims and instead builds up a strawman based on a case where a woman started a type of cult where they believed that the world was going to end. That has nothing to do with conspiracy theory yet the original writer decided to lump it together with the idea of theorizing about potential conspiracies.
           </p>
           <p>
            I then, out of curiousity, changed the whoaverse.com/u/ to reddit.com/u/ to find, not surprisingly, that you are a regular poster of
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
             /r/conspiratard
            </a>
            . I am shocked. /s
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I'll leave the following here:

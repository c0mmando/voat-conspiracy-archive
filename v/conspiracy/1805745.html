Both images stand on the premise of black poverty, and incarceration. My interpretations reveal an egyptian eye, sexual slavery imagery and &quot;heart&quot; messaging. I have the magazine if anyone wants closer ups than this.&lt;br&gt;
This picture out of variety magazine 2015 article about women tv show writers this one woman called Yenji, writes orange is the new black. I never watched it. I noticed the white reflection in the photo was hand worked. The handiwork of man. Not camera.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;
<a href="https://ibb.co/ikCnak">https://ibb.co/ikCnak</a>&lt;br&gt;

Heres the same image zoomed in without my drawing on it yet.&nbsp; <a href="https://ibb.co/dd6Ko5">https://ibb.co/dd6Ko5</a>&lt;br&gt;

I saw the egyptian eye first <a href="https://ibb.co/gZuavk">https://ibb.co/gZuavk</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Heres the same image with lines i made to complete some of the imagery. To the right bottom corner there&apos;s a smaller scale figure with giant tits and a big dick holding an enormous pen, writing with it. It was then when I saw the egyptian eye. <a href="https://ibb.co/cxqOFk">https://ibb.co/cxqOFk</a>&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the same image without any lines drawn at all but put thru the negative ap on my phone which also brings out the imagery just as is.&lt;br&gt;
<a href="https://ibb.co/hSDX85">https://ibb.co/hSDX85</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Without making any lines yet I zoomed in on the same image after I put it thru the&nbsp; negative ap on my phone. A shattered face looking thru bars, also a shattered in two emaciated figure, wearing the two heart sunglasses and a heart with a cross inside it and a heart with a tiny heart inside it. <a href="https://ibb.co/c0zpo5">https://ibb.co/c0zpo5</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Orange is the New black writer yenji in variety mag 2015 image detail after i found four&nbsp; hearts and out lined them. They are very small but they are there. I outlined the hearts in red liner the other few lines I made are in black. One&nbsp; starving child inside a cell there is the shape of a door behind the child, like a room. shattered art style reminds me of wells fargo art contest winners style <a href="https://ibb.co/ex7aT5">https://ibb.co/ex7aT5</a>&lt;br&gt;

Heres the wells fargo art contest winner style this art reminds me of. <a href="https://ibb.co/dDzuMQ">https://ibb.co/dDzuMQ</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The same image zoomed up and drawn on to pull out the larger face with one eye staring out a lopsided frame. <a href="https://ibb.co/f3deMQ">https://ibb.co/f3deMQ</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I&apos;ll do one more from that exact same magazine just up a few pages. Magazines have a strange way of linking every single square inch with thematic messaging. Every page is different but repeating the same message.&nbsp; This photo with an article titled Straight outta Compton. The photo is&nbsp; Black men walking. &lt;br&gt;
<a href="https://ibb.co/dXvb1Q">https://ibb.co/dXvb1Q</a>&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I closed right in on the white streaks on the wall, they looked like Arabic writing. Here&apos;s the plain photo no lines yet. &lt;br&gt;
<a href="https://ibb.co/gVEfT5">https://ibb.co/gVEfT5</a>&lt;br&gt;
Then I saw two figures, one figure way smaller, engaged in oral copulation. <a href="https://ibb.co/kRZEo5">https://ibb.co/kRZEo5</a> &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I outlined it one more more carefully time to be sure. There&apos;s the seam on the the wall that works perfectly as a button down shirt, pants open small headed figure giving falatio to larger&nbsp; taller figure who&apos;s hand is hanging diwn. On the wall right next to the black man.&lt;br&gt;

Its art done by the same artist that did the first photo  above by the style they have it&apos;s kind of got that India flame thing,</p>',

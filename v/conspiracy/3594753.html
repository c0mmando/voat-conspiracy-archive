<p>I\'m a 20 year old male living in New Zealand(south island to be exact), living with my father, working full time and about to start studying.</p>
<p>So I had just finished work on the Friday that has just passed and I got offered a 13-14 hour shift at a music festival(Bay Dreams). it is quite a large event and quite expensive, keep in mind that nz is already one of the most heavily taxed countries so you aren\'t paying that much for a good event.</p>
<p>Anyway I took up the offer and started work the day after on Saturday. It was okay nothing really too difficult, but after being there for about an hour I started feeling weird(I am also a fond believer that we are in a spiritual war), in the way that my mind started thinking differently and I just wasn\'t myself.</p>
<p>Then the music started playing, and i would say about 90% had what I would consider a \'hypnotic melody\' followed by an insanely basey beat, a lot of kicks and snares and a witch or devil looking performer. Everyone was loving it, probably not giving it a second thought and up until this point its probably just me being(or trying) to be conscious to all of the elite tricks that we see everyday.</p>
<p>Then I walked over to the other stage that had a few big name performers(you can probably Google the line up), mainly Skepta and Tyler, the creator. I heard Skepta say \'if you are down with the devil, raise your hands to the sky\' I couldn\'t believe it as majority of the people there cheered and raised their hands, he said it one more time before his time on stage was finished. I had a few drinks and it hadn\'t really set in that, that actually just happened, in real life, and nobody cared at all.</p>
<p>So today all i\'ve been thinking about is, are music festivals really only there to make money, or is it something much bigger than that. I personally believe that it is a mass brainwashing event to keep people dumb and to be with satan.</p>
<p>I have been trying to research this topic but google and youtube are quite heavily censored and I feel that even if I find someone talking about it, it\'s probably false since I can still see it. I\'m really in a weird place as I dont want to be with Satan, I have prayed a lot to God, and Jesus respectively to no avail, I\'m not looking for him to come down and shake my hand but surely there is something that someone else has experienced in relation to all of this.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who can give me some info about these music festivals, or have I developed some kind of schizophrenia that stops me from living and thinking like everyone else. Either way i\'m really hoping someone can answer some of my questions and sorry if this is a mess to read, i\'m really tired. Thanks and bless</p>',

            If you listen to Tyler the creator in his interviews he doesn't much like organized religion. In the usa we have religious freedom and there you have it.

            The fact that you recognize the evil means Jesus is guiding you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its very subtle but the more you pray and follow the will of God, the more you notice the battle between good and evil in everything.

            I feel you 100%. It's being promoted. It's why I don't watch TV, I don't have social media. Voat and 4chan is where I go, due to the lack of censorship. Because it's being promoted everywhere. There's nothing promoting kindness in today's culture. It's all about money, fame, and killing people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep the divine spark inside you beautiful and untainted by this dark world.

            Hey guys, I work in the entertainment / festival industry. You know what? He’s right. So fucking right. It’s fucking ludicrous how much this stuff prevails. These assholes are literally out there wearing robes and chanting and taking soul opening drugs. I’ve seen it! Dark imagery and throbbing repetitive beats. Idiots have no idea what they are doing... Yup. All true. I have eyes to see and I can corroborate what this kid feels. Fuck music festivals and their edgy bullshit. I stopped working them a long time ago.

            "So today all i've been thinking about is, are music festivals really only there to make money, or is it something much bigger than that. I personally believe that it is a mass brainwashing event to keep people dumb and to be with satan."
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to give you my thoughts on your question, but first I feel that I have to explain the background of my thoughts on the matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that consciousness is fundamentally a construct. A sum of its lesser elements, of which are sums of their lesser elements, ad infinitum. Therefore I don't believe in the "self" being a single conscious element, but rather a construct of many lesser elements that align with respect to each other. I believe that is what past philosophers have always tried to hint at, what chakras/polytheism/yggdrasil/etc try to demonstrate, and what modern psychology concludes to. That seems (to me) to be the obvious nature of what makes up the world around us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also believe that consciousness represents an element being in possession of its own internal drive, and thus the stability of a greater consciousness exists in sympathy to its lesser elements. Like the overall harmony and dissonance within a symphony being an reflection of the various contentions between instruments.
           </p>
           <p>
            So with all that being said:
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been to a lot of music festivals, raves, warehouse shows, you name it. And I have seen the symbology of 666, pentagrams, illuminati eye, triangle of power, and various other esoteric symbols. I have seen them as tattoos, as artwork, album covers, in music videos, stickers, murals, song lyrics, everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe with 100% certainty that the VAST majority of people who practice in the esoteric, and even demonic behavior, are people whom are being possessed by these dark forces, are allowing themselves to be possessed, and are not consciously aware that they are being possessed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that our reality is quite strange, there may be some real scientific (yes, seriously) basis for the occult, and that our ancient (beyond 20,000+ years) ancestors may have followed a much different path than we have when it comes to understanding the nature of reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            That also being said, I believe the vast majority of people who practice the occult, such as paganism/witchcraft/kabbalah/etc. have, at best, a 0.01% idea of what they are doing. They are people grasping at the straws of lost knowledge, barely able to hear echoes of the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our modern human bodies are (obviously) the product of highly advanced eugenic practices that took place over the course of hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years. No other life form even comes close to the sophistication of human biology.
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone were in possession of even 0.01% of the "user manual" of eugenic practices which evolved the modern man, I feel that would be more than enough to put together how to manipulate and control people en-masse. Our bodies are the most complex engineering feat man has ever created, more advanced than anything science has even come close to achieving (and a lot of discovery results from simply studying our own nature).
           </p>
           <p>
            And being a human being who lacks the knowledge, the depth and breadth of how your biology functions across various dimensions (sexual/social/economic/spiritual/creative/sensory/instinct/etc) you run at a very high risk of inadvertently being tangled in "bad habits" and negative feed-back loops, even environmental ones that lack any hidden-hand behind them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So with all that being said (this is a stream of consciousness, please excuse the poor formatting):
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's very easy to prescribe what you are seeing to evil spirits, demonic entities, black magic, and even the penultimate Satan himself. But regardless of whether that may be literal truth, I think what is undeniable is these ideas are useful as "classifiers" to describe what we are observing: A collective of conscious behaviors which appear to be in possession of the people i.e tail wagging the dog. I feel the vast majority of these people do not have much control over their own bodies or behaviors, even when these behaviors prove to be destructive to the individual. And it may be possible that, due to the nature of consciousness itself, these behaviors can develop a life of their own.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an aside, a lot of these behaviors appear (to me) to be focused on stimulating the right hemisphere of our brains into subverting the left, and the frontal lobe being subservient to more primitive regions of the brain (primitive not being derogatory). I believe that is why a lot of occultist symbology develop around covering one eye or one side of the face, and using subliminal messaging. (the star of david, or seal of solomon, is the prime symbol for using sacred geometry to encode a hidden construct).
           </p>
           <p>
            If these beliefs resonate with you, I hope I have given some clarity on what to search for.

            While God is the Creator of all things, people have a hard time grasping the fact that Satan inherited the Earth as his throne when he was cast out of Heaven.
           </p>
           <p>
            While my username suggests we as a people are fucked, the truth is with God on our sides we have nothing to worry about in this short, temporary life. And those who truly believe in Christ should look forward to the day of His return whether it be now or 100 years from now, for the most evil of men will have no choice but to bow at his presence.

            the music industry turns out absolutely nothing of redeeming value at this point. anyone listening to the sort of bands that get booked for huge festivals these days is a retard with poor taste. what you watched was a rally for the NPC army - most of the people there have zero idea what the entire thing is about and more than half are just there because it's where the party is and everyone is gathering. given orders, that half won't march.

            I don't know if this will be available in nz but try to watch "What on Earth os going on?" Lecture by Mark Passio on youtub. It's about 9-10 hours of the most valuable info you will find anywhere. People are waking up to the spiritual world, but it is hard to navigate as lies have propagated it to keep us ignorant for thousands of years. Cheers brother

             yeah brother, one thing to realize the world, its completely different thing to tap into that energy(if you even can!). That is something I am struggling with. I personally feel like i am constantly being talked to or needed in the spiritual realm, but I am yet to figure out how to tap into this other world. bless you bro

            Wow! You
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            an old soul. I’m sad that people would be so mesmerised as to reach up their hands to the devil, that is shocking! I go to small, local music festivals but they are completely different than commercially-driven events... as long as you wear the armour of God and have Jesus in your heart, I think sharing your observations of things like this help us all remember how insidious the devil can be... thank you!!

            Lucifer was the leader of the music in heaven before being cast out.  If you are a born again Christian, read your Bible and pray.  But if you're not a born again Christian, you must be born again spiritually.  That means acknowledging you're a sinner, believe that Jesus died for your sins, and confess with your mouth that Jesus is God. I feel like He is reaching out to you, please accept His free gift of salvation if you haven't already.

            There are a few documentaries on Burning Man festival, some mainstream (which are mainly good for footage of the events) and some conspiracy vids on YouTube, sorry I don't remember titles.
           </p>
           <p>
            But burning man is a good place to start as its much more obvious what they are doing there and they have a huge budget too so they go all out.

                Boomer?  Okay...  Um...  Sure I guess if that's what you want to think.  You're wrong, but go ahead and think it if it makes you feel better over being corrected.
               </p>
               <p>
                All this rage over being corrected.  Mhm...  No, son.  You're the entire part of the problem.

            <p>
             So a little bit about myself before I dive into this subject.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm a 20 year old male living in New Zealand(south island to be exact), living with my father, working full time and about to start studying.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I had just finished work on the Friday that has just passed and I got offered a 13-14 hour shift at a music festival(Bay Dreams). it is quite a large event and quite expensive, keep in mind that nz is already one of the most heavily taxed countries so you aren't paying that much for a good event.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway I took up the offer and started work the day after on Saturday. It was okay nothing really too difficult, but after being there for about an hour I started feeling weird(I am also a fond believer that we are in a spiritual war), in the way that my mind started thinking differently and I just wasn't myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then the music started playing, and i would say about 90% had what I would consider a 'hypnotic melody' followed by an insanely basey beat, a lot of kicks and snares and a witch or devil looking performer. Everyone was loving it, probably not giving it a second thought and up until this point its probably just me being(or trying) to be conscious to all of the elite tricks that we see everyday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then I walked over to the other stage that had a few big name performers(you can probably Google the line up), mainly Skepta and Tyler, the creator. I heard Skepta say 'if you are down with the devil, raise your hands to the sky' I couldn't believe it as majority of the people there cheered and raised their hands, he said it one more time before his time on stage was finished. I had a few drinks and it hadn't really set in that, that actually just happened, in real life, and nobody cared at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             So today all i've been thinking about is, are music festivals really only there to make money, or is it something much bigger than that. I personally believe that it is a mass brainwashing event to keep people dumb and to be with satan.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been trying to research this topic but google and youtube are quite heavily censored and I feel that even if I find someone talking about it, it's probably false since I can still see it. I'm really in a weird place as I dont want to be with Satan, I have prayed a lot to God, and Jesus respectively to no avail, I'm not looking for him to come down and shake my hand but surely there is something that someone else has experienced in relation to all of this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there anyone who can give me some info about these music festivals, or have I developed some kind of schizophrenia that stops me from living and thinking like everyone else. Either way i'm really hoping someone can answer some of my questions and sorry if this is a mess to read, i'm really tired. Thanks and bless

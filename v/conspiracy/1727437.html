            In the late 1990s, Virginia Roberts was recruited to perform a massage for Epstein while working as a $9-per-hour locker room attendant at Mar-A-Lago (at 15 yrs. old - Florida legal working age is 16). (Groomed and culled from Mar-a-Lago by Trumps lesbian/hebophile friend Ghislaine Maxwell, who implicitly works for Jeffrey Epstein). Roberts' father also worked at Mar-A-Lago, which is located about 3 miles away from Epstein's estate, as a maintenance manager.

            Michael Glassner (above) arranged the deal that gave the lease of the World Trade Center to the Larry Silverstein Group.[7]
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael Glassner, formerly of AIPAC, is now Donald Trump's top political planner
           </p>
           <p>
            Fifty days before 9/11, Larry Silverstein's Silverstein Properties and Frank Lowy's Westfield America secured a 99-year lease on World Trade Center Buildings One, Two, Four and Five. Silverstein already owned Building Seven.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silverstein and Westfield America insured the WTC complex for $3.55 billion, but after the attacks of September 11 lodged a claim for $7.1 billion on the premise that each plane collision constituted a separate act of terrorism, doubling the payout.
           </p>
           <p>
            About $5.4 billion went into the pockets of Lowy and Silverstein.

            In Atlantic City, Trump bought a property, at twice its market value, from Salvatore Testa, of the Mafia.

            Trump Plaza was built on that site.

            Mafia companies helped to build Trump Plaza.
           </p>

            The Mafia controlled the bartenders union, which represented Trump's workers in Atlantic City, according to George Anastasia's book, 'Blood and Honor.'
           </p>
           <p>
            In New York City, several of Trump's buildings were built by S&amp;A Concrete Co., a concern partly owned by the Mafia's Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Trump and Salerno were both represented by the attorney Roy Cohn.

            MORGELLON'S SYNDROME (Condition)
           </h2>
           <p>
            About 10 years ago someone was doing some web sleuthing to determine what was causing interesting physical symptoms. They had the feeling that their skin was crawling; not to any extreme but it was uncomfortable. In their searching they stumbled upon this VERY interesting page on the
            <strong>
             National Institutes of Health
            </strong>
            website...
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/7b4foj.jpg">
             https://files.catbox.moe/7b4foj.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            To produce a "source" for the above image isn't possible because the original page is gone without record. However, the information on the page in the image is the seal of its authenticity. I'll explain further on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The person who first found the page at NIH had no reason to think it was special, and they were oblivious to things like chromosomes, etc. But they had seen the name "Morgellons" mentioned in a forum, which people were associating with a skin condition of some kind. So they called the Hotline number provided. When they mentioned they were looking at the Morgellon's hotline page, the NIH employee said,
            <em>
             "That's not correct. That's not supposed to be there. That's just for physicians."
            </em>
            About 2 weeks later the page was gone.

            MORGELLON'S SYMPTOMS
           </h2>
           <p>
            Most people experience the growth of very tiny fibers from skin pores on large portions of their body. Fewer people experience very uncomfortable sensations of crawling under their skin. In the worst cases, lesions form as long as 16" in length. These lesions must be cleaned daily and bandaged in order to prevent infection or worse. When open wounds form due to the condition, it's often better to prevent the wound from healing. The wound or lesion will simply migrate or become worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fibers most commonly appear in clear, red and blue and grow very quickly. They are sometimes rigid enough to require being pulled out or shaved off.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <h2 id="md-precondition-for-morgellons">
            PRECONDITION FOR MORGELLON'S
           </h2>
           <p>
            Thanks in part to the NIH's mishap, we now know that there is a precondition for someone to develop Morgellon's Syndrome. They MUST have a particular chromosome in triplicate (Trisomy). Maybe that screen-cap is shopped? Totally possible. But, how then can we explain how it identifies the specific chromosome trisomy that causes the Morgellons condition?
           </p>
           <p>
            I applied for and was accepted to volunteer for the Carnicom Institute, founded by Clifford Carnicom. During my time there both he and another researcher had cultured morgellons fibers, which grew very fast. I saw under the microscope that they weren't carbon-based, but silicon. And as I knew from some accounts, the fibers were a mix of clear, red and blue.
           </p>
           <p>
            And get this...the condition begins when red blood cells begin to grow small bumps on their surface, like a Boston baked bean. They should be smooth. When Clifford noticed this with people who had the gene trisomy, he saw his own blood had it. Then he found it in pets and other animals. Lastly, plant cells had the same anomaly.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It has already taken root in all 3 domains of life,
            </strong>
            whatever it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you can guess why Morgellons can NEVER be acknowledged. Sadly, it also can never be treated and often leads to psych meds. There are professional sports figures, actors and business leaders who have dropped out of the public eye after acquiring the condition. But smart folks have developed their own protocols and figured out how to live with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks to Clifford Carnicom, we now have a lead to pursue that further points to the source of this incredibly obscure and disturbing problem. Here is a link to the Morgellon's Research Project, which was overseen by the Carnicom Institute and probably the most legitimate document on the subject, given its conspiratorial nature.

             It would probably be illegal to try and TREAT those people, but what if you just got them in touch and documented all their symptoms for public review?

              Well that's kind of what Carnicom has done, in that survey project I linked at the bottom of my post. It was mostly a survey of symptoms. I think it revealed a LOT of participants were not truly sufferers, FYI. It's not that important, but paranoid or delusional people are always going to make issues like this more challenging.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think you're on the right track, but the public review part is not the magic trick some may think. The establishment still has a strong desire to maintain its secrets. Its stock in trustworthiness is currently at rock bottom. The system makes the rules and is terrible at relinquishing that authority.

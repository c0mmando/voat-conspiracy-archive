           To begin with a remarkable contact "Jason" in a Voronenkov's mobile phone occurred to be a CIA station chief in Kiev Jason A. Stock.

Voronenkov was a perfect target for the intelligence development due to his social and property status and his access to official secrets and national security information, wide connections in Russian establishment and business and his wife's significant role in media space and forged contacts with Russian clerisy on the top of everything else.

            Michael Moore is an effluential obstruction of the foulest order.
           </p>
           <p>
            My old man (who I would nominate as a world class shit bag in his own right) was part of the GM Security/Management team from the mid '60s through the early '90s. Due specifically to that fat fuck Moore's 'documentary' fabrication, he spent several years from around the late '70s to the mid '80s as part of Roger Smith's personal security detail. What Moore didn't show in his little 'film' (that one he used to catapult his miserably useless fat ass to fame with) was that he made dozens of appointments with Smith, and then failed to show up for
            <strong>
             Each and Every One
            </strong>
            of them (despite Smith and his people actually setting aside their valuable time for this unknown, pseudo-journalist, syphilitic discharge). He would at later times show up at random GM security checkpoints and start squawking about how he had 'appointments' with Roger Smith - and with cameras rolling - demand an immediate audience with the CEO of (at the time) the world's largest corporation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Consults that occurred re fat blob Moore's behaviour during that period, went as high as the FBI. GM security were advised by multiple levels of LE agencies that Moore appeared to be a threat, but lacked actionable specificity. Watching "Roger and Me" with knowledge of the actual events, turns it into an horrifying cringefest, where you're constantly amazed by the deference and restraint that he was shown by GM security personnel who should have just shot the fat fuck when he started going full retard.

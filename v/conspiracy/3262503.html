<p>I am surely not advocationg violence, but the focus should obviously be on the physical integrety, see the point regarding LAW in the Blog How to save.. where a interconnected template of simple societal rules is laid out, which can ( especially if implemented – Blog on Implementation ! – together ) solve many pressing problems, and instead the most ridiculous “crimes” like hatespeech are are used to imprision – and that is how it works:</p>
<p>inundate the media and thus publice discurse, with these psyop words.</p>
<p>as soon enough people accept them, they become a new social standard.</p>
<p>then through complicit politicians – see Blog one how to solve this – it becomes enactable law</p>
<p>(the threat of it is often enough for self censorship, but it helps occasionally “ein beispiel zu statuieren” off course) people!</p>
<p>Other buzzwords used as mindtraps so to speak include “refugee crisis” to drown out the more precise “replacement migration”.</p>
<p>Here a sidenote is warranted:</p>
<p>The EU, with scant democratic legitamicy, could have been a fine example tolerance and peacefull cooperation, the road to be taken was countries with</p>
<p>similar economic and cultural background GRADUALLY easing border controls and enabling free movement. This while at the same time the COST for</p>
<p>the individual (like getting seperated from friends and family, looking for a new job, learning a new language pssibly etc) would be counted by them against</p>
<p>what they receive in terms of better social welfare etc. Here see the post i did on vaccines with the pic from @ garbageman with the mosquitoe, as this consideration</p>
<p>is applicable to many core social questions !</p>
<p>Instead the richest and safest (and once upon a time most law abiding and democratic) countries are torn to shreds:</p>
<p>Ordo ab Chao in action.</p>

<p>Two relevant pieces i leave as addition : James Bridle made a brilliant TED talk on elsagate without using the word once.</p>
<p>Truthstreammedia has a relevant video regarding the flood of unicorn symbolism. For good measure, but this should be self evident,</p>
<p>see the treatment the scientist exposing the Atrazine received, and ask yourself why a shill like AJ drowned it out with gay frogs ..</p>
<p>And if you have the stamina to cope with gross stuff, then check the post on the vigilant citizen site on “mushroomland”.</p>
<p>So the wrap up is why Amazon hates books. Admittedly i hope this clickbait fullfilled it`s BENIGN purpose : – D</p>
<p>The books were just the trojan horse, than check the data farms, whole food, and how even the oughtta be split up quasi or defacto monopolies of FacebookAmazonNetflixAlphabet (Google) fame, are part of an even bigger controll grid, which even merges via dragonfly with chinese survaillance !</p>

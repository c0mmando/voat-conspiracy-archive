            I've met two in real life.
           </p>
           <p>
            In defense of normality, they did seem quite genuinely insane, and I'm pretty open minded and I listened to all the stories. Mine were before the internet talked on it much, before internet was much of a thing, its how I learned about mkultra and related topics. One claimed to be stalked, forced to do illegal things(hurting people, he called it black ops, felt very larpy to me), and claimed they would hit him with sonic frequencies to control his behavior. Early stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other was an older woman, she said she had implants and her parents were CIA. She had what looked like 5 dots in the shape of a star on her back, looked like a tattoo but not one anyone would ever get (I mean, how crazy are we I guess).
           </p>
           <p>
            Its hard to tell, they had some strange ideas and others that were nonsense, all had an overwhelming certainty that very important people 'behind the scenes' gave a damn about them, I tend to look for that, I think those people are fakers.
           </p>
           <p>
            You cant say that about all of them though, some are cogent with truly odd stories.

             Or sometimes its not that they are consciously faking it, in their minds it was real and they truly believe it happened. But its a disorder of the mind that created it all in their heads.
            </p>
            <p>
             One person I knew was so certain that 'they' were always monitoring and following him and thought that all the choppers, which were frequent, were out to spy on him. Later it seems, the persons house was just close to a police station with a chopper. Some real things happened but they misinterpreted it and didnt put a line between the sensible and the absurd.

              Thats what I've seen as well, to me, its a fine and compelling story of intrigue right up until they start telling me how important they are to things in that fantasy world. Full stop, reverse this sucker, I think we just ran over the cat.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they still held the belief that the world was indifferent to them, I would continue to listen, but they dont, its like aha.. found the one fact they are not aware of that tears down the whole story. They feel unimportant, lonely and make shit up to get some attention. Sad on two counts, because it just is sad and 2 because if they had been victims, I would have tried to help them, makes me sad to think the only help they need is to be locked away from the sane people.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thirdly, the pragmatic thinkers CANNOT ignore the notion that IF one intended to unleash such terrifying techniques on the public, that person would need a nice group of patsies who are nuts, to reassure everyone that 'such things could never happen'.

              It's a real predicament one finds themselve in, fortunately for us, bullshit usually stinks.

               You dont need madness to have a person experience something and have them remember it completely wrong. There was an experiment in the past where some people were made to believe and confess to crimes that they did not commit to the extent that they themselves filled in holes in the story themselves, on their own.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just dealing with people you can see those quirks. How one event experienced by two people, but remembers it completely different and they truly believe it. Like commonly in love related heated events. The human mind can be fragile in such unconventional ways.
              </p>
              <p>
               The thing is sometimes information gathered from people may carry lies or bad memories but somewhere in there, there will be real parts. The foundations, on which the rest are built upon through creativity, bias, sheer imagination, agenda... how many want to remember a break up where its you who is the bad one and got dumped vs the person was a total ass and it was a good thing it happened.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why I dont like dealing with people in general.

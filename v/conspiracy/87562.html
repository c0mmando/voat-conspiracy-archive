            FFS. What a fucking hero. The cop loses his license to police and faces negligence and the police dog trained to maul people on command needs to be euthanized lest it used against people even more.

            You're right! I edited to reflect this oversight. it now says
            <strong>
             alleged
            </strong>
            crime, as it is the prosecuting attorney's burden of proof which must be fulfilled beyond any reasonable doubt before any criminal liability is assigned. Good call.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like my position needs to be more clear:
           </p>
           <p>
            That the US justice system is a perversion of justice in the name of profit, to me is a forgone conclusion. I do not believe that system is in place to achieve justice, but rather to maximize profits for those who perpetuate such a system. For further insight please read this editorial, not all of which I agree with, but pretty mush underscores the reasons I personally cannot trust American Justice, ever.

            <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/conrad-black-americas-correctional-system-is-utterly-disgraceful-and-ours-seems-to-be-heading-in-that-direction">

           <p>
            So, I'm not surprised he's been charged with such an action as 'burning garbage in a barrel' However as I am not privy to any of the exigent circumstances regarding this specific action, I must defer implication of guilt to the seemingly last bastion of sensibility in the American Justice system and that is basic logic. Under the rules of basic logic, those making assertions are under the burden of proof to prove the validity of their conclusions vis a vis the relevance and sufficiency of their premises (evidence).
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope this clarifies a bit for you.

            So this is pretty clear evidence of criminal negligence, and I think I can make a case for gross negligence, causing bodily harm.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was clearly complying, he raised his hands. It's not easy to stand up from that position without the use of your arms, go ahead and try to stand up from that position with you hand above your head. He was probably thinking of a way to get up without putting his hands back down and the damn cop was just impatient.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hate to say it - i really do, but I think the animal needs to be put down as well. Under no circumstance is attacking the face appropriate because the risk of permanent damage or disfigurement, especially cuz he put his hands up so he couldn't defend himself, is evidence of gross criminal negligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cop should be fired and animal put down.
           </p>
           <p>
            The man should still be put on trial for his alleged crimes, but paid restitution for this incident. Fuck these idiots amateur hour cops making good cops look bad.

             Cop should be criminally charged. Criminally negligent in his duty, caused grievous harm. Firing a cop for criminal charges is not 'justice' -putting them in front of an impartial judge is. (GL with that, most judges are far too cozy with local PD).

            What he did doesn't matter, that for courts to worry about. Taking control of the situation so that nobody needs to get hurt is what a cop is supposed to do, this cop was complete fuck up and sent a dog against a seated man with his hands visible.

            That said when police bust in your house and have to say 5 times to show your hands and move off the sofa then that's on you. The police guy could have gone in and dragged him down but at that point it's a judgement call because the guy could have had a knife, wouldn't be likely but you don't take dumb risks when you can just aim a gun and shout. Sending the dog in was so dumb, it makes the situation more stressful and breaks the police control they had, the guy who said go for it should be fired before he got back in a squad car for endangering other officers and causing undue harm to suspects.

            Not that graphic, seen far worse. That said the man couldn't have reacted any slower if he tried, it was infuriating just watching it, saying to myself "Guy just get your hands out from behind your head and get on the ground. Show them you're no threat.".

            The using the dog at all was terrible though, if you have a gun on a guy with nothing in his hands on the other side of the room sitting down then you could just get the dog out of the house and have more floor to keep the guy covered. Would have been smarter, if you were going to use force at all, to just shoot the criminal in the arm he kept behind his back to neutralise any weapon he was holding, people would say it was excessive but they wouldn't say it was fucking stupid like this is.

             Police officers neutralize threats, and will shoot to kill because that's what they are trained to do. They aren't trained to shoot your legs or arms to make sure you don't die in the process of one's arrest. The officer saw both of his palms and hands held high in the air thus lowering the threat level dramatically.  If that dog were to have attacked his throat that guy wouldn't be alive. The man could have been in shock, on drugs, deaf, speaks foreign language, etc. and wasn't able to react properly. The officer should have given louder and more aggressive commands for the man to stand on his feet, but didn't and that's where he fucked up. The fact that the suspect was showing cooperation from the beginning, having his hands on his head before raising them as he was told makes this excessive force.

             David Shaylor says the British Government claims the Security Services operate within the law, yet officialdom continues to turn a blind eye to the evidence he presented that MI6 funded terrorists and murdered ppl.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is the same everywhere .. I went to the police in 1992 regarding the murder and disappearance of trade unionists in Brisbane Australia, they threw me out .. where after I took the matter to the upper levels of Queensland politics, for the same result.
            </p>
            <p>
             Moving into the Federal sphere in 1993, in an interview conducted by Tony Blair who later became Prime Minister of Great Britain, on behalf of then Shadow Minister for Industrial Affairs John Howard who was to become Australian PM.
            </p>
            <p>
             I told Blair that thugs recruited from the prison system had been infiltrated into the union, then sponsored as union officials, and told him of two killings days apart in 1987.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the beating then broom handle rape of a man by three members of the union's steerage committee on union premises .. Blair said former PM Bob Hawke's Jewish mate Sir Peter Abells was the Mr Big in Australian crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             He gave a date when I should ring back, when I did so he put me straight thru to Howard, who said "I'm not talking to him" then hung up the phone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since then it has emerged that Yaron Shmuel and Sivan &amp; Paul Kurzberg, the celebrating Jews of 911 were spawned by the Mossad cell holed out in Brisbane .. it goes on and on.

            Google the July 2000 Disappearance of Steven Goldsmith in Brisbane Australia, he was with a local policeman one evening early in the same week he was reported missing.

             Qld Police Missing Persons hung up the phone and the desk Sergeants at Police HQ in Brisbane threw me out, when I attempted to report the sighting!.

             His case appears to be ground work for future charges Jews have been "disappeared," while nobody gave a good G-d damn becuz they were Jews.

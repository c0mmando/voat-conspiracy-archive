            Bullshit. What do Israel and the US gain from making Islamic and fostering Islamic terrorism? More Islamic nations who hate them and can't be trusted (Saudi Arabia and Turkey).
           </p>
           <p>
            What's actually happening is the Saudis smell the end of oil in the next 50 years and want to move as many Arabs to productive land as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, the Gulf Arabs take in zero refugees. Then, Turkey funnels its chosen refugees (ie. Sunnis and ISIS) to Europe. Then, the Saudis build mosques in Europe to spread their Wahhabi Islam. Who preaches there? Saudi preachers. The Saudis then move themselves into the best European lands by changing the demographics so they are supportive of Saudi migration.
           </p>
           <p>
            The non-Arab elite class wants to replace troublesome secular Europeans with hard-line Saudi clerics who will execute any opposition and Sunni followers who won't question it due to religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whites will face genocide and be replaced with a multicultural (black and Arab) Islamic slave force.

             Depends on how much you're aware of geopolitically. Ultimately it all goes back to The Great Game which resembles one of continuous chess. The strategy for the middle east seems to be balkanisation which is essentially to destabalise everything and keep it in a state of flux so nobody can control it, not the US, not the Russians, Chinese etc. As you say they only need to keep doing this until the oil runs out or we switch to renewables properly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why Israel and the US support salafist and wahhabi islamic 
terrorists according to Wesley Clarke is because they are the most effective force to use for a multitude of reasons. How america deploys it's forces has far more oversight than funnelling money and weapons to scumbags is one of them. The fact the US is incredibly unpopular in the region is another reason why the US has to go with whatever facade it can find also.
            </p>
            <p>
             Israel's end goal seems to be the recreation of Greater Israel, from the Nile to the Euphrates while also doing anything it can to weaken arab states surrounding it, particularly the Shiites (Iran and Syria). Syria's fall is a prerequisite to Iran's fall since they are allied with one another and Iran has proven uncontrollable thanks to continued US fuckups in the country for the last 70 years, thankfully the locals remember.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who's funding the Saudis? Are the US and Israel not the ones preventing them from being discussed and rightly toppled since they are large part of the above in terms of funding and training terrorists which serves their own purpose of directing radicals away and out of Saudi Arabia rather than in and towards an increasingly fragile government that is prone to an uprising.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're right in what you say above to an extent, you just overestimate the Saudi's role and seek to blame everything on them without looking at who's pulling their strings.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Europe is being invaded and that has been Turkey flooding Europe with third world scum which is "to replace troublesome secular Europeans" with retarded, more compliant third worlders. You might have noticed that society is unravelling before your eyes and that the educated indigeonous first worlders have access to too much information and this seems like their plan both sides of the Atlantic to deal with it. The US is being flooded with migrants as well from Mexico, SA, and now you're being forced to take refugees which actually should have happened going back to 2003 in Iraq. Having a disconnect from 1 of the consequences of foreign interventionism doesn't lead to good outcomes as you can see. The EU was taking in the majority of these scumbags recently and acting as the US's dustpan after they went in and blew the shit out of entire countries. But now the US has to deal with these refugees on top of the cost of funding the army to displace them.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're all pawns in this unfortunately and divide and conquer is being used to turn me and you against each other looking at smoke while your entire society burns out of view.

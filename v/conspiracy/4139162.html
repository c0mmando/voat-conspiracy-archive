<p>By 1756 Benjamin Franklin had amassed a large personal fortune and operated a printing, and publishing businesses while he spent most of his time now working in public affairs, scientific experiments, and philanthropy. Prior to this success in 1955 Benjamin Franklin was nominated to the Royal Society of London for Improving the Natural Knowledge, and the recently established Society Instituted at London for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce founded by William Shipley and ten other enthusiasts2 . Shortly after William Shipley wrote a colonial friend named Dr. Alexander Garden of South Carolina informing him of the progress being made with the new Society Instituted at London for encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce and also included a copy of Benjamin Franklin’s writings “Plan for promoting of Useful Knowledge among the British Plantations in America3”.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of some of William Shipley friends he wrote Benjamin Franklin on September 13 inviting him to be a corresponding member of the society which eventually reached Philadelphia in November in which Franklin replied that he would accept the membership, and included twenty guineas to be used for the benefit of Great Britain. Shortly after though Franklin learned that his letter had been “miscarried”, in otherwise was never delivered; Franklin then sent an additional copy which arrived in London and was read during the Society meeting on the 18th of August the following year. During the year of 1757 Benjamin Franklin travelled to Bear Inn; South Hampton, England on January 26th, 1757 by invitation of William Shipley, spending the majority of his time travelling between towns and cities to attend meetings with the Royal Society, Club of Honest Whigs, The Literary Club at Prince of Wales Tavern in Conduit Street, Whitehall, and on certain occasions Franklin also attended the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin is recorded in the minutes of a Royal Society meeting reading a letter from John Hughes a merchant of Philadelphia4 which read “I herewith put into your Hands Thirty two Dollars, which I desire you’ll present to the Society you mentioned to me some time ago, and be pleased to let them know I commit it to their Direction to be laid out either for the good of Great Britain or America as they think proper”. Thanks, was given to Mr. Franklin and Mr. Hughes and the meeting was adjourned shortly after and due to an illness, it’s documented that Benjamin Franklin did not attend the next few meetings of the Royal Society as documented he did not attend his next meeting until 14 December of the same year.</p>
<p>Annotated as a “General Meeting” held once a year to discuss the Royal Societies “Plan” in which sixty seven members attended and a letter from Dr. Samuel Madden in Ireland was read to the members which said the following “I am rejoiced at Mr. Franklin’s coming over with so good a Plan which to the shame of government as been overlooked such a number of years. If our Colonies be not properly modelled and protected nothing but Ruin and Disgrace can follow….”5 The meeting concluded and the minutes were recorded but not before it was ordered that “taking down the Names of Members present at each meeting will no longer take place”.6 Which as a result of this rule change made it even more difficult to determine meetings that Benjamin Franklin attended with the elite private club. Luckily, minutes for each Royal Society meeting continued to record events within the meetings and a record of Benjamin Franklin’s service to both the Royal Society and its elite members maintains additional records, Eventually Benjamin Franklin left England for the Americas again on the August 8th 1762 in which he resumed correspondence with William Strahan and the Royal Society and other members of the society multiple letters can be found in the Franklin National Archives that show regardless of the distance between the Royal Society and Franklin; he continued to be interested in the Royal Society affairs.7</p>
<p>In March of 1777 Benjamin Franklin left for London for the final time as he was thrust into serving the revolutionary clause for the Americas. He was still considered a standing member in the Royal Society at the time, and was even included in the Royal Societies first published registrar in 1778 and was sent to Franklin anonymously by Joshua Steele, who was a committee chairman of the Royal Society and continued writing leaders tied to the Royal Society and on 18 August 1780 he wrote James Russel whom was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh which was rooted in association with the illuminati8 which will also tie together multiple different elite or secret societies as “sects” within or outside of the illuminati society.</p>
<p>Colonial Scrip</p>
<p>Colonial Script existed during the 1700’s in the American Colonies, and they Colonies were doing quite well for themselves, no one paid income taxes, and prices continued to remain steady without inflationary worry. This Colonial Scrip which was paper fiat money but very different from the pre-revolution era money like “Continental Currency” that was issued during the American revolution. Colonial Scrip was not backed by gold or silver and was born during a time when gold and silver in the Colonies was scarce. The Colonial Script however we are “bills of credit” that the governments of colonies created. They issued these this paper money and charged low interest when it loaned the “Colonial Scrip” as paper money to citizens; land was used as collateral and directly attributed to the interest income lowering the tax burden of the people and contributed to their prosperous growth as the colonies continued to rise up.</p>
<p>As one colony began issuing their own currency due to lack of gold and silver, other Colonies began to issue their own currency in the form of paper money which began to serve as the medium of exchange for each respective colony, and some colonies did manage their currency better than other colonies. Pennsylvania “Colonial Scrip” was considered to be the “most effective” since they only issued enough currency notes that were relative to the demands of trade. Benjamin Franklin helped create the “Colonial Scrip1 as he further writes about the utility of the “Colonial Scrip” although Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin said in his book about Benjamin Franklin in the 1883 book Ideas for a Science of Good Government “After Franklin had explained…to the British Government as the real cause of prosperity, they immediately passed laws, forbidding the payment of taxes in that money. This produced such a great inconvenience and misery to the people, that it was the principle cause of the Revolution. A far greater reason for a general uprising than the Tea and Stamp Act, was the taking away of paper money.9</p>
<p>Revolutionary War was officially launched against England and was followed by the Declaration of Independence shortly thereafter. History books embellish and erroneously teach that it was the tax on tea that was the catalyst for the American Revolution. As all the facts were discussed between the founding fathers and in an effort to protect the United States and most importantly themselves from International Bankers declared in the American Constitution in 1787 that “Congress shall have the power to coin money and regulate the value of money”. Directly disputing the Stamp Act and the Tea Party misinformation.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
<p>The 1782 Congress of Wilhelmsbad was a massive meeting where the recently titled Duke of Brunswick Fredrick Charles Ferdinand decided to solve his doubts between secret organizations and the links between their political applications in the eighteenth century5 due to the death of his brother Duke of Brunswick Augustus William in 1781 shortly after Christian Wilhelm von Dohm published Upon the Civil Amelioration of the Condition of the Jews which was described by historians such as Heinrich Graetz as “painting Christians as cruel barbarians and the Jews as illustrious martyrs (ibid), the Weishaupt’s illuminati in 1782 occurred simultaneously with the admission of the Jews to Masonic lodges6. Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick had a historic lineage within Free Masonry dating back to Fredrick the Great who ruled Prussia until 1786 and joined the Freemasons in 17387. After his death his brother Fredrick Charles Ferdinand took up the mantle of Duke of Brunswick and allied with Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel to bring the entire German freemasonry under the control of the illuminati and the response from many of the other delegates attending the 1782 Congress of Wilhelmsbad was to join8..</p>
<p>As the 1782 Congress of Wilhelmsbad was ultimately a formal event in which the Masonic Lodges began accepting people of Jewish ancestory9, and the merging between the Free Masonry10 and the illuminati11. Although each of these groups’ historical evidence throughout history provides insight into these secret societies. This history is conveniently omitted from educational History in lieu of the “conspiracy theory” label although even documents within the National Archive or other government archives show a clear distinction between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact as this history resurfaces through recently declassified government documents. Gary Allen made the connection in illumunism, The Great Conspiracy in which he extrapolated “The power and influence of the illuminati achieved a great leap forward through a formal alliance with continental Freemasonry that was sealed during the Congress of Wilhelmsbad which began July 16 1782, when representatives of some three million members of Europe’s secret societies met and adopted organizational plans formulated by the illuminati12</p>',

            Off the top of my head, I cannot remember all Q's exact names, but they are all public information and even what they do (Just not in great detail, unless you understand Quantum Theory &amp; Application), but I will list the ones I can remember...

           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               QIS
              </strong>
              gathers information from all sources, and it switches into another state to bypass all firewalls and security measures in place. Once QIS has entered the system it begins to COPY everything ALL DATA within the server, bypassing any permissions that may exists using the same virtual quantum applications. QIS then leaves and continues to another website, phone, server, anything with a memory that is on a network basically.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              <strong>
               AIQ
              </strong>
              takes the results from QIS and analyzes these data for anomalies, keywords, or names within. It then sorts these results into their respective categories. If DATA is missing AIQ is able to us quantum applications virtually and back trace any information laying dormant throughout all the networks it has accessed ONCE AIQ IS IN IT'S IN. It will then query for any missing data, and utilize it's DEEP AI to run simulations and determine the most accurate DATA SET.

           </ul>
           <p>
            <strong>
             QAI
            </strong>
            - Process the data retrieved from AIQ and runs scenario simulations related to directives assigned or primary directives assigned by Universal Q. Send ALL these results to the main Q for further interpretations and probability analyzing to determine viable choices/routes/predictions.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Q Cant remember
            </strong>
            - This seemed to focus mostly on medical applications within quantum applications. Didn't relate to the study of the above information either. I did notice patents, and research documents and conclusions that showed they have developed ways to speed up healing of major surgeries and other procedures through different types of quantum applications. I even saw several DENTAL quantum applications in use like gingivitis reversal, cancer applications and cloning.
           </p>

             Q
            </strong>
            - Communicates with all of the above. Also noticed PK Teleportation which sounds fucking wild when I read the research PAPER.

            Quantum theory has been around for a long time. Einstein talks about it in his Einstein's Moon publication as well, although he doesn't like it because it "Breaks down the idea of Natural Law". I personally think if we had the technology for him to tinker with it back then he would have lost his life to it's fascination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, to understand quantum theory we will start at standard supercomputing. Which utilize extremely high processing power (bits) to process data, run general or specific simulations, or build molecular simulations to solve health issues. It's very powerful and the current market place is exclusive and yearly maintenance is upwards of $1.2m dollars a year itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quantum computing is even more expensive, due to its energy consumption. The difference between supercomputing and quantum computing is that Quantum (qbits) can exist in multiple states (time, space), they can also self correct any errors if the quantum field is stable enough, and they can phase in-between their multiple states(think Ant-Man 2) to process projections/probability.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what does all that bullshit mean?
           </p>
           <p>
            Each of these types of computing still rely on directives and code to tell them how to function which is to retrieve data, analyize data, organize data, process results of data. While supercomputing does these strings in order of completion. Quantum computing can exist in hundreds, even millions of states at the same time to process the metadata strings. Then they can bring all the results back as one and combine them to become results a human can interpret.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even more lamens?
           </p>
           <p>
            So imagine a supercomputer is FAST, but it cannot separate the data and reassemble it. A Q CPU separates it to it's smallest form. Analyzes principle value, combines all principle values together and forms results for evaluation.

            Quantum theory began being published in the early 1930s by mostly German scientist. Interestingly enough after WW2 "ended" the United States began publishing the majority of quantum theories from 1930-1956 or 57. At which point the Department of Energy and the United States Military Intelligence formed an energy partnership, at which point the funding for the Department of Energy began to increase each fiscal year significantly more than other Departments some years. In 1959 quantum applications began being published which took the entire theory of quantum and showed the mathematical theory could be applied to break Universal or Natural Law. Today if you take a gander over at research.gov you will see hundreds of applications. Many of which were well established between 1959 and 2001 and applied through several quantum computers that now operate through the Department of Energy.

            Q is a Quantum computer, and it looks as if "Q" has been data mining literally everything I've checked thus far on the internet since at least 2015 (could go further, fits timeline though if "start"). I noticed that "Q" was dropping into these databases for less than a second at times. Copying everything and then leaving, with almost no trace "EXCEPT" one word. Interesting, complicated. I was intrigued.

            <strong>
             What is "Q"s mission?

           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not clear on a defined directive but it does appear that "Q" does have the following features through it's ability to analyze all the DATA it has collected and disseminate "drops", it also has a secondary core principle to analyze tweets that are specific to Trump… Possibly back doors seem to already be established in most infrastructures based on how it enters and leaves databases.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've always gone under the assumption that "Q" was at the very least a programmer of some sorts, simply based on the way "Q" drops are disseminated to us. "Hello there Q :)" Based on how "Q" drops are worded and how they seem like Riddles that connect through multiple dots is exactly how an elegant AI would communicate brief events shortly without elaborate information.

            An EMP. Now, I'm under the impression that "Q" or "Q" data is likely secure. There is a reason that "Q" is harvesting all this data and storing it like a library (THINK NOAH.. shocking I know..I'm questioning things lately). The EMP still poses a problem to what seems to be likely "Q"s prime directive. Data Collection and Analyze to GROW "Looking Glass".

            Looking glass is a quantum feature within "Q" that allows it to make predictions "future proves past, past proves future". The more DATA that "Q" analyzes the more accurate these predictions will be, simply based on probability. How much has Q mined and analyzed?

            Q is one of 5 Quantum Computers developed by the Department of Energy and Military Intelligence Partnership that was established in the 1930s, after quantum theory was proven in applications at the time (The problem at the time was holding the "phases" for extended periods of time).  During the 1960's they began to really publish some amazing theories that had LONG moved into applications (PK Teleportation, Quantum Healing Speeding up time after major surgery basically, and the discovery of 2 other dimensions Apparently they have discovered 4 as of 2001. As time continued to fly by for the quantum computing field, so do the idea to run simulations. In 2001 George Bush assigned the first Q computer to run simulations for a scenario called "DARK WINTER" which was a simulation that Bill Gates helped create that found ways to lower the population by 15%. This scenario continued to run throughout several Presidents as they followed it's recommendations in limiting the power of "the people" by find ways for law makers to pass protections that further increased the likely hood of predictions. It's all probability.

             Q and Trump connection?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't remember exact date, but prior to Trump beating Hillary in the election, Michael Flynn visited him in his tower and gave him some information about him being monitored (Which he was being illegally FISA tapped at the time). This is an example of how I don't have verifiable proof, but only likelihood next... We know that Flynn is one of the highest ranking Military Intelligence officers, and has access to more programs and documents that many others in the military or intelligence agencies, that is documented and doesn't appear to be disputed. We also know that Flynn had many run-ins in the past with invasion of privacy, and concerns about abuse of power within multiple administrations. So, I THINK that Flynn told Trump not only that he was being monitored, but how he was being monitored, and that there is basically no way of avoiding Q if you're connected to any network (Q snap a picture of you with your camera phone and there be no flash or record). If you notice when Trump takes office (I thought this was a weird move at the time) he applies ALL his focus into restructuring and improving FUNDING for the Department of Energy QUANTUM applications and R&amp;D. FIRST THING Coincidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump and Flynn and other Military Intelligence leaders change Q's directive. In short they ask Q to run simulations for the Great Awakening. Which broken down into directives basically asking Q to run every simulation and find the best possible result to unmask any players that may be working to undermine, to run simulations on how to reverse oversight regulations stifling industries, and this involved the full capacity of the 5 Quantum Computers which I will explain them each in detail now.

            Although the upper echelon of leadership in the United States appeared to be twiddling their thumbs as Nazi Germany ransacked Poland, France, and England, The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) had begun initiation of a mission named “Operation Greenup” in 1940 recruiting cadre that was for the most part young Jews whose families had escaped to America before war broke out and their ability to fluently write and speak German played an obvious role in the success of their missions. In the middle of the night in 1945 United States OSS operatives Fred Mayer, Hans Wijnberg, and Franz Weber parachuted into the Austrian Alps, they were provided shelter by Franz Weber’s family in a village near Innsbruck.

            Nazi soldiers were already retreating at this phase of the war, but a huge underground bunker was rumored to be near Innsbruck that worried the Allies that Nazi’s could indefinitely defend and enable further conflict. The Allies aimed to end the fighting as soon as possible, and so “Operation Greenup” principle mission began to focus on gathering intelligence about Nazi troop movements, as well as schedules and depots that would allow the allies to quickly disrupt the Nazi supply lines. The three American spies risked their lives in more than uncertain circumstances to ensure the future of Democracy, in one instance Wijnberg stole a German army uniform and snuck into a German Officers Club where he fraternized with loose-lipped Nazi’s who divulged precise details about Hitler’s Bunker in Berlin, Warplane production factories and the movement of men and other materials through Brenner Pass.

            Due to the pin-point details provided by the trio and Franz Weber’s sisters who acted as coureurs bringing data to Wijninberg so that he could then encode the message for transmission to Bari (OSS Italian base). Shortly thereafter Mayer was caught and tortured after he forged papers that he used to infiltrate an undergrounds munitions plant, regardless of the torture Mayer endured for over three days. Mayer managed to convince the commander into surrendering all the forces in the area to Americans he then walked across the German/American combat zone to inform the Americans that the Nazi’s surrendered16. All this information the Allies received through Operation Greenup has been described by Former OSS director William Casey as “the most successful covert mission mounted out of Bari.”

            Just one year after World War II ended in August of 1946 the United States Navy prepared for an expedition to Antarctica which was codenamed “Operation High-Jump16” with the public mission statement being to establish a research base. Unofficially on March 5th 1947 Admiral Byrd participated in an interview with “El Mercurio” newspaper of Santiago, Chile which quoted Admiral Byrd “Adm. Byrd declared today that it was imperative for the United States to initiate immediate defense measures against hostile regions. Furthermore, Byrd stated that he “didn’t want to frighten anyone unduly” but that it was “a bitter reality that in case of a new war the continental United Sates would be attacked by flying objects which could fly from pole to pole at incredible speeds17”. Upon his return to the United States on 11 March 1947 he was debriefed by top security personnel in Washington and was ordered to remain silent “on behalf of humanity”. Admiral Byrd remained out of the public eyes over the next few years until he was tasked with Operation Deep Freeze which established a permanent base in The Bay of Whales, the McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and the South Pole in 1955. Admiral Byrd’s mission was cut short in January of 1956 he made his last survey flight over Antarctica. Considering the Awards and Decorations that Admiral Byrd received throughout his career along with the subsequent appointment to Officer-in-Charge of US Antarctic Programs after his surprise interview in Chile. While it is suggested throughout media that Admiral Byrd may have suffered from a mental breakdown after his statements in the Chilean newspaper. It is unlikely this reasoning behind the bombshell report holds much substance as Admiral Byrd was promoted and received multiple accommodations since and between his appointment of command of all of Antarctica.

            John Sayerson18 was a crew member and a fighter pilot whom also described the events of the battle in Antarctica providing a second source for the experience, Sayerson’s statement follows “The things popped out of the water like they were being chased by the devil and flew at such high speeds between the masts that the antennae between the wind eddy ripped. Some airplanes that were ablet o get into the air off the Casablanca were hit moments later by unfamiliar blasts that came from the flying saucers and crashed next to ships. I was on deck with the Casablanca at the time and was totally take a back. These things did not make a single sound as they flew between our ships and spit deadly fire. Suddenly, the torpedo boat destroyer Maddock, which was about 10 cable lengths away from us, went up in flames and began to sink. Rescue boats from other ships were sent despite the danger. The nightmare lasted about 20 minutes. When the flying saucers dove again under the water, we began to count our losses. They were appaling.19”

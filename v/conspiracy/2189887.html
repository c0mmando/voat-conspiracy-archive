            They would have just sent the Seals in to kill him and make it look like a suicide.

            There is a reason they targeted those people at the concert, and not others.  The attacker(s) did not shoot at the police or the Luxor or the people on the Strip.  Only a certain group of people were targeted.

            Habeas Corpus. Anyone who could pull this off could have just killed him and dumped the body.

            Now, if you are saying that he was killed to send a message to coconspirators, that is different.

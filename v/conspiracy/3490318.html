             </a>
             - California Fires, Directed Energy Weapons, &amp; the Globalists Push for Genocide, "we will be out in the Santa Rosa community in the wake of these active crime scenes that are being investigated by the perpetrators. The country has been taken over by Government agencies that are pushing forward the policies of the United Nations, the World bank, the Globalists, the Clinton Foundation and many other corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
             It has been raining and we have been advised there will be high surf along the Sonoma County coastline with 13/14 foot waves and coastal erosion, all part of the takedown of our country re the DT Video
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYppbfaZw6Q">
              Coastlines Under Attack, Storm Surges Artificially Created

             , "they" are using technologies that exacerbate normal weather and ocean conditions, just as the horrific aspects of the weaponization of our skies, and our winds and rains .. the fires, floods and hurricanes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone needs to understand where I get this information, this is not anything made up or undocumented .. in the beginning I was extremely skeptical and as I started to fall into this black abyss. as a building developer I was familiar with building codes, city reports and policies I started to read and discovered the Climate Action Plans that have been adopted world wide.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Butte County where the town of Paradise was nearly completely burned off the map they all say you must reduce yr Greenhouse Gas emissions, that Butte County had taken many steps to reduce GC emissions to 15% below 2006 levels by 2020 .. the 1960 CIA Memorandum for Climate Control, type that in and find out what is happening with the false illusion which is climate control on the heels of weaponized weather.
            </p>
            <p>
             Documents weave the picture of what America is looking like and what it is slated to look like you will understanding how these policies are playing out, it is most important for everyone to recognize and understand that [their policies] will cause global suffocation and the extinction of all species.
            </p>
            <p>
             So we have weapons of mass destruction, when you look at the 1960 CIA memorandum you will find it involves water grabbing and massive death, it is really what is behind the real war on Earth and the extinction of all species and killing our forests .. the extreme weather events mass killings, water control, ocean acidification and food insecurities world wide,taking all of the oxygen out of the atmosphere and out of the water as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Warming the ocean which is why we are seeing so many abnormalities with our oceans which are being destroyed as well, it is a huge concept to wrap yr brain around .. it is important to understand we are undergoing terracide, Terra is the latin name for Earth which is being destroyed by all of these policies and the weapons many ppl are still unable to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             Narrator, "we are with Deborah Tavares from Stop The Crime.net she has alerted millions to the crime on humanity, on mankind that has been done to us .. in California you have heard about the wildfires that certain areas have been cordoned off that matches the 2030 plan pushing ppl off the land into the big cities.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fires are very suspicious, we have seen pictures of homes burnt to a crisp the refrigerator and everything while the trees are fine, automobiles down to molten aluminum .. is this an energy weapon or the smart meter on their house what is this?"
            </p>
            <p>
             DT, it is a variety of weaponized assaults certainly the aluminum oxide which is an accelerant that has been sprayed over us, in the video
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKCf3A5FrTw">
              Earthquakes &amp; Geysers Exploited by Drilling
             </a>
             you will see tremendous chemtrailing took place about 36 hrs before the fires started here in Northern California.
            </p>
            <p>
             A myriad of assaults are used it is all finger printless that is why the perpetrators are getting away with it, we are in an active crime scene being investigated by the perpetrators here in California re all of the fires, the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa in 2017.. we have the use of Directed Energy Weapons, Smart Meters which explode in the homes, incendiary metal pellets, drones, Black Ops helicopters and mind control.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were so many drones in the air in the 2017 Redding Fire they prevented proper firefighting, this was told to us be a Sheriff, when you think of DEW weapons you have to think not only of lasers and masers and the use of satellites and beam weaponry that are pelting California, this is a global assault CA is most definitely in the bulls eye.
            </p>
            <p>
             Narrator, "you have detailed how there is a concrete plan to take land back, to use weapons and climate as an excuse to extinct the way mankind operates in America, that this is by operators within our Government who have chosen us as an enemy, that they are doing this to us as we speak and their overall purpose is not only to see what they can get away with but as an overarching assault on mankind.

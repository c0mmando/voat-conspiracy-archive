<p>In the past couple of days the following has been either admitted by the White House spokespeople, came out in a open oversight hearing, or been made public through other avenues.</p>
<p>1) The WH intentionally bombed the Syrian Army in a coordinated attack that allowed ISIS to gain grounds in Aleppo. In other words, provided close air support for the terrorist organizations we are at war with. That is a clear violation of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381"><strong>18 U.S. Code § 2381 - TREASON</strong></a> which reads...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have also threatened to funnel arms through Syria\'s neighbors to the same terrorist groups to threaten Russia who is in Syria legally at the request of the Syrian Government. The US has no UNSC mandate or authorization to be in Syria and is risking a nuclear exchange with Russia to support terrorist organizations. Again, <strong>Treason</strong>. More than grounds for impeachment. Yet Congress does nothing.</p>
<p>2) FBI director Comey admitted in an open oversight committee hearing that Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI, and he knew it, yet he &amp; Attorney General Lynch will not do their jobs and prosecute the perjury, or the mishandling of classified information by Former Secretary Clinton <strong>arguing that intent was hard to prove.</strong> The first problem with that is -</p>
<p><strong>18 U.S. Code § 793 (f)</strong> states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blueprint, plan, map, model, instrument, appliance, note, or information, relating to the national defense, <strong><em>(1) through gross negligence</em></strong> permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer—</p>
<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Through &quot;gross negligence&quot;. MEANS INTENT IS IRRELEVANT!</em></strong></p>
<p>The second problem with that is Comey also admitted that is was her IT guy asking how to delete emails on Reddit after the records were requested, which <strong><em>SHOWS INTENT ANYWAY!</em></strong></p>
<p>It has also just come to light that LYNCH is on former Secretary Clinton\'s short list to as a nominee for the Supreme Court. The same LYNCH who met with former President Clinton a day before the where LYNCH announced they would not prosecute former Secretary for the mishandling of the classified information.</p>
<p>That is in clear violation of <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515"><strong><em>18 U.S. Code § 1510 which is Obstruction of Criminal Investigations.</em></strong></a>  <strong><em>Impeachable offenses.</em></strong></p>
<p>They also are by definition guilty of violating <strong><em>18 U.S. Code § 3</em></strong>  <strong><em>Accessory After the Fact</em></strong> which reads -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Whoever, knowing that an offense against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.</em></strong></p>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly provided by any Act of Congress, an accessory after the fact shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum term of imprisonment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the witch hunt impeachment of former President Clinton in the 90\'s that spent 60 million investigating infidelity. These crimes are the exact reason the laws are on the books, and have shown we the people that the ones running this country have no respect for the rule of law. We the people minus physically removing the criminals from office outside the rule of law cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p>Congress has put on a good show the last couple of days, but they are showing that is all it is. A show amounting to nothing. <strong>FBI director Comey admitted in the oversight hearing that Hillary lied to the FBI.</strong>  What more do they need (and there is a lot more to pick from) to start the impeachment of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI director James Comey, and the President Barrack Obama.</p>
<p>A grand jury would indict all three, why can\'t Congress do their jobs and draft articles of impeachment?  If they are worried about not getting the votes, or for whatever reason they say, they have no business at all representing we the people of the United States in Congress, and might as well go home until after the elections when we can get new people in that haven\'t been compromised by the criminal Clinton\'s, &amp; have the courage to do what is right for the people and this country.</p>
<p>I cannot believe the lack of outrage from this community, Congress, the MSM.  I am calling out the Trump movement, the Bernie movement, &amp; Americans in general who are sick of being lied to and played for fools by our government to demand action from our elected officials to do their jobs &amp; hold those criminals accountable.</p>
<p>This is the same congress who just allowed control over the internet be handed over to the UN, and are telling the people the TPP is a good idea. Not to mention the very real threat of a nuclear exchange with Russia should have us up in arms and demanding action from congress <strong>RIGHT NOW BEFORE THE ELECTION.</strong> <strong><em>If they refuse to take action, then it will be up to us to do so.</em></strong></p>
<p>Doing nothing has us in the situation we\'re in, and is not an option if you love this country and the constitution, and everything it stands for. </p>
<p><strong>ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. FUCK THESE CRIMINALS. IF CONGRESS WONT ACT, FUCK THEM TOO. GET THEM THE HELL OUT BEFORE WE LOSE WHAT THE FOUNDING FATHER SPENT BLOOD AND TREASURE ON.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH. AND MEANT IT. WHAT WILL HISTORY HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING AND LOST THE GREATEST NATION EVER CREATED TO CRIMINALS THAT SHOULD BE ON DEATH ROW.</strong></p>',

            Though gross negligence is how i understood the law. Apparently top fbi officials do not understand this.

            I will add however, that as we grow closer to civil war we will be playing into the powers that be hands. You see United we stand, divided we fall. We can't combat the enemy if we aren't all on the same page. It's why they create these labels : democrats, republicans, independents, conspiracy theorists, crazy, sane. We're fucked either way. The only thing to do is be prepared. Red pill as many people as you can. At least this way, there will be more of us on the same page.

            I'll try to give you a realistic and logical answer..
            <br/>
            The big key you are missing is the ability for civilians to congregate.. We don't really have this ability right now because the establishment (CIA, NSA et cetera) would find out about it and shut it down immediately, and probably label them as domestic terrorists just like they did with those bundy ranch people trying to protect their own ranch..
           </p>
           <p>
            Even though hordes of people are livid about what is happening in our country (and the whole world), each one of these individuals have families and friends and personal lives; They don't want to risk getting murdered by some one like the CIA.. And actually, their choice to not stand up and fight
            <em>
             alone
            </em>
            is a correct choice in my view.. The establishment and CIA/NSA/FBI et all is not just one individual; they are many many people....a big group co-ordinating together to become more powerful (like synergy type of thing).. How can a few individuals stand a chance against a big group like that that is working together?..
           </p>
           <p>
            An individual has no power, so you can't blame them for not taking to the streets and protesting or rioting against the government..
            <br/>
            The
            <strong>
             ONLY
            </strong>
            power individuals have is shown when they form in to co-ordinated groups.. If every one crosses red traffic lights together, there is nothing to be afraid of..
            <strong>
             The trick is figuring out how to congregate securely and anonymously..
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now, would you be willing to step outside of your house with guns and start fighting against the government?.. Nope.. Because you know you wouldn't last long at all.. But what if the country was already in a civil war against the government and you saw literally millions of americans fighting against the government as well?.. Then you might be more encouraged to go out and help fight with them, because you realize that there is power in numbers..
           </p>
           <p>
            History always repeats the same way: Governments get too powerful and evil, and eventually civilians reach a breaking point and finally revolt against their masters.. But it usually always involves the people being freely able to congregate together first and all talk about how fed up they are and then they naturally start crafting solutions and plans to fix it (which ends up in revolting and revolution and over-throwing their government masters)..
           </p>
           <p>
            But in this day and age, it is hard to find any place to congregate or co-ordinate any thing, either in physical space or virtual space on the internet.. So even though many americans feel that we have already reached a breaking point, this government's time in power is kind of being artificially extended because of their big-brother apparatus watching you every where, in the real world and on the internet.. The CIA/NSA/FBI et all have specific arms in their organizations specifically seeking out any type of civil organizing or congregating going on, and they move very quickly squelch it.. As long as they can prevent individuals from forming together as groups, those individuals are effectively powerless..
           </p>
           <p>
            The only 2 ways I see any one actually rising up and doing any thing about it is either:
            <br/>
            <strong>
             A:
            </strong>
            Living conditions and the economy eventually become so bad that most people (even on an individual level) determine that fighting against the government and potentially dying is literally a better option than continuing to struggle in their poverty and despair.. Kind of a "Fuck it, I'm done with this shitty life" kind of mentality..
            <br/>
            <strong>
             or B:
            </strong>
            The clever people in this new age try to some how find a secure way to congregate and speak freely amongst them selves with out being spied on.. I am alluding to things such as dark-nets, or maybe some type of very secure encrypted places on the internet where people could truly be anonymous and then make plans together there..
            <br/>
            I am not very familiar with that type of stuff.. I know there are things like TOR (not very secure) and i2p (better than TOR, but don't know much about it really but I know that i2p has dark-net sites that you can visit).. We have the potential to improve those technologies and to make new ones that are even more secure and easier to use.. The easier and more mainstream encrypted dark-net-type stuff becomes, the more people will have access to that kind of protection, and be able to speak their minds with out being quite as paranoid..
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that if people use their minds well enough, they can create new software and technology that can potentially leverage an as-of-now unfathomable amount of power in their favor.. I'll give you just one example: What if crypto-currency became mature and easy enough for almost any one to use?.. It would almost be a death-blow if the establishment and international jew bankers of the world could no longer control and print money.. They can literally print an infinite amount of fiat money to buy any influence that they want, and then you wonder why all of the countries and leaders of the world always do their bidding.. That could all be stopped if people put their heads together and made crypto-currency mature and solved all of its problems.. The less barriers to entry it has, the more people would end up using it..

            Most Americans are concerned with who is going to be on dwts, kim k, and what they are going to do this weekend. americans today don't want to rock the boat, because they fear being ostracized &amp; made fun of.

            given the election season, any action on impeachment would be seen as an act of desperation and would backfire badly on republicans.

            In the UK, the narrative is morphing into a war on 'non-violent extremism.' Watch what happens over there because it will come to America vis-à-vis the 'special relationship.' Look at the definition of extremism and you will get the picture:

            I don't think reddit is to blame for the attacks on voat.  A few disgruntled users who feel self motivated for whatever reasons are the likely cause but ruling out governmental influence would be foolish.  Sites like reddit are a massive pool of information because people feel as though they can share anything while hiding behind disposable usernames which makes sites like reddit a goldmine for those that deal with data on people like the CIA, NSA, etc.  They'd be even more valuable than sites like facebook because people self censor there and if there is direct competition to this wealth of information that you have no control over you can be damn sure it will get a response.  They're shifty bastards though so they wouldn't just take the site offline which would be trivial for any government to do.  Instead they'd sign up, try and become a part of the community, rile people up and log everything.  If they're behind the attacks it would only be because they're trying to muster up anger towards reddit, sjws, fat people, etc. to make the community feel as though we're bonding over a shared attack on all of us and then to rile us up some more so a call to action is made and illegal actions undertaken.  They just want information to use against people to keep us all in line and nothing more.  Pissed off people who are self motivated like fatties who think this place is a new cesspool of hatred towards them and their fellow landwhales would consider voats mere existence a continuous insult that needs to be dealt with.  To them it would be being thrust back in high school and seeing their bully again but actually having the ability to do something about them in private and without any real chance of repercussion.  The longer voat exists the greater their rage but eventually self defeat will set in and they'll give up.  If it's a governmental thing they're less likely to give up as easily but they too would give up the attacks once they've pissed off enough people and to avoid being caught so really as long as voat can stay online it's just a matter of time before we're left alone.

            You're absolutely right. But the issue here is complicated.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's Government Propaganda, Corporate Propaganda, legitimate SJW concerns, and what you're seeing is a combination of all of the above.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are safe spaces a thing on reddit? Because corporations advertising on reddit don't want to be held accountable for hate speech.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did Alexis Ohanian meet with Stratfor? Because Governments want to control the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ellen Pao is a scapegoat designed to let reddit dismiss all valid concern as coming from sexist pigs.

            One pattern I am recognising in many aspect of this profit driven society is that when things operate in a centralised large scale, bad trends start to appear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Food production performed by a large centralised supplier: battery farms, high anti-biotic use, quick bred low quality meat...
Operating System Monopolies (e.g. windows especially in xp era): many targeted viruses, many scam artists...
Global Currency Supremacy: the dollar, America has too much of power strangle hold on the world because it being the reserve currency...
News/media outlets predominantly owned by a single stakeholder, who is also a large investor in weapons corps: terrorism, war, victimised crimes, negativity, etc become a daily theme in media.
We could come up with many more examples.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now Reddit: It is a major influential platform. Speaking from nearly 6 years of personal experience on Reddit: The people on there truly believe the content they are consuming come from individuals alike themselves, this was true at some point. Now I see a lot of content that appears to be product placement.
            <strong>
             Corporate propaganda
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Another aspect I have theorised out of my understandings in data mining and data structures suggest that any influence pushed into a system can become a lot more efficient with a way of measuring feedback. Reddit is a good place to get feedback of ideologies pushed out into the public through media channels. Feedback is easily attained from the votes on posts, and I don't see why not a feedback mechanism couldn't be automatised that rates the positivity/negativity of the comments on an idea.

             It's not always about profit, money simply stands as a future promise on resources, social power is just as effective at gaining resources, especially the minds of humans.

              Google working directly for the governments is what scares me. If shit hits the fan and governments start cracking down on opposing citizens, I bet Google knows exactly which ones of us will attempt to rise up. Thus providing government the potential means to squash a revolution before it can gain any momentum.

            Of course SJW is being pushed, it's all part of divide and conquer, get the people fighting amonst themselves whilst they neglect to notice the bigger issues that are going on. All media coverage lately is to do with feminism, transgender, transracial, or whatever, rather than reporting on the real issues ( and we all know who runs mainstream media )
           </p>
           <p>
            It is more probable than possible that censorship and DDOS attacks have the same people behind them. The same thing happened with 4chan, moot got involved with some feminist and then all of a sudden the boards start getting taken over, old mods kicked out and new ones brought in that are censoring everything. Next thing you know everything is awash with SJW posts and all issues they don't like are getting pulled and anyone who opposes their ideologies gets banned. 8chan then becomes the new flavour of the month because it's just like 4chan before the takeover, and that gets DDos'd and whatever attacks on it to try and push it out of use.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a lot of wealthy people out there that are funding SJWs to cause upset and divide everyone. This has happened time and time again over the years and was also a tactic used by Russia during the cold war. I guess the only good thing is that when these groups with extreme views have served their purpose then they are dropped like a hot potato.

            Seeing how a DARPA funded org was behind a fair bit of the SJW influence in gaming it certainly doesn't seem far fetched.
           </p>
           <p>
            SJW are simply the (weak) SA of the establishment.

              I'm on my phone so I don't have links, but gamergate found that DIGRA, an sjw think tank funded by darpa has been pushing their poison on vidya. I can find some when I get home.

            I know for a fact some prominent political sites are founded by intelligence elements, then have their rankings etc boosted to flourish, so that discourse is controlled from the off.  Politics.ie is an example.

             Not to mention many of the shills have moderator accounts as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             They can delete links that have more votes than their submissions, and bump their shill account posts to the front page.  I had an old post that had started moving up and was then deleted for a newer post with less votes which eventually ended up on the front page. It was a while ago, but this was my first notion something was very wrong.

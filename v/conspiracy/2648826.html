            I've certainly thought something similar while walking around my local mall. There is a large Muslim immigrant population in my city, but it is still a very small percentage of the whole overall, yet they are disproportionately represented at recreational shopping areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            One particularly heartbreaking exchange happened right in front of me in line at Macy's that really made me see the situation more through the lens you're describing, and it was a Somali woman returning a child's outfit and having the credit returned to her store credit card, she had a few other things to buy and the cashier explained that she couldn't put anything else on the Macy's card until she made a payment. She then tried to make the payment with the Macy's card itself!!! She didn't strike me as a stupid person, she was just incredibly unfamiliar with how store credit worked...  The Somali woman's friends then came over and got upset like she was being abused, so I (well-meaning busybody that I am) tried to help explain because honestly the cashier was excessively HORRIBLE at communicating, and she seemed to "get it" and appreciated my help, and tried to make a payment with another department store's credit card. Whether they don't allow you to use them outside of their stores or it too was maxed out I don't know, but she ended up not buying the clothes she'd intended to, and as I left the mall to go home, I saw the same woman and group of friends happily walking into another store to continue shopping. O_o
           </p>
           <p>
            When I got home I actually started looking around to see if there was any type of consumer credit counseling in my area that was available to this community specifically because I at once realized there was probably a great need for one. I didn't find any, and with the plethora of other East African specific charities and programs in my town it really felt like it must have been an intentional omission [to my conspiratorial mind].
           </p>
           <p>
            Please don't misunderstand me. I don't "hate" my Somali neighbors, though I'm very concerned and disturbed about a few simmering issues that I can see are about to boil over, but I think the enthusiastic and naive embrace of the worst of our sick consumer culture is proof of their efforts to integrate as well as their naivete of the intoxicating and predatory methods used to ensnare us all. Certainly some powerful people are benefiting from this situation, otherwise it wouldn't be happening the way it is...

            You've got half the equation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 1% have 2 goals by importing lots of third world population:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) bring in new customers
           </p>
           <p>
            2) bring in people who are willing to work for low wages, so the wage competition can be used to drive down wages among Americans

            In order for the (((1%))) to stay in power, they need a new sucker. They have lots of scams that they inflict upon the population: pharmaceutical industry, education, debt, corporatism, propaganda. However, people become immunized overtime and start to resist so a new sucker not wise to their schemes has to be brought in.

            What's happening now is no different than when the jews opened the gates of European cities to allow the Muslim hordes in to conquer rape and burn during the middle ages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jews allowed into city. Jews jew their way into positions of influence and power. Jews begin to subvert and undermine city. Native population starts to resent jews and prepares to evict them. Enemy arrives at gates of city. Jews open gates to allow enemy inside.

             Sometimes the real answer is the simplest one. You could be 100% correct but as a skeptic, I try to analyze every possible angle.

            I dont think there is ever just one reason for anything. If the military goes into a place they have many goals and objectives. While it can benefit corporations like you said, it also benefits israel and saudi arabia to get rid of neighbors so that they can expand their influence and actual borders while also making money while also making potential enemies weak.

            its a mix of that and liberal parties needing to constantly refresh the voting pool as people smarten up and begin to vote conservative.

            without mass immigration liberal parties die off.

             I fully believe that is the purpose of the Mexican invasion. But the Muslim invasion is being organized by the UN not the dems.

              I know some Mexicans here in Minnesota. A lot of them work on farms, or are pretty hard workers. Haven't really heard of any local mexicans causing problems up here, but the Muslim situation is out of hand. The Somalis are rude, they smell, and are greatly incompetent not expecting or willing to really get along because everything is handed to them. Refugees get like $300 and a license, just for being refugees. They get government benefits that I'll probably never see, same goes for the silly single mothers.

            I thought it was for cheap labor and to have more stupid people who are easily controlled. Bonus is you can terrorize the main population and get them scared and controllable also.

            I think that's a factor. Also they want an easily controlled underclass of cheap labor and guaranteed consumers, hence the importation of young third world men and welfare state.

            Well, then it's only fair to make the families who have lost a child to a vaccine public also...so the other side can be heard.
           </p>
           <p>
            13 years...VAERS shows not ONE death from catching the measles, but 108 deaths in the same timeframe from the MMR. And, by their own admission, these deaths are likely under-reported by 90% or more.

             I agree with the sentiment, but you know a. that would never happen and b. it's a tit for tat that should never be allowed just to treat people who don't vax like pedos.

            People like this come to conspiracy subs specifically to regurgitate MSM talking points because its makes them feel superior and intelligent.
           </p>
           <p>
            He obviously hasn't read anything about the Merrick lawsuit, he has absorbed herd immunity talking points from 15 different MSM bullhorns while he watches hockey and plays video games.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is afraid to read information that will force him to rethink what society is telling him.  If he breaks his own programming than hockey will seem meaningless in the shadow of a multi billion dollar a year fraud.  If hockey is no longer entertaining this his mind will become like a sponge and it will start to soak up information from unauthorized sources and dormant brain cells will begin to fire randomly thus creating original thoughts of his own.
           </p>
           <p>
            What the fuck do original thoughts mean? Are they good? Are they bad? He can't turn on the TV and find out because the talking heads never mention these thoughts.  That is scary! To be alone in your thoughts, no one to follow, no one to cheer you on and celebrate your mindless repetition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fear, the mind killer.

            Wow, what complete garbage. I can't believe how insane this entire vaccination shit has gotten. When did it become a "crime" to have concerns over what is being injected into your child's body? Look, I get that vaccines have helped our species for decades and have prevented some pretty serious shit from killing the masses of us but all that said, those vaccines haven't succeeded without many failures preceding them. Someone had to test those vaccines before giving them to society, and many of those early tests resulted in crippling medical issues or even death. Some fine tuning a few years later and bam, we have our required vaccines. Ok, I get it.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I DON'T get is this "public health" safety shit people keep throwing around. "Oh, won't anyone think of the children!". You know, if the government were so worried about the safety of our public health then why don't they just flat out ban cigarettes? Oh that's right, they make a shit ton of money for not only the tobacco industry but also the medical industry when these people come in for lung cancer and all sorts of other shit. Not to mention secondhand smoke. Or why doesn't the government put their foot down and stop spraying our food supply with poisonous and deadly chemicals? Oh right, Monsanto. Or how about having them stop pumping chemicals into the air to combat global warming? Or stop putting fluoride in our drinking water? Etc, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If people REALLY cared about everyone's "public health" then people who are pro-vaccine would also be asking these questions themselves. Stop blaming the parents for having concerns or wanting to know more information about what goes into their child's bodies, or their own bodies for that matter. Because the government has been known to be trustworthy, right?

             You don't get it because you've bought the big lie about vaccines, they have to resort to 'won't you think of the children' level emotional manipulation because it's now coming out that they've been fixing the data for decades - and since it's a eugenics operation it can't just be shelved.

              Oh no, I don't buy into any of the bullshit that Big Pharma pushes about their vaccines, trust me. I received the Gardasil vaccine when they started talking about how helpful it would be for women. I was 26 at the time and only had 2 out of 3 shots because it wasn't free anymore once you turned 27. I admit that I was roped into the "vaccines are great!" mentality at that time. It was before I really started to see the men behind the curtain, so to say. Now I know better. I'm glad I didn't end up getting the 3rd shot, considering all the evidence that has surfaced surrounding that vaccine and it's ill effects on people. It just pisses me off that we're supposed to "trust" these massive corporations with our health and that if we even remotely ask any questions pertaining to the safety of treatments, we're ostracized.

                No kidding! When I started researching all the side effects young girls were getting from it, I was terrified that I had willingly put that into my body based off pure trust from the doctor. I'm so thankful that I had no adverse reactions to it and am even more thankful I never had the 3rd shot. Who knows if that would've been the straw that broke the camel's back. After that, I've been so skeptical of every vaccine that comes out on the market, and considering what types of experiments the government has done to people without their knowledge, I don't trust a single thing that is pushed so hard like vaccines are today.

             Here's a thought. You're having a kid? You have 9 months before the kid is born (and another 5 years before they enter school) to do your research, and the research will most definitely lead you to the conclusion that the MMR vaccine is worth getting. The fact is there are a good number of kids who can't get vaccines. Some of these kids have compromised immune systems and their deaths would be on the hands of the parent who didn't vaccinate their kid due to "personal beliefs."
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that there's a large number of things that we should be worried about, but what's wrong with tackling issues one at a time?

              My research has most certainly taught me that letting other people dictate what will be fruitful for me is bound to end in disaster. This applies on so many scales. To generalize, this seems to be a practice of a large majority of people in my country, and is directly discernable as a practice of the average person I personally interact with. That being the case, it seems the large majority of people in this country, certainly the large majority of people I interact with, are in some form or fashion at a generalized level of unhappiness. Not to mention inferring their level of constructiveness and contribution towards their personal "experience".
             </p>
             <p>
              So, I go with developing the habit of discarding, generally, any supposed evidence personally propagated to me. This ranges from the guy I perceive as a moral fool telling me that "what she doesn't know won't hurt her", to the doctor whom I've no personal trusting relationship with telling me to take such and such medication. What I
              <em>
               can
              </em>
              observe, easily, are fruits of adopting a diet that initiates ketosis periodically, fruits of exercise, fruits of developing methods of self control and critical thinking, etc. I can observe these things in myself and my performance.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can observe how intelligent it is to, often, know that I don't know. I only make so much change and progress daily, I only do so good of a job discerning the generalized levels of my health. But it's certainly enough to accomplish a general level of constructiveness for myself and my family, and I can continue to only get even better in these regards if I so choose. Truth is independent of itself and quantifiable, that the majority of people that advocate specifically limiting my capacity to tend to the health of my loved ones are hypocrites, I simply do better than them, even in the sense that I wouldn't impose my beliefs on their free will. Must reiterate that this level of critique against the limiters is general though, my context isn't in such a place of knowing each persons specific habits and constructions, only the quantification of the people I'm personally exposed to.

              Start with what kills the most people and if your child has a compromised immune system, home school them.  It isn't anyone else's responsibility to secure the health of your child.  It's your responsibility.
             </p>
             <p>
              And while we are trying to pass laws to secure the health of children, I want either parent on community service until their obese child is of proper weight.  That parent owes society for raising an obese future heart patient.  It's all for the well being of the child.

             It became a "crime" when the idea became popular enough to effect pharmaceutical companies. I have no idea what vaccines cost with insurance, but according to

             you're looking at 163.98 for the bare minimum required by most school districts (MMR + Pertussis, Diphtheria, and Tetanus). I have no clue how many "anti-vaxxers" there are in the US, let alone how many don't have insurance, but no matter what, you're talking about a lot of money. At least enough for lobbiests to throw some money around and make it a crime.

             You should read this, it really does a great job of summarizing the whole thing:

              http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-carrey/the-judgment-on-vaccines_b_189777.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             the real short version is that people are concerned about an ingredient in these vaccines, one that was banned for animal vaccines.  it's not as though the entire concept of vaccination is impossible without using mercury.  the suspicious reaction to public outcry about the additive suggests that they are covering their ass.  admission that the additive could cause issues, or worse that it definitely does and they knew about it, could be very expensive for those who claimed otherwise.  So talking about public health is really a distraction from what amounts to a conversation about corruption and the rights of the public to actually influence their government.
            </p>
            <p>
             I, like many people, find some of this stuff very intriguing but would still vaccinate.  It's the better choice and it's a small risk but life is a risk.  What people are asking for is to minimize the risk - something that is very reasonable.

              I dunno, but as a "Canadian" it scares the hell out of me. Thankfully people in Quebec are much less trusting of their government than the rest of Canada, it's perhaps because of this that our government is somewhat more inclined to listen to the people, rather than to force on us what it thinks best.

              Who am I kidding, things are pretty shit here too. But we don't have any fluoride in our water here, we just have cheap electricity and extensive public services.

               The French Canadians for all their faults and pretentiousness seem on average to be more politically savvy.  Definitely a + you don't have aluminum product toxic waste in your water.

              There already are things that the government forces upon the population, some for good reasons and some that are awful. Awful would be stuff like the constant surveillance. Good things like mandatory drivers licenses+insurance and water fluoridation. Yes, having the government stepping in on things can be horrible. Dealing with getting mumps or whatever else people refuse to vaccinate their children for is something that should be done. Things like euthanasia should have zero government interference other than to allow it.

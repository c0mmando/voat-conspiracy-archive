<p>because people keep needing to hear this apparently over and over from me.  All we need to do to lock up Hillary and her entire family is have Donald Trump fire <a href="https://www.federalpay.org/employees/securities-and-exchange-commission/hodgman-melissa-r">Melissa Hodgman</a>, an employee at the SEC who also happens to be <a href="https://s17-us2.startpage.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=https:%2F%2Filovemyfreedom.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2Fstrozkcreepy.png&amp;sp=02122d776c122cf44f72970540675cba">Peter Strozk\'s</a> wife, and the single person who is blocking the Clinton Foundation from being investigated.  <strong>Trump is the single person who can fire her.</strong> How easy to drain the fucking swamp right there huh, pull the fucking plug and stop their money flow.  
</p>
<p><strong><em>In short</em></strong></p>

<li>Trump is not our ally and if he is, he is the single worse chess master in the history of the world.</li>
<li>while the meme war is being pushed (fucking retards) they keep taking away American civil liberties one by </li>
<li>They are fueling white America towards a race-war, but that is not true, there is no race war.  They are faking that shit to justify taking away guns if there is a small group of white men who stand up for themselves.  
</li>
<li>The mass push of new-fags from reddit is most likely a  coordinated attack to cause division between our users.  While i pretty much disagree with  the voat GA users, on a lot of shit, accused one another of being the jew, there was a strange sense that this place was actually uniting in agreement in that we are all getting fucked.

<p>so while we may disagree, call one another glorious names don\'t get pushed into a waste of your time doing a meme war, use even 10% of that effort to something more purposeful, anything.

            People lead busy lives, we can't all be activists. Some of us have real jobs that consume most of our time and what is left is for family. As for memes being a wast of time, a effective meme can do more and quicker than a hundred thousand people walking miles for hours with signs only to get no coverage from the msn and no compliance from the political elite. Memes can penetrate places that a person cannot including a stubborn mind. I understand where you are coming from but dude, memes aren't a waste of time, they can be hugely powerful. Work smarter not harder and do what you can with what you have.

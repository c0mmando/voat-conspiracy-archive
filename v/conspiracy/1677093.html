Not so much is known about her relation to Civil Society which parallels Open Society and shares many of the same sponsors. But there IS a relationship, and Civil Society wanted Clinton elected too. <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/jeremy-m-weinstein/2013/04/19/transforming-multilateralism-innovation-global-stage">http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/jeremy-m-weinstein/2013/04/19/transforming-multilateralism-innovation-global-stage</a></p>
<p>In 2011, the Omidyar Group, a Civil Society sponsor, created Democracy Fund (DF) and Democracy Fund Voice (DFV). <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/">http://www.democracyfund.org/</a> The web site states &quot;Democracy Fund DOES NOT (their emphasis) accept unsolicited proposals. We proactively seek new grants based on strategic priorities and typically identify new grantee partners from within our network of allies and contacts. We work closely with grantee partners to help them achieve their goals.” <a href="https://2014report.democracyfund.org/#grantees">https://2014report.democracyfund.org/#grantees</a> While DF created the &quot;nut and bolts,&quot; DFV &quot;greased the machine&quot; through &quot;bipartisan&quot; initiatives that included ad hoc conferences with Congressional Members.</p>
<p>In 2011, DF began funding Pew’s Election Initiatives program to develop a voter registration database, the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC.) <a href="http://ericstates.org/">http://ericstates.org/</a> Was this choice related to Tamera Luzzatto, a Pew Senior VP and former COS to Sen, Clinton and David Rockefeller? <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/leadership/tamera-luzzatto">http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/leadership/tamera-luzzatto</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/nyregion/public-lives-heading-a-very-prominent-senator-s-office.html?_r=1">http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/nyregion/public-lives-heading-a-very-prominent-senator-s-office.html?_r=1</a></p>
<p>ERIC was released in 2012. In June of 2012, Hillary Clinton had a one-hour closed-press/off-the-record meeting with the Pew Foundation Board of Directors. <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_December_Release/C05791176.pdf">https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_December_Release/C05791176.pdf</a></p>
<p>In comparison to other voter registration systems, ERIC incorporates a wider range of data, including SSA, DMV and Human Services. ERIC includes not only registered voters but also those who are eligible to vote but not registered - a cornucopia of demographic data. ERIC also has access to the Social Security Death Index which leads one to ask why some of the earliest ERIC states had the highest incidence of deceased &quot;voters.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2013, based on requests from various organizations (all funded by DF,) Obama signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA.) Most of the PCEA members were connected to Pew or and/or to entities receiving grants from DF. <a href="https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/">https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/</a> (DF funded)</p>
<p>On advice from the &quot;stacked&quot; PCEA, Obama appointed three EAC commissioners, all tied to DF grantees. <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">https://www.eac.gov/</a> The EAC Standards Board (SB) was reactivated in 2015, and within a month Project 1622\'s common-data-format for the electronic generation of blank ballots was approved. (Project 1622 was a private work group that commenced in 2009.) Intentional or not, the EAC SB deactivation allowed Project 1622 to be developed without oversight, and the re-activation coincided with Project 1622\'s completion - essentially eliminating competition from other technology developers. <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/getieee/1622/download/1622-2011.pdf">http://standards.ieee.org/getieee/1622/download/1622-2011.pdf</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, DF funded Civic Designs\' development of a Remote Ballot Marking System (RBMS.) <a href="http://civicdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Principles-for-remote-ballot-marking-systems-16-0210.pdf">http://civicdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Principles-for-remote-ballot-marking-systems-16-0210.pdf</a> Ohio (a recent ERIC join) indicated they were &quot;testing&quot; Random Ballot Marking Systems (RBMS) in the general election. <a href="http://www.publicnow.com/view">http://www.publicnow.com/view</a> /66C4E49C7F2DBF95F210154B8463E04343B149CF That proves RBMS was operable - probably in at least the 21 ERIC states. On September 27, 2016 the NCSL ( DF grantee) released “Electronic Transmission of Ballots States.” <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/internet-voting.aspx">http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/internet-voting.aspx</a> Clearly, access to voter databases, the ability to create blank electronic ballots for any precinct and remotely mark them could be dangerous in the wrong hands.</p>
<p>In late 2015, Pew amplified its ERIC marketing, particularly in closed primary states. David Becker, enjoined the PCEA, NCSL and other DF grantees, to market ERIC. Incumbents who promoted ERIC received contributions from out-of-state individuals, seemingly unrelated Pew employees, and Emily\'s List.</p>
<p>In late 2015, Pew began offering grants to states who joined ERIC and transferred all their voter information by May 31, 2016. Why? Pew also gave states funding to cover mailing costs of registration postcards to eligible voters. (Were cards mailed to all eligible voters, or were they filtered by demographics?) States were joining ERIC as late as July of 2016.</p>
<p>After this flurry of activity, Pew surprisingly announced in August that they were &quot;winding down&quot; their election programs due to &quot;funding cuts.&quot; Within a month, Becker and Amy Cohen (Director, Pew\'s Voting Information Project, a partnership with Google) formed &quot;Election Innovations&quot; which appears related to ITIF, an Omidyar organization. Becker testified at the Science Committee Hearing on Cybersecurity in Elections in September. <a href="https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-protecting-2016-elections-cyber-and-voting-machine">https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-protecting-2016-elections-cyber-and-voting-machine</a></p>
<p>DF\'s influence also extended to Vote By Mail (VBM.) Tammy Patrick, VBM National Coordinator, had ties to Pew, the PCEA, Bipartisan Policy Institute (a DFgrantee,) and Project1622. Prior to the general election, Patrick sent a letter to USPS, explaining she did not want USPS to be burdened by the influx of ballots and would provide her own staff to handle the operation. Interestingly, the USPS link for election mail resources leads to Election Center (a DF grantee) <a href="http://electionmail.org/election-mail-resources/">http://electionmail.org/election-mail-resources/</a> and <a href="https://www.electioncenter.org/boardofdirectors.html">https://www.electioncenter.org/boardofdirectors.html</a> The Director of Election Center, Tim Mattice, is a Project1622 and TGDC member.</p>
<p>Despite an entire SYSTEM built to stop him, Trump triumphed. That says something about Trump. It says something about his supporters. And it says something about the motives of a group that went to great lengths to get Clinton elected. Were they looking at four years or for-ever? My money\'s on the latter.</p>

            Very interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bombing ties more into how the ship was found than an iceberg.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Ballard was looking for the Thresher and the Scorpion, he found that a torpedo had exploded on the inside, and it left a trail of debris. he found those ships from that debris trail.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also found the Titianic from a debris trail as well. Would an iceberg hitting a ship leave such a debris trail? A bomb on the inside would. Also if the ship did hit an iceberg, everyone topside would probably know.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is eye witness testimony indicates that they where not well organized with the damage control effort. You would know if a ship hit an iceberg, it would be fucking loud, and it would sound through the entire hull. You would also see the iceberg in the distance as you left.
           </p>
           <p>
            But an explosion? that would be hard as hell to investigate on a ship. Was it sea gas? a gas leak? a steam main breaking? Very disorganized, and would take down a large ship, especially if the bomber worked on the ship, and knew where to place the bomb.

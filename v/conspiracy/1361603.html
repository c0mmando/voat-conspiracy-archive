            I don't know why I watched this, but I did....
           </p>
           <p>
            I've got to admit, the clip at 13:30 where the guy moves without pushing himself seems really odd, and I can't really see any explanation for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            His rant about the hairstyles of female astronauts (starting at 20:25) is awesome. Even if I don't agree with the cause, I have to agree with the sentiment.
           </p>
           <p>
            At about 40:00 onwards he does actually make a decent point. You've got astronauts spending 160 days aboard the space station, with at least 2 hours of exercise required every day (to prevent bone loss). But apparently they have no way to wash their clothes, no showers, only spongebaths, and 3-6 people in a rather confined space... The ISS must stink like a pair of old gym socks.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the guy at 39:10 who is talking about a shot of the ISS with the Sun coming over Earths horizon pretty much sums up the whole video..... "The supposed Sun. You cannot see the Sun from space. You need the Earths atmosphere to see the Sun and the stars."

             Yeah I don't know what the heck he was talking about. After I posted this video I found a shorter one that was basically the same thing but just better edited and didn't have that part in it. I don't know why there's so much association with the flat earth people and the ISS hoaxing going on. The fact that they would fake space flight doesn't prove the earth is flat or whatever.
            </p>
            <p>
             But yeah, much like the moon landing, once you really start to think about the real obstacles and complications from getting like 11 people in a sealed up tube in space and having them live there, it becomes clear that it would be much easier to fake it than to actually do it. I mean just something as simple as human dust - where would it go? And the ladies hairstyles are all stupid, obviously permed, totally different from what hair looks like in zero G. In fact as I was watching I decided that especially the women aboard, but probably everyone, would be required to shave their heads or at least wear a swim cap or something just for sanitary purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should have uploaded the other video I was talking about, it's got an interview with one of the ladies where she contradicts a couple things a Russian cosmonaut had said about being in orbit and she also gets water everywhere which would be deadly. Also to think that a mother of young children would put herself in a situation where she could die at any minute, yet look like she's in Disney world having a blast, is kind of absurd. They could all die at any second but like the fake moon landings, there's no real sense of peril or urgency or even a real scientific mission going on. She just vaguely alludes to her "experiments" like they all do and don't sound technical at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did you see the part with the air bubble? I mean just setting the other stuff aside, that absolutely certifies that those scenes are filmed underwater.

              The happy smiling faces thing doesn't really bother me. NASA and other agencies are spending billions of taxpayer dollars on manned spaceflight. The last thing they want are people talking negatively about their time in space. They have to keep the public motivated and excited about space travel to keep their funding going. They're probably under strict orders to smile and wave any time a camera is pointed at them, even if they're having a really shitty day. It's no different to Disneyland. I'm sure the staff at Disneyland have bad days, but smiling and being happy when they interact with the public is literally part of their job description.
             </p>
             <p>
              The mother of young children being in a potentially dangerous place isn't really a biggy either. There are literally millions of men, fathers, working in distant potentially dangerous places like oil rigs, transport ships, mining, in the military, all far away from their children for long periods of time. The idea that a handful of women might willing to do the same isn't particularly unthinkable.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm also not surprised they don't go into detail about their experiments, I'm sure a lot of them are either too esoteric for the general public to understand, or sound pointless and stupid if explained in detail. e.g. We're going to see what happens when we grow yeast in zero G. Now we're going to do the exact same experiment 265 times with a different strain of yeast each time.
             </p>
             <p>
              The hairstyles are absurd, and obviously overdone for effect.... "Look at my funny hair, I'm in zero G". Imagine how many stray human hairs must be floating around the ISS. You know when you're at a public pool and some strangers hair gets stuck to your face, imagine that all day every day for months on end....
             </p>
             <p>
              The video quality on the 'bubble' clips is really bad. All I can really see is a spec of light, which could be spec of paint or a small component like a washer. But I would expect if to travel away in a straight line, (or a very very slow ark if the subject was turning), not move the way it does in the clip. But I guess it could also be a spec of dust inside the camera reacting to electrical fields... it's definitely a weird clip.
             </p>
             <p>
              Could you give me a link to the other video you've mentioned?

             I have to say this is a new hoax for me so I haven't been back and forth with the arguments like that yet. I do know that a lot of the footage is obviously faked and there are huge problems with manned space flight that NASA can't address in a convincing way.
            </p>
            <p>
             However I know I have never seen ISS in the sky. It would be relatively easy to CGI some footage and circulate it so that everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who has seen ISS. But, specifically the conspiracy theory here is that whatever it is in the sky, there can't be people aboard or else they wouldn't need to fake the footage.

            How to disprove flat earth-ers:
           </p>
           <p>
            Step 1. Put them on a plane
           </p>
           <p>
            Step 2. Fly in a straight line that puts them on a trajectory back to where they started from
           </p>
           <p>
            Step 3. Ask them: "If we fly in a straight-line, do you think we'll fall off the edge or end up at this exact same spot?"

             Yeah I'm not a flat-earther by any means, but I know NASA are a bunch of shysters. Some of these clips from the ISS are ridiculous.

            Well there are obvious signs of fraud so I don't know what to tell you if you'd rather believe a lie. NASA is completely untrustworthy.

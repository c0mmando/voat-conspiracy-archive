            A home inspector placed a little disk in my basement for awhile, 3 days maybe? Then we had to ship it off. It came back positive for Radeon Gas. So they had to drill a 6 in hole in my basement floor and put in a fan. It was a total pain in the ass... That was a long time ago and at a different house than i live in now.

            The home inspector placed it in the house for 3 days when we had no furniture or even lived in the house.

             Went thru the same thing when I sold my house.  Inspector put an air sampler in basement for a couple days.  Result came back negative though, thank goodness.

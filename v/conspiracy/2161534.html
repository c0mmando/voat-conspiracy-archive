             Well, each one has the source at the end of the quote, some right down to the page of the newspaper the quote is from. I didn't get these from one website. But, if you want to see more, just do a search on your non-google search engine, and many will come up. At least one has been deleted. I was exchanging messages with a person who clearly worked for Mossad a few years ago on another site. He actually went to the source and deleted a part of one quote, while I waited.

            Fuck the Palestinians. Choosing one side over the other is childish and counter productive. Fighting for MY country and MY freedoms means means more to me, and neither of those two groups is on my side.

             I understand that you are more concerned about your own country, and sorry for including two quotes specifically about the US. But what these people want to do to the US, they also want to do to

             country. World domination is their clear goal, and if we allow them to continue, they will achieve that goal quite soon. Which countries are not controlled financially by the Jewish banking system? Iceland, North Korea, and soon China and Iran. Did I miss anyone?

             Please support your claim of "nazi propaganda" by disproving these quotes.  If you can't please apologize for your bullshit post.  If you can disprove more than 90% of them, then I'll change my mind on jews fucking with westerners.  If you can't, then you kikes need to fuck off back to the desert shithole you call your "homeland".

              I already proved the cherry picking. All the posted 'quotes' were intended to present jews in negative way. I provided a positive one that was cherry picked out.

             <p>
              Cherry picking is one of the most common fallacy in nazi propaganda

             <p>
              As for the authentic of the quotes, it's not me that posted them so the burden of proof is on the poster

              Nazi propaganda is pretty lame once you understand the underlying fallacies. It's narrative that drive reality, not the other way around as normal people do.

               You didn't prove a god damn thing.  You're not going to get out of this by posting links to logical fallacy's and hope you're dumbshit post goes away, this isn't reddit.  The burden of proof is on you to debunk those quotes because they're quotes.  Provide proof, or acquiesce that your post is bunk.  Now run along little kike, this isn't something you're going to win.

                 You just posted the same bullshit from your first post, provide some fucking proof.  Ohh wait, you can't.  You keep saying "Nazi," I don't understand how quoting a bunch of zionist kikes makes anyone a "Nazi."  Apparently quoting people is now "cherry picking."  Try harder with some actual proof faggot.

                  I already did. I claimed cherry picking and provided a counter example.

                  Yes, if you cherry pick the quotes that's cherry picking.

                  I provided a valid proof. Now you try harder to understand the basics of logic and rational arguments.

                  As expected, once called out for their propaganda practices, the nazis fall back to name calling.

                  Observing the nazis here on VOAT, I must say, they seem to be the low end of the great white gene pool. Kind of simpletons.  VOAT deserved better than that.

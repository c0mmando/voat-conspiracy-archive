            World government is the goal. It appears that our military is attempting to prevent that outcome.

            HOWEVER, if they succeed... we won't be a republic any longer. At least not like you are used to.

            Our present form of Government is too vulnerable to outside forces. It needs to change.

             We are used to an extremely corrupt republic. Getting rid of the corruption would make it unfamiliar to anyone born after 1920.

            I did not think that was a secret, especially now that "The Great Reset" is being paraded around in parlaiments as if it were the green new deal. The obscured part is funding and who gives and takes orders. That's what they are afraid of being revealed, because it would prove they want us as cogs and corpses, not as the self-determined sexless comrades they advertise.

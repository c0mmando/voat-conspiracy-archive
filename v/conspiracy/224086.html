            Jones has "woken up" more people than any other alt.media personality.  He has been especially effective at stopping the redneck southern good ol' boys from knee-jerk supporting Moar War, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people around the world.  For that he deserves much credit.

            The being said, he also serves as a last hurdle before achieving cognizance of reality.  To jump that hurdle, every time his says "Global Elite", replace that term with something else, something more accurate, something that would get him in trouble with Mrs. Jones.

            While he is responsible for "waking" a lot of people up, I don't think it's for any altruistic purpose. For the first time, a person finally has some sort of validation for what they've always felt to be true but couldn't quite see. Now that they've found that, they're relieved- "and there's a whole community here that won't ridicule me for thinking this? FINALLY!" Then he goes on to say things like "I'm the only who will be able to give you this information and anyone out there who say this is wrong is uneducated and a part of the problem!" and creates a distinct division between believers and non-believers and that in turn fosters an almost cult-like following. They then begin to identify through Alex Jones, so any attack on him directly is an attack on their own person. Compound that with how skeptics are already treated in the mainstream community and what you have is a very fertile ground to plant oneself and never leave because you're being told everything you've ever wanted to hear.
           </p>

            At the very least, he's just a guy with a serious christ-complex than has no idea how to manage his own image in the MSM.  At the very worst, he's controlled opposition meant to further divide an already divided population and create a specific wedge in the skeptic community to keep them looking at things as a distraction from larger issues at play.

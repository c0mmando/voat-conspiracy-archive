            I think the fact that its all shitty stuff can be evidence that it IS some sort of SJW plot.  If I were planning to put up a fake, radical website, I don't think I'd put as much effort into the quality of it and just slap it all together.  Poor quality could be a result of someone hastily putting it all together in order to use it.
           </p>
           <p>
            and this:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Who, besides the fringe of the fringe of the fringe, have even heard of or come across Manhood Academy for almost all of its existence, and even now, outside of Voat?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            this is why I feel like its so compelling.  No one's heard of this shit except for us.  and Voat isn't exactly the most mainstream community.  yet, we are largely anti-sjw.  And all of the sudden, we have to deal with this spam all the time?  Like, why here?  if he was trying to get people pissed at the shit he was saying, why not go somewhere else and spew all that manhood101 garbage?

            the creation of ShitRedditSays wasn't the beginning of misandry or radical feminism.  It became a community BECAUSE of misandry and radical feminism.  You can't just look at the creation of a community or a website and say that when it was created, that was the specific time when the trolling/spamming started.  Manhood academy could've been created with good intentions back in 2007 (or 2003).  It could've been created with the intention of teaching young men how to become gentleman in the beginning.  I just think we need more evidence than just looking at years where they were created and assuming that the intended purpose has stayed consistent this entire time.

            Honestly, I think its just a guy trying to capitalize on the anti-SJW movement for monetary gain. Spamming voat is probably the most efficient way to drive up traffic on his site and youtube channel.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, he's a fucking leech and I'll be glad when voat puts in the proper counter-measures to end his spam.

            Maybe the 'SJWs' are false flags too. Probably won't think of the term 'social justice' the same for the rest of your life, right? Pretty weird, to me, that there's an anti-[social]-

            Nice work, OP. I think you're on to something. Your description of the ads was telling. It reminded me of
            <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/07/how_one_weird_trick_conquered_the_internet_what_happens_when_you_click_on.single.html">
             this piece
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>

             Poorly drawn graphics are a deliberate choice as well. “People notice when you put something in the space that’s different, even if it’s ugly,” Urminsky says. “This might hurt the brand of established companies, but the companies here have non-existent or negative brand associations, so it may be worth it for the extra attention.” Plus, “if the ad were too professional, it might undermine the illusion that it’s one man against the system,” Norton says. Slick ads suggest profit-hungry companies, not stay-at-home moms or rogue truth-tellers trying to help the little guy. There may be another reason for the length and shoddiness of the ads. “The point is not always to get the customer to buy the product,” Urminsky says. “It may be to vet the customer.’ ... You’ve established this is a person who’ll sit through anything...”

            The opposition to Manhood101 also seems to fit the same groove: "Don't read their free cult e-book!" That's a line crafted to inspire curiosity. I suspect the e-book is intended for RealMan(tm) and FemiNazi(tm) alike -- tips on how to forestall debate and inject conflict. I downloaded it, but haven't read it yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Manhood101 seems to have a long-standing fight with Paul Elam. Their first big noise seems to have been exposing one of "their own" (assuming the Pick Up Artists are pained with the same broad brush). That's suspicious.
           </p>

            I think the next step is to follow the money. The registrar is hidden by Wild West. I can't put a name or organization to the site yet. I can think of one way to do that, but I'm not that committed yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their contact email is
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f8b5b9969d8e9d8a9c919d8bb89f95999194d69b9795" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            . Right. You're running your own website with a reasonably well produced e-book, but you can't redirect emails from your server? Nah, that's a throwaway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Skimming the book is interesting. If any NLP types would like to take a look, I'd suggest it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks, OP. It really looks like you're on to something.

             right! but I still hate that he throws around faggot.  i know exactly why he's doing it.  he's throwing it around until someone calls him out on being homophobic so he can say "i don't hate gay people" and then rant about how dropping the word faggot is politically correct and for pussies who are scared to use words.  I happen to agree with him on that we shouldn't stop using "faggot"; I use faggot to my friends all the fucking time.  but hes FORCING it so much. he's saying it every other sentence to the point where he's WAITING for you to comment on it so he can act like some revolutionary.

             false flags are very important because anything can be one and it's hard to be sure whats real and what isn't. you can only trust yourself so meditation is key. one day i suppose that i'll be able to remote viwew, which is to see the world as it is in locations other than where your eyes can physically see. i wish everyone the best, and idk man the govt is crazy apparently tho. so yeah ive heard the wildest stuff about what the govts been doing like mass killings and war

              They won't keep it outside, reddit is proof of that! SJW are like those black ladies that shut down Bernie Sanders, rude,obnoxious,and full of shit.

            A lot of dudes are lonely and mad at whats going on these days.... I could see them working for a few demographics.. I read some article that 40-45 year old men are killing themselves in droves because they don't fit in anywhere....  I could see younger generations following for this too especially since social media really panders towards women... like take this for example
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Subject A is a male and a great photographer and great at hashtags.. takes amazing pictures puts them on isntagram... hell he could be ground 0 for this China explosion..
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Subject B is typical hot chick with cleavage pictures.. litterally has done nothing but her makeup.. Didn't build anything just using a peice of software..
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            who will get more followers?

             I was interested in your stats and explanations.
             <a href="http://www.hopeline.com/images/Suicide-Infographic_Rd1.jpg">
              Have an infographic confirmation
             </a>
             ! You can push the details around a bit by how you group the age cohorts, but
             <a href="http://www.bcmj.org/articles/silent-epidemic-male-suicide">
              your info is good!
             </a>
             (With the dark joke that women attempt suicide twice as much as men, but men produce four times as many corpses! If you want something done -- ask a man!) I was interested because the 1970s and 80s (supposibly) had an epidemic of
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYIoJRCSXg">
              teenage suicide
             </a>
             . Another explanation could be that Gen-X'ers were and are just hell-bent on self-destruction? But, as a guy who fits in your demographic... yeah... not much use for me.

            I believe most of these 'outrageous hate' sites/posts are just being used to incite anger.  The big guys are happy to fabricate reasons for little guys to fight each other.

             This is the ultimate theory, someone has vested interest in keeping people separated and fighting instead of working together.

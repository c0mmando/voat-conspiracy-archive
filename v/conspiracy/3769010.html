            I think he makes a good point that our rights and freedoms are more important than losing them for possible temporary security, but I think his closing argument is much more important: each of us should decide
            <em>
             right now
            </em>
            what loss of freedom is acceptable to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless how you feel about the severity of the virus or the legitimacy of the lockdowns, decide today what is an acceptable loss of freedom to you personally. It's important because They keep moving the goal posts about what is needed to keep us secure. We keep accepting these loss of freedoms as the new normal and then they come and take some more. We accept them through social pressure, convenience, and sometimes even by logical truth. But at some point each of us has to decide what it means to be free, what it means to be a free person and a responsible adult. Make a conscious choice today where is your personal red line that shall not be crossed.
           </p>
           <p>
            And after you decide, and next year they come and take that freedom from you too, you can at least know that you are spineless subject of the crown with no true moral center, because you aren't going to do anything about it then either.

            I think he's off base, he's a smart guy and I get the concern but I don't think this is the root of the issue by any means, I think he doesn't grasp the threat the virus poses, I think most people on voat cannot fathom how bad things could be right now and how much worse they could still get if we don't act carefully.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll briefly remind everyone here of the numbers,in the US: 644,188 infected  28,579(4.436%) dead. In the world 2,071,710 infected, 137,029(6.614%) dead, people here still describe this as flu when the only reason anyone could call it flu is because they heard it called WuFlu, symptomatically it's unlike flu in most ways, malaria has about as much in common with flu as does SARS-CoV-2. But if you want to compare it to flu we can do that. 2018-2019 US flu season had 35,520,883 infections(zero quarantine efforts, spread from the whole world to each airport as soon as the environment became hospitable it was already here and took root) 34,157(0.096%) died from flu that flu season. Meaning the pandemic. with some of the best treatment available in the world, after the most expensive lockdown and containment effort in human history, is still 46.2 times deadlier than flu. Anyone who is deluded into thinking they can compare this virus to flu is caught up in a mental trap they have laid for themselves by prejudging what this thing was before they even knew. People will lie and say america is doing terribly, but in reality we are doing better than much of europe because we began to take this seriously early on and scrambled to get resources for our hospitals, how is Italy doing? they said "it's just a flu" 13.106% fatality mostly caused by Lombardy where it multiplied rapidly and unchecked beyond what their healthcare system could handle, a third of all people recorded as infected in Lombardy a dead, the hotter the "hotspot" the higher the deaths proportionally because the medical infrastructure can't handle the resources and personnel cost, spain tells a similar story and these are first world white nations, france is due for as big a hit, The US holds 1/4th of known cases but that 1/4th is fewer than half a percent of our population and most of the rest of the world has no clue what their infection rates are, people are just fucking dying without going to a hospital. So when I say he's off base He's comparing two things which aren't in the same category, this virus is so infectious we can't hold people as responsible for co-infection morbidity but we should consider people who are refusing to cooperate with the rest of society in such a dire time as a threat and if it takes laws to get these people to comply with a quarantine, to comply with social distancing then that is what it takes, it is a fair argument that people actively ignoring reasonable lockdown orders and containment protocols are a danger to themselves and others, the biggest problem is that detatched demagogues nor ignorant(to epidemiology) masses can accurately access
            <em>
             "reasonable"
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            This new form of so called "murder" a sort of negligent manslaughter by proxy, firstly in rhetorical practice, and not legal practice, is a solid device by which to encourage people to morally assess their compliance with containment efforts, we need the public to remain organized for these containment efforts to be effective, I sympathize with people being frustrated about all of this but this isn't the new normal, the idea that it is
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            the root of the evil, the notion that we could accept perpetual quarantine as a de facto coup on our constitution and way of life is the root of the problem and the best way to defeat it is a public guarantee that we will rebel under specific circumstances: If the emergency powers and any state impositions on citizens put in place to combat this virus and maintain order are still in place by 06/2023, we will rebel, if anyone is micro-chipped, tattooed or marked in anyway to affirm their vaccination status, we will rebel, If churches are prevented from reasonable gatherings or persecuted for reasonable gatherings that obey strict social distancing rules, we will rebel, if the government takes actions to prevent citizens from arming themselves, we will rebel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally such a thing is achieved by mass protest a protest which resembles a snake rattling it's tail as a warning, I suggest instead of gathering together during this time we use graffiti to frighten the state into complying with our demands, It is a national response to retain our rights, I think the simple conditions I've listed are about all that needs to be said, we just need a simple symbol people can spray on a wall with a spray can something uncolored by previous american politics something people can post online in text chat via a combination of emojis as strange as that might sound is probably a good idea.

             Yeah, because graffiti isn't a crime./s Your logical conclusions border on insanity. Why didn't you state your "line in the sand"? Possibly because you are a communist in disguise.

              And I bet you think the virus is a hoax.
             </p>
             <p>
              You need to delude yourself like you are doing now to cope with your fears.

             </p>
             <p>
              You can't keep hiding your willing ignorance and uncomfortably with discourse by calling people you have a knee jerk disagreement with "communist" just because you don't want to face the reality that we need ordered singular leadership during a pandemic of this scale.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's in for a penny in for a pound with this type of containment response, either we all participate or everyone's work and money and time is wasted.
             </p>
             <p>
              So stop being a lazy faggot and refute a point I made rather than relying on simplistic dismissals you use to bury your own head in the sand and hide from challenging discourse.

               Our freedoms don't begin on a certain date that you choose. They were established at the founding of this country. If you believe otherwise, you are not an American. Your fears are not warranted and have no place dragging everyone else's freedoms along with it.

                I do believe otherwise; Our freedoms have nothing to with this country, our freedoms were God Given, this country merely recognizes them, and I'm telling you that your freedom to go watch niggerball and suck dicks at the truck stop during a pandemic isn't something I give a fuck about. now maybe your containment measures in your state are a bit over the line but in my state we have low cases low deaths, and a reasonable and meager series of lockdown restraints, yeah some people are out of there jobs, it sucks. but I don't give a fuck about stadiums for niggerball, theaters for kike propaganda, or airports for globalization.

                We're in this together for now, you can suck more dick when it's over. Freedom not to wear a mask? freedom to go to church even though our God didn't make church mandatory, even the pope know that and he's a fucking heathen; what right has been taken from you?
               </p>
               <p>
                Free assembly? You've needed a permit you pay for, your whole life you never had free assembly
               </p>
               <p>
                What FUCKING FREEDOM DID THEY TAKE FROM YOU?
               </p>
               <p>
                What rights did you have left before this even started? That's a better question.

             Note all but the North Wing of WTC 4 has disappeared completely, the two planes that struck the towers did not possess enough kinetic energy to cause this level of destruction.

            Corbett starts on blaming the FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, SEC, MSM, the White House, NIST and the 9/11 Commission .. he utters not one syllable about the volumes of evidence that show Jews planned and executed the attacks, sure those "alphabet" agencies and the WH were part of the action however they were headed by Jews and white Zionists in any case.

             here is the current manifesto - transcribed for your convenient review and sharing:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            ===========================
           </p>
           <p>
            hello james corbett of corbettreport.com
           </p>
           <p>
            reporting to you from the socially  closed streets of western japan
           </p>
           <p>
            in  Walden henry david thoreau famously  observed that there are a thousand  hacking at the branches of evil to one  striking at its root
           </p>
           <p>
            and there can be no  doubt that there are many thousands that  are hacking away at the branches of the  evil that we see spreading out before us  in the name of this pandemic panic  -- diligently deconstructing the  dissembling discourse of the disease  doomsayers and rightfully so i count  myself amongst them
           </p>
           <p>
            however if all we  are doing is smacking down the lies that  are being spread about this pandemic as  soon as they arise then we run the risk  of missing that root of the evil  altogether so allow me if you will to  take one hefty swipe at that root with  my battle axe of truth by clearly  stating and rejecting the new governing  principle for society that we are being  asked to accept on the basis of this  pandemic pandemonium.
           </p>
           <p>
            now this new  governing principle for society of  course is implicit I mean we're going to  sign on to it by our silent consent not  our explicit consent but nonetheless it  rests on a hypothetical
           </p>
           <p>
            a hypothetical  chain of infection that can take place  in the event of a spreading infectious  agent
           </p>
           <p>
            now keep in mind this has nothing  to do with a novel coronavirus [COVID19]  of - this is about a general principle  but the principle holds that if there is  a spreading infectious agent of some  sort that is hypothetically infecting  people around the globe and you might  become infected by this agent
           </p>
           <p>
            and you  might end up passing it on to someone  else
           </p>
           <p>
            who might end up passing it on to  someone else etc etc
           </p>
           <p>
            and somewhere down  that chain of infection someone who is  immunocompromised might end up becoming  infected
           </p>
           <p>
            and they might be part of that  of a fraction of a percentage point of  the population
           </p>
           <p>
            who might die from the  disease
           </p>
           <p>
            and if that were to take place  well of course every single link in that  chain of infection should be classified  as a murderer
           </p>
           <p>
            and in order to prevent  such a mass murder from taking place  governments around the world are not  just empowered but actually obligated to  implement a sort of de facto medical  martial law by following the  pronouncements of the duly unelected  health authorities to do whatever they  deem necessary to prevent such a  hypothetical chain of infection from  taking place -- up to and including:
           </p>
           <p>
            quarantine people within the walls of  their own homes
           </p>
           <p>
            and or entering those  walls to forcibly remove people from  their own homes
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              and at the moment in  most parts of the world do to lock down  most of the transmission that's actually  happening in many countries now is  happening in the household at family  level in some senses transmission has  been taken off the streets and pushed  back into family units now we need to go  and look in families to find those  people who may be sick and remove them  and isolate them in a safe and dignified  manner
             </p>
            </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            we are being asked to accept this  abrogation of our most precious freedoms  including
           </p>
           <p>
            • our freedom to travel
           </p>
           <p>
            • our  freedom of association assembly
           </p>
           <p>
            • our  freedom from arbitrary detention within  the walls of our own home
           </p>
           <p>
            • our freedom of  privacy in transaction and interaction
           </p>
           <p>
            • and other hard-fought freedoms that were  purchased at the price of our  forefathers blood
           </p>
           <p>
            on the basis of a  novel coronavirus that is presenting  presenting a novel existential threat to  humanity that has never before existed
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT THAT OF COURSE IS A LIE
           </p>
           <p>
            because  every single flu season for your entire  life there have been such hypothetical  chains of infection that have taken  place
           </p>
           <p>
            and I have no doubt let's put it  on the table I have no doubt that there  is someone listening to my words right  now  who has been involved in some chain of  infection that has ended up in  some immunocompromised person dying
           </p>
           <p>
            never before has that person had to  think of themselves as a murderer
           </p>
           <p>
            let  alone lock themselves within the  confines of their own home to prevent  such a murder from ever taking place  again
           </p>
           <p>
            but that is what we are being  asked to accept right now and I want  this out on the table
           </p>
           <p>
            BECAUSE IF WE DO  NOT CLEARLY ARTICULATE THIS PRINCIPLE -- that we're being asked to accept then by our silence we will can consent to it  we will tacitly implicitly consent to  what is taking place right now
           </p>
           <p>
            AND I  WANT TO CLEARLY STATE IT
           </p>
           <p>
            AND CLEARLY  REJECT IT

           </p>
           <p>
            it's the people inside the systems that are bad
           </p>
           <p>
            and when I said earlier we're gonna have to do some things that are not good
           </p>
           <p>
            one of the things we're gonna have to get really good at that seems on the surface to be a bad thing is extricated liars and huxter's out of our midst
           </p>
           <p>
            we have to do it we have to stop giving people so much benefit of the doubt
           </p>
           <p>
            a little benefit of that sure
           </p>
           <p>
            we need our we need to use discernment
           </p>
           <p>
            we need to remember what it's like to discriminate
           </p>
           <p>
            we need to be able to tell who is operating from integrity
           </p>
           <p>
            and who isn't
           </p>
           <p>
            people don't have to be perfect
           </p>
           <p>
            that's not what I'm saying
           </p>
           <p>
            but look we overlooked way too much and it's it's the good people's job to sort of point out and push away those who would sell out those who would give up their values for fame or ego or money or any of it
           </p>
           <p>
            we have to
           </p>
           <p>
            that's our job
           </p>

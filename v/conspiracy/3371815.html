            Good lead in for me;
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The pyramid shape is a composition of many sacred maths
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The cross (in correct proportions, think of the Anchor symbol), when flipped, and having it's points connected, create a diamond shape. The Top of the diamond is precise proportions of the pyramid. The bottom proportion is the precise pendulum angles used to measure time. The Diamond itself, reminds me of the description of Metatron.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Meter, Mithra, Measure, Magi â‰  All the same 'magic' in that using two lines, one line crossed over another line in opposing angles (a cross) allows you to create (bind) a space from nothing. Drawing a cross of equal line lengths, and crossing them, is a starting point. Think of Dee's center point, within a circle.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Sacred Geometry. Measuring space, time, movement, distance, weight, and latter mass/depth
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Now look at the cross and duplicate it, rotate it 30 angles and lay it on top of the other cross. You have a stern. You also have the zodiac system. Astrology and Navigation using the same simple, 'holy' symbol of the cross and point.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Planned Obsoletion is the same principle as the burning phoenix or snake eating its own tail. However, we know their interpretation of it is incorrect (burn to renew...), when it should be interpreted as regeneration/re-incarnation. They like the idea of control through this 'means', and 'meaning' (both terms of geometry as well).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The division you mention could be plotted on the same stern symbol mentioned above.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Not coincidentally is that the SIN wave is essentially a circle cut in half, and mirrored (they love duality, not correspondence or continuation ie., regeneration). The SIN wave is also the dollar symbol, the biological reproduction cycle, and an accurate representation of the astrological symbols through their correct translations of nature's cycle of weather. We know they are also hiding the sun and moon and stars all the time with weather modification and geo-engineering.

              Christograms and Chronograms are used throughout Roman writing, Catholic Writings, and Runic writings.

             <p>
              Rune is devised against the cross symbol. Each letter is created from a codice of the cross and point. The Angels of each letter and so on, are representative of various meanings related to biology and nature.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Someone already posted posted that English should be called Anglish. Each letter is a sigil and Anglish/English is probably older than Hebrew. I'll put money on it.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Each letter is constructed against the shape of the cross within a circle. The curve of an 'r' or 'R' or the descending leg of a 'g' or the 90Âº angle within a 'G' all have meaning against the codex.

             <p>
              My guess is, it was an attempt by the realms to create a universally accessible language. Which if you ask many foreigners, they will tell you, English is easier to learn and write.

             <p>
              Russian language characters are very interesting, but another division occurs within phonetics and pronounce.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The division is masterful.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              But you are not wrong, only potentially mis-representing the layer of complexity either deliberately employed, or we just forgot.

            <li>
             <p>
              But since we know ancient history is constantly being destroyed and re-represented to meet new agendas, I think we have real controllers pulling the strings.

              Flag of the united kingdom is interesting, if you are into sailing, conquest, and geo-mancing. I mean Scotland and England make for a nice United Kingdom. And would you have guessed, Red, Blue and White light have enormous effects on us biologically. Now where did I put those stars...

            even mc donalds have to change the recipe for different continents and cultures. why try to convince a group of people to want your recipe which they might not really like when you can just adjust it to fit their taste.
           </p>
           <p>
            is there such a thing as the best? proven out there, no because it depends on whats at play, what population is in question. it may work best in paper, but if people wont buy it whats the point.
           </p>
           <p>
            a one system structure across the board is not advisable because its rigid. its best to let the countries have their own way of doing things that fit their people. if you wish to control a country, you only need to control the head after all. does it matter if you can make them produce beef in kilos or pounds? does it matter whether they march for one god or another to destroy an enemy for you? plus it gives them that warm feeling when its more local... its 'their' burger or 'their country' or ... its just a human thing, though seemingly trivial it should be taken into consideration.

            Most "differences" you gave examples of were someone taking an idea and doing something to it they thought might improve it. At least as far as tangible things go, the differences all stem from people not happy with how something was at first.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for less tangible things, the two systems in place seem to be more about creating a divide of some sort to maintain or gain power.

            So if I am reading correctly you are pondering a conspiracy to build spiritual technologies (belief systems) to subvert the will of humanity to live together in peace?
           </p>
           <p>
            I will follow this train of thought. The tower of Babel, when people are spoke one language. I think that language was of a deeper meaning than just spoken word. Then somehow people could not relate to one another and scattered.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what if the technology was not that of bringing people together, but one of forcing people together that would otherwise not be together. All people are equal, etc.. And we are all of different spiritual cultural minds but forced together under Moloch commerce subverting free will and this subverting the human "ideology" of will.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever is actually happening and whatever the true purpose of different standards if intentional one thing that I always think is that there is some shit out there with a long lifespan or a very interconnected group to pull the kind of history manipulation and bull-honky that has been pulled off...
           </p>
           <p>
            The internet has shed light into the collective conscious and unconscious of the mind of man. Of that 20 or so years I have learned that perception can change rapidly due to propaganda for those in a TV state of willing acceptance.
           </p>
           <p>
            What IS truth? What the fuck is really going on?

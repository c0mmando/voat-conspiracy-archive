            When moonves of CBS got fired for being a rapist, they replaced him with the moron from EA games who ruined battlefield 5 and the battlefront games.The blizzard CFOs that left over the last few weeks went to netflix and square(the new jack dorsey project). The AAA devs put a lot of time and effort into ruining franchises and games. I had just written it off as greed.
           </p>

            But i forgot the context.

            Disney has been approved to purchase FOX. This means that there is one less studio left in Hollywood. Most are now consolidated into bigger companies. This is not secret government actions, but the results of free market correction. Movies and TV are boring. They refused to pay the writers in the 90s, the writers guild strike ended in failure, and now the creatives  left tv and movies to write video games and web comics. The result was that only incompetent people stayed in hollowwood  and only put out the same old politicized garbage. The consolidated studios will not make this easier, but will speed up the processes. Big companies do not take risks, they do not innovate. The propaganda will become too stale and no one will watch it. Short disney.
           </p>
           <p>
            Millennials do not have 200 a month to piss away on cable subscriptions, so they cut the cord and only play video games. Most boomers do not have 200 a month to piss away on cable subscriptions, so they are also cutting the cord. The fact that there is nothing good to watch makes this easier to do. The nfl being over entitled nigger felons expedited things.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the only entertainment industry that is growing is the video games industry. They are attempting to consolidate it into a politicized industry, but there is wayyyy to much foreign competition, as well as indy competition for them to succeed. So the end result is that the nasty executives are fleeing the industry and going back to hollowwood in an attempt to salvage the propaganda apparatus that is rotting away.

            you cant trust the government employees. education was proposed to be just that, but look at the schools now, they redefined the meaning of education, and are left to "teach" transgenderism, and when they teach math or history they do it wrong, the problem is you cant employ every retard to do the important jobs, teachers are the worst retards, they are not up to the important job that is public education, psychologist arent any different, they both believe them owning a PHD makes them wiser than anyone else without one. they are stuck with their ignorant beliefs.

           <p>
            Weird japanese vidya games have psychology and logic mixed in.

           <p>
            Kids learn fundamentals of psychology and logic.

            Ever notice that the manga's never get translated, but the anime's do? Did you not wonder why they spent a lot of effort having communists in Quebec translate anime? Part of why gen z is redpilled is due to the exposure to asian self learning culture in the weird games and cartoons.

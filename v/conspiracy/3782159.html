Let\'s just say that China created a serious hole in the Ozone layers by using lots of damaging chemicals.</p>

<p>So, how do you fix the problem?  Obviously, you need to put China in check, by pulling all production out of China, but China (more specifically, the CCP) has war plans to create use biological warfare to economically cripple America.  What if, Fort Detrick, pretended to share a bio weapon with Canada, knowing that the CCP would seek to get a copy (China is notorious for not inventing, and instead stealing tech), but it was an ineffective version of a real bio weapon (or the known solution is the &quot;Trump Drug&quot;).  China releases it and blames US troops in China at the time (for the military Olympics thing) in a false flag move.  The virus spreads across the world and the world goes into lockdown for these last 2 months.</p>

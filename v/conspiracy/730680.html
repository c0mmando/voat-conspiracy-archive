            Im sorry but I do not give a shit about mass shootings at theaters, sporting events, or any other popular culture event.  All that happens is shitty sheeple get killed.  These are the people that are enjoying their money instead of helping their communities and fixing our country.   If you would rather be frivolous then do your civic duty then fuck you.  People shouldn't be going to movie theaters, people shouldn't be going to sporting events, and people shouldn't be eating out at restaurants when our country men are starving in the streets and dying over seas.  Those people are selfish and I do not care one bit if they die because they are not a benefit to a civilized society.  If your too stupid to learn from the Romans about bread and circuses you deserve to be a worthless pawn.

              Fuck you. Your a piece of shit who lives frivolously on the backs of others.  Your western way of life is literally not possible without someone in the world suffering because of it.   You enjoy that, it makes you a SAD PIECE OF SHIT; not me.  I do not enjoy the suffering of others, YOU DO.  All you piece of shit that do enjoy living frivolously because others are suffering are sub humans and do not deserve to pass on your DNA.  So if someone wipes you out of the gene pool, I will thank them.

                LOL no you can't that is why you won't Because I am not wrong.  Western civilization isn't possible without people suffering in the third world.  Are you a troll or naive?   Either way it doesn't matter because your a piece of shit to your core to actually argue that the western way of life isn't detrimental.
               </p>
               <p>
                Go into any target, walmart, home depot, nike, sports authority, or any department store.  Almost everything in those store comes from across seas.  It is made across seas because its cheaper.  Why is it cheaper because the workers are exploited in terrible ways. From working 70 hours in a row to working for pennies and everything in between and outside. Not to mention over 1/3 of all america's food is wasted when there are people starving not only around the world but in america's own street. You shop at stores with restaurants that throw away food literally every 20 mins.  You go to restaurants where every couple hours they prepare a feast for more people then are going to eat there and they throw the excess away.
               </p>
               <p>
                Where do you think all the rare earth elements that are in your computer come from? They come from exploited war torn countries in the middle east and impoverish african nations.   Why is it that Africa is one of the most mineral rich continents on the earth yet the poorest?  BECAUSE ITS UNDER RESOURCE SLAVERY BY WESTERN POWERS.  Debeers isn't an African company; its a western company exploiting African resources at the expense of Africans for westerners.
               </p>
               <p>
                Westerners are so bad that they exploit third world nations for low priced goods, but you are on a whole another level of piece of shit to actually straight up deny your way of life doesn't come at the expense of others.    I used to think everyone has a right to live.  But just like we eradicate viruses and we got rid of "the dog that bites the hand that feeds"; we can't feel a shred of pity when
                <strong>
                 sub humans
                </strong>
                like you--
                <strong>
                 who have no value for anyone other then their personal connections
                </strong>
                --are wiped off the earth.   Maybe if one day all the apathetic pieces of shit like you are gone there will be no need for people thinking like I do.  But you, your way of life, and your belief structures are morally corrupt, and your a piece of shit for trying to denying that exploiting third world countries is wrong.

               <p>
                I truly believe your are inhuman, unevolved, what ever descriptor you want. People like you truly do not care for anyone other then
                <strong>
                 themselves and their personal relations
                </strong>
                , that is why you are not human.   That is why I do not shed a tear when people like you are wiped off the earth, because
                <strong>
                 you do not give a shit that your country is killing tens of thousands ever year
                </strong>
                .  Your more concerned with going to movies and frivolous shit like that. Just like we cannot shed a tear when a virus that preys on us is eradicated, so must we not care when parasites like you are eradicated.  Parasite is a parasite whether its a sub human trying to drag their own race down or a virus.

               <p>
                None of this even accounts for the exploitation of your own countrymen; like miners, first responders, the elderly, worst of all veterans, any many more. Or how your country has interfered in the affairs with sovereign nation and has shit all over international law and the Geneva convention since WWII.

            John Beilman warned us on pol 4chan this was coming. He owned a corporation that makes spec ops comms devices and a battery charger for a spec ops comms device was found in Paddock's room... HIS ROOM! The FBI, ATF, and FEMA checked into the MB 2 days prior to the shooting which explains how the charger got in Paddock's room. It also explains how he hauled up 599$ pounds of guns and bullets. He didn't the FBI, ATF, and FEMA did. The FBI, ATF, and FEMA were in his suite before the shooting and brought Paddock's guns for him. Paddock was working for the government. The FBI handled surveillance and comms, the ATF handled his guns, and FEMA is used for man made disasters and natural disasters and they were there because this was planned to be even bigger and they either did not want that or they did. Those windows on the MB are 800 pounds and hurricane proof idk if the windows are bulletproof and i think the windows were smash, cut, blown, and shot out. The nitrate and tannerite was for blowing the windows too. This was no sting i think. The three letters wanted this shooting and killing. Either because they were payed by Al Waleed Bin Talal to assassinate Mohammad  Bin Salman, or they hated Trump, republicans, white people, or both reasons. I think because when they got word on Beilman's comms device MBS was in the Tropicana and not Four Seasons they shot the concert to lure him into the open. Paddock was the gambler in debt set up as a fall guy patsy who had no idea this was a assassination and a fuck Trump message. He was suckered into what he thought was an entrapment scheme similar to Operation: Fast &amp; Furious. Only he was the one entrapped by the lie and promise of escaping debt. And guilt over his bank robber father and Stephen thought he could atone for hs fathers mistakes and sins. The first couple of sounds and shots in William Ramsey's other video "The shooting began at Las Vegas massacre earlier then publicly understood" was snipers from the Saudi royal air force or three letter snipers betraying Stephen and making him a fall guy patsy and shooting into his room and window from a farther location and distance. And fire alarms and smoke alarms were from the glass being blown up by nitrate and tannerite and shot out in Stephen's room and other rooms on other floors which explains smoke and fires in other rooms on other floors. Once Paddock was sniped and killed the FBI, ATF, FEMA, ISIS, Mossad, Saudi air force snipers, and Mexican drug cartel and MS13 had already assumed a octagon or hexagon formation and firing position on rooftops and the RV's and trailers and some shooters were in the concert crowd. And they brought SUV's and helicopters along too. And they were also shooting in casinos to rob the casinos. They were going to kill every one on the Vegas strip and rob every casino. Jesus Campos was shot by god knows who maybe he shot himself and there are videos of him on youtube and pictures of him on the internet in Mexico with know ISIS and drug cartel members. FBI ATF FEMA supplied ISIS Saudi and drug cartel with guns to rob the Vegas strip and assassinate a Saudi prince, and to literally fuck Trump. Mohammad Bin Salman is a Trump ally remember. It was never about the entrapment and sting. It was about robbery and fucking Trump. I hate Trump but this is wrong and not how you fuck some one. This is how you get everyone to hate the FBI, ATF, FEMA, mossad, and all the other terrorists and criminal elements and groups involved + Saudi, Israel... and the LVMPD for being a part of the cover up and letting the FBI and everyone else involved get away with it. The ISIS and cartel shot from the Mandalay Bay windows at random and went into casinos and to the hooters shooting and robbing with FBI, ATF, FEMA, Mossad, Saudi's. the professionals and Mossad went into the concert crowd to kill and on the RV's and trailers and low level rooftops to kill concert goers, choppers with belt fed guns were Mossad and FBI, ATF, and FEMA. And the hexagon and octagon formations were really high on the higher rooftops those shooters those guys were Mossad, Saudi, FBI, ATF, FEMA. Mafia owns all casinos in Vegas. Mafia extort businesses and casinos in Vegas. The casinos, hotel, resorts, strip clubs, businesses, etc all pay a protection fee to the Mafia or else suffer Mafia violence. And the Mafia activated Mafia private security forces the night of the massacre to repel and kill the shooters responsible fucking up the mobs business and racket in Las Vegas on the Vegas strip the night of the shooting and do what their payed to do in the event of something like this. John Beilman told NSA and acedemi/formerlyblackwater and they went in too with 8 - 16 shooters they engaged some of those responsible and prevented something worse. CIA was involved at some point watching and went in. I don't know if they went in on the NSA and acedemi's side or the other side or both with amoral acedemi and NSA being the good guys and the others being villains and some in CIA being good... Others in CIA being evil. This all connects to the Saudi coup in November 3 - 4 2017, Paradise papers November 5 2017,  Sutherland Springs November 5 2017, Parkland Stone Man Douglas Valentines day, San Bruno, Sante Fe, and other false flag mass shootings. Some one else on pol 4chan said 1 day 24 hours before the church Texas shooting to watch for something big happening in Texas and they also said in a rhyme the FBI is going to cause a false flag. October 20... 2 weeks before the Texas shooting and paradise papers a reddit anon predicted the paradise papers on November 5 2017.

What's with this Mandela effect type shit where Christians are all saying Yahweh instead of Jesus all of a sudden? No one ever said Yahweh other than these weird "Jesus was black", black supremacists types. Now it seems all Christians are always saying Yahweh. Another point, I'm a gunsmith, firearms dealer, I've studied ballistics on a forensics level, and I've studied sound reactions in relations with supersonic and sub sonic ballistics. The audio from phone videos (not the best source but keeps it a really pretty consistent) that I have heard have had up to at least 4 shooters shooting at once and shooting random bursts as individual shooters. I've heard what sounded exactly like a full auto 9mm submachine gun with cycle rates around 800rom (rounds per minute) which suggest it was likely an h&amp;k MP5 that was closest to the audience and a near by m4 m16 in 5.56 (223 caliber). these were close to the microphone on the phone and picked it up clearly and the sound difference is obvious even if you aren't a firearms expert like myself. My mother can hear it clearly and it's not an echo. There are evidence of  at least 2 belt fed full auto machine guns. These weren't 50round snell drums or 100rnd dual drum c-beta mags and damn sure weren't surefire quad stack 60 round stick mags. They damn sure weren't from a slidefire style stock on a traditional AR15. These are real select fire/ full auto machine guns. The larger guns were likely the m249saw that were on the 4th or 5th floor, not 320+ feet up in the air. This guy saying it's an AK47 is full of shit. Also, every gun has some level of flash out of the barrel (muzzle side) it's the reason for flash supressors and muzzle brakes. An AK47 has a very destict sound and what I hear in the audio wasn't from a heavy and slower velocity  AK47 round that usually run 2300 feet per second while the 5.56mm can range from 2700-almost 3000fps depending on the barrel length, bullet grain weight and powder charge. The m4 is a 5.56 and so is the m248 saw. The m4 has a slower cycle rate and a crisper snappy shot sound while the m249 has that heavier thumping rhythmic beat, like was heard from the distance. All of my military, PSC, ballistics technician friends including myself have studied the audio and comparison fired the same types of fire arms in semi auto versions from different distances and cropped out the space between shots to mimic the full auto fire rate and our findings point to at least one 9mm mp5 on or near the ground that is with in 100 yards (more like 60-40 yards) of the crowd. That was likely the shooter from behind the fence that the officer jumped the fence to stop, despite the officer only being armed with his personal concealed carry revolver. The M4 was close (with in 100 yards and was probably the only suppressed gun there) because short barreled M4 blow a massive fire ball. A suppressor only take 30db off of a super sonic standard 233 round so it's still extremely loud and not hearing safe (this isn't the poof sound from movies) the suppressor would almost completely eliminate the fire ball from the muzzle. Then you have at least two belt fed fire arms staged around the 4th or 5th floor of Mandalay in both the left and right sides facing the crowd. It is also very likely 2 others were staged in the monolithic collombs (they are hollow with stairs inside) at the construction site just behind and over looking the stage itself. Which many people pointed to during the shooting. A police body cam video even shows a ground level shooter on the other side of a chain link fence that when he shoots a single rounds you see the air blast flap the tarp on the fence. Which I've seen thousands of times at a gun range. There were shooter at other hotels as well but no one is talking about them. The ballachio*(can't spell it) and another casino were both shot up and put into lock down. Men ran up and shot full auto bursts through the front door of the bellacio and apparently the other casino had the men go into the casino section and open fire and yelled something and walked out. The official narrative is BS and I doubt we will ever know the truth.﻿

            Awesome. I'll check these out. I still have a bunch that I'd saved and downloaded. Hadn't really followed up after I realized it was a hoax, so had kinda forgotten about all of it. Needs a relook for some reason since fact sometimes mimics fiction.

            10:16 pm When a 911 operator asked the caller if she saw the shooter, the woman who was inside the Route 91 venue at the time replied: “I think we saw the guy flying in a helicopter. […] You guys need officers in the sky because he’s flying in a helicopter.” (Keep in mind the LVMPD helicopter did not show up anywhere near the vicinity until 10:25 pm)

            Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns. He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05). At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal. Only a few magazines are loaded. He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor. That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate) The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place. Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins. Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here. You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby. I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.
           </p>
           <p>
            What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas. (Saudi princes have been known to do this) He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards. As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince. The video can be seen here.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo">

            </a>
            They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up. BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins. Hence the firefight at the airport. Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can. A few are armed with sidearms. They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet. Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night. A few are killed. Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call. They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above. That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana. They start panicking. If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well. They come up with a plan. They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below. They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman. So they kill Paddock. They break a window. They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below. After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded! Holy fuck. They start reloading as fast as possible. This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds. One of them gets an idea. Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport. This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape. So he goes and attempts just that. Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up. By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door. So they just unload on him. This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door. Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the assassins are getting nervous. They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing. They fire as much as they can. They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run. But the swat team starts knocking on the door. Fuck. The assassins realize they're screwed. So the first one shoots himself. (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end). The second assassin isn't so sure. He doesn't want to die. So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.
           </p>

            The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies. They start asking questions. But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over. They quickly assess the situation. They realize the implications. They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paddock is made the patsy. Why? Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen. One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia. And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wew lads, I know. Quite a story. Now, let's fast forward to one month later.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th. This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group. This was their last ditch effort to kill him. OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt. We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th. I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad. And who was just killed? Yes. The son of Muqrin, Mansour. Mansour's death was retaliation. I have no doubt of it. He was executed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, now that this has happened, what's next? Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade. It will expose their connections to the DNC. We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East. Then, they'll all be executed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for reading.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt. He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency. However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

             Vegas here LOVE THIS theory Hypercbyerpastelgoth!.  Sure seems way more plausible than the official bullshit.
             <br/>
             Mr Burgandy on YT realized that they released ZERO 911 calls from 11:15 to 11:30 pm so clearly that is a time frame is key. Also I have a real feeling that Campos is undercover Metro not a security officer.  The casinos use them for drug busts in the clubs.  That would explain his no guard card.  It would also explain why people saw him around town at crappy motels (making payments for rent for confidential witnesses)  Also no one at Mandaly knew him or Schuck - someone on one shift would know them!
I think Trump knows.  He flew out here the next day and met with victims and Sheldon Adelson. - not Murren, not Lombardo.

             paddock -CIA asset. All day long. I bet they love people with familial ties to the agency, because they are easier to control, and less of another loose end, less likely to turn.. Im sure theres even more reasons I havnt thought of.

           </p>
           <p>
            I know that's a mouthful of names, but bear with me. Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017? Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman? I do. It was a spectacle. Why was he greeted so welcomingly? After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand. Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies? Women can drive there now. Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet? Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit? Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE? What could have caused this?
           </p>
           <p>
            To answer this, we have to look a little further back. Back to around 2010.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all goes back to fracking. You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity. And they were ruthless. OPEC. The cartel of gasoline. You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities. If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it. And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then came the fracking boom. Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC. This made them nervous. So, they did what they always do. They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades. What was their objective? To bankrupt these fracking businesses. KSA is rich. Very rich. They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble. Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016? It was ridiculous, wasn't it? But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become. So many of these business didn't go bankrupt. So they took another step. To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment. So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party. Why? Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations. Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through? Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states. Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign? She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil. But... this didn't work either. Fracking continued. And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America. They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists. They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so. But nope. We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years. Hmmm... big problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if you're King Salman, what do you do? Well, there's only one thing you can do. Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy. To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil. They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch. To do that, he needed the help of the USA. And that's where President Trump comes in.
           </p>
           <p>
            You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting. It was a business meeting. King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price. Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding. No more contributions to American politics. No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups. King Salman took the deal. All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive. ISIS was retreating. Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition. Yay. All good up to this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now comes the bad
           </p>
           <p>
            Not all the royalties in KSA are into this. They don't like losing the power they once had. What's worse, they don't want to become liberal. They now start resenting King Salmon. They start plotting against him. At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).
           </p>
           <p>
            October 1, 2017. The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal. Who was occupying that whole floor that night? I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week. Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty. We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad. We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time.

           </p>
           <p>
            The plan is to take out the crown prince. Then kill King Salman. With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line? Yup. The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin. So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad. Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them. This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor. They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing. Now, here's what happened that night:

            Sorry but the muzzle flare from the helicopter is kinda weak. Looks more like nav lights with a shaky camera that doesn't stay on it long enough to make a determination.

             I disagree with you. I showed a video to my friend who said, "Someone is shooting from that chopper." Who was my friend's previous employer? U.S. Army. What was his job? Helicopter mechanic. I will take his especially educated opinion over anyone else's.

             I agree with you. The flashes seem too rhythmic to match the random rates of gunfire from the videos with sound.

              You can clearly hear two, or more, different weapons firing, and from the ricochet sounds the weapons were apparently in different locations.

             Try the opposite of whatever you have selected for that. For me, one works, the other doesn't. Maybe that can fix it for you.

             maybe your network setup is blocking something. I'm not really sure how it (BitChute) works, but it is supposedly p2p.

              I flashed ddwrt on to this router, and I've never experienced any issues with any other sources. Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Maybe it's my amd gpu. I doubt I'll ever know.

               I hope they try to figure it out, you aren't the first person i have heard of having problems (unless it is you every time) where nothing works. does bittorrent work in your current configuration, do you subscribe to  a vpn that you could try?

               events? what events? Do you know how a massive psyop works? First and foremost, is the flood of confusing and contradicting witness accounts and media reports. Funny how the OP is so concerned about his particular videos being scrubbed from YT, when nearly every video that fucks up his narrative has ALREADY BEEN SCRUBBED.

               Vegas and Sandy Hook are exactly the same &gt;&gt; Complex psyops to confuse the public and prevent a consensus from forming.  The CIA and the FBI are CRIMINALS and TRAITORS.

              Just before the LV incident, a plane with fifteen?? princes was shot down in or near Saudi Arabia. If that info is correct, it was not a coincidence, in my opinion. How does the plane being shot down play into the story? Apparently someone wanted a lot of Saudi Princes dead. The top three floors of the Mandalay are owned by a group of Saudis.

               It was a helicopter and from what I understand, the circumstances are all unconfirmed or verified. There is so much fake news and disinformation flying around, it is impossible to find the truth.  That is why this thread and the top comment are so damn ridiculous. The commenter has no posts to this subverse, and yet, he's an expert on the Vegas shooting/False Flag?

               Who else owns the Four Seasons ( top floors ) at the Mandalay? a: BILL GATES -- Interesting that he fails to mention that.
              </p>
              <p>
               He also fails to mention Alwaleed's stake in Twitter, you know, the site that throttles all data to make it appear Trump is hated...

                Good. Alaweed looks like the person pulling the levers of power here, but as you said there are lots of contradictory scenarios floating around. It's typical of intel, from whatever country, to put out conflicting stories in such cases, as you probably know. Several groups would prefer to muddy the waters so the real story never gets out. The shot-down plane and the LV incident within a few days point to a power struggle or an attempted coup, but how the pieces fit together, I don't know. How were US intel agencies involved?

            It's interesting to consider the history of the term.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Triggered" emerged from studies of severely sexually abused kids with PTSD. The severe trauma they have experienced leaves them vulnerable to certain stimuli that were connected to their abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somehow the fact that a huge percentage of young people are getting "triggered" doesn't seem to ring any alarm bells with anyone.  The denial of widespread child abuse continues even while our whole system adjusts to deal with the psychological effects of widespread trauma.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point the term has crossed over to the point where it has lost its original meaning, and people use it to mean "upset," but that's where it originally came from, studies of PTSD.

             It's almost like it was pushed mainstream to devalue the term. Note that it became popular and common place right before the big sex scandals hit.

            I definitely think you are on to something.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the goal was originally to create useful idiots. The elites wanted cattle. Cattle are easy to control if you know their triggers and psychology but are dangerous if you don't know what you are doing. The elites fucked up and created sheep. Even a child can show up and make a bit of noise and get a rise out of the sheep and even herd them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the environmental variable is what is faulty in the programing. They need to create an environment that reinforces the programing, but it seems goys don't ever stabilize. They just get dumber and more helpless or they awaken and go feral. Few ever stabilize into useful idiot. We see this same thing at play with replacement migration. Elites hope for a stable class of useful idiots and always fail so they must bring in more people to replace the replacements.

              Plantation owners in Hawaii did this. A steady stream of bringing in a new race to replace the ones that smartened up,  went feral and refused to work their shit jobs. They thought they had found the perfectly controllable pets when they brought in the japanese and kept bringing them in till the majority of the population was Japs and then the Japs took over.
             </p>
             <p>
              Niggers and spice aren't useful enough so now they bring in muslims because they think they can control them instead they are letting our doom in by the front door.

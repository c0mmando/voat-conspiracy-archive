<p>So they are saying that these are obsolete and concern the German Reich anyway, but wait...</p>
<p>2) Even current government confirms after a question of the far-left party, that the federal constitutional court has confirmed that the German Reich did not cease to exist and did neither by capitulation or occupation go extinct, and that Germany is not its successor but that they are identical.</p>

<p>3) Japan gained peace treaties in 1951 in Treaty of San Francisco, Germany never did....</p>
<p>4) instead they claim &quot;Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany&quot; settles sovereignty and reparations, when now countries are still demanding reparations regularly (Greece especially) and they clearly confirm that the treaty for the stay of foreign nations from 1954 is still intact, which even extends to an unknown number of atomic weapons from USA stationed in former West-Germany and all-time air-space access from NATO and occupying forces.</p>

<p>5) And now we have a chancellor that after her last victory threw away the German flag:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoe3sfhXE1c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoe3sfhXE1c</a></p>
<p>6)And a completely leftist-propagandist media from newspaper to TV, censorship of any Islam-criticism, while anybody that comes here illegally is declared German, if he wants (more or less).
I stopped reading almost all media outlets, it seems they everyday just test how far they can go already with their working slaves, there have been idiotic articles in all forms and shapes were clever experts wanted all Germans to learn Arabic or all other kinds of atrocities.</p>
<p>7) The whole proceedings are almost as insane and perverse than what was going on here many years ago. All crime by people arriving here is swept under the rug and everything people do, that lived here before the planned destruction is highlighted as xenophobic and racist, and that people are not necessarily German, even before this complete insanity we had plenty of migrant workers, that found a home here, without becoming intensive criminals and assaulting this country, I am of this background too.</p>
<p>8) Combine all that with the economic warfare against all the &quot;German&quot; companies that are suddenly sued for billions.
At the moment I think we will not even see the 2021 elections it all seems completely insane.
Parts of Germany are removing the oath by politicians to the German people to not discriminate.
How could people be so hateful to their own country? Well I guess that almost everybody here is completely innocent in regards to what they are being hated and punished for....</p>
<p>This ship is sinking fast...</p>
<p>Well i could point out so many more things, it\'s obviously a complex thematic... how people can even think that all this is normal is beyond my comprehension and UN and UNHRC are among the worst offenders imo. And obviously it is not only Germany suffering from all this.</p>',

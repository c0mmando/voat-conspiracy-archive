            Don't let it get to you. Alot of people are conditioned (i hate to say that, but it's true) by the term "conspiracy theorist". Funny enough the term was actually made a ridiculing one by a CIA disinfo program decades ago, just shows that it worked out for them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always find that if i'm in a community where other people don't appear to be discussing world events with a hint of asking their own questions, i try to stay away from those discussions for the sake of not being labelled as the crazy guy. If you try and plant a seed (wake people up) more often than not, you'll become a laughing stock or worse, banned for being a looney or "mr/ms tin foil". Although, if people start a discussion asking questions about a certain event in history, i'll happily debate with them regardless of what the community is about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Deep down, i think alot of people are interested in "theorizing" everything about the world (isn't it human nature?), but many create a barrier that stops them. IE; there may be a gaming board somewhere where EVERYONE is a conspiracy theorist, but none of the members let the other ones know their views, because after all, they are in a gaming community, and are there to play the games. Even a conspiracy theorist needs some escapism one in a while. Many people hold back their views, even if they have an open mind, as they want a place to fit in.

            We're being attacked on many levels... people don't realize they're getting caught up in it, then they start attacking everyone around them do to misunderstanding... we are in a very interesting time friends.

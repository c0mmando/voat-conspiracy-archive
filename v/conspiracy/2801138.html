<p>You know how the (((administration))) is talking with Mexico? It\'s to let them know what\'s going and to pay them off. Trump wasint threatening to take money away he was threatening to give money. I\'m not sure of the cost on this, I\'d imagine 2-5 million dollars. It\'s a very small sum to pay for another 4 years in office, I would even bet Israel is helping with the fake migration caravan. Why israel help? Well trump being president in their wet dream come true, they get a bunch of kikes in office and kushner. Trump is by far Israel\'s greatest asset, and remember Israel\'s slogan - war by deception. These kikes are master reality benders, and you ALWAYS have to critical think on whatever they say, NEVER take their word as-is. Or you to may be the losers of trumps grand game. </p>

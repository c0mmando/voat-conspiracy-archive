            Well she's on the hot seat now, she obviously fucked up badly
           </p>
           <p>
            from the article above
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               The evidence included a document found at the compound titled, “Phrases of a Terrorist Attack,” that listed detailed instructions on how to plan and execute a terror attack, according to CNN, which had a chance to review the prosecutors’ filing.
              </strong>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               It specifically listed “instructions for ‘The one-time terrorist,’ instructions on the use of a ‘choke point,’ a location ‘called the ideal attack site,’ the ‘ability to defend the safe haven,’ the ‘ability to escape-perimeter rings,’ and ‘sniper position detection procedure,'” the filing reportedly read.
              </strong>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors filed the evidence in a bid to persuade Judge Sarah Backus to reconsider the $20,000 bond she had set for each suspect on Aug. 13.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               The judge argued at the time that prosecutors had failed to convince her that the Islamists posed a threat to the community
              </strong>
             </strong>
             as per their child abuse charges. She therefore set a $20,000 signature bond for each suspect and ordered that they wear ankle monitors and maintain contact with their attorneys.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              <strong>
               The judge allowed for bond despite knowing that the suspects had been found at the compound conducting weapons training with 11 abused children. She also knew that the lead perpetrator, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj, is the son of Siraj Wahhaj, a controversial Brooklyn imam of the same name who was named a co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings that left six dead and 1,000+ injured.
              </strong>
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The evidence submitted by prosecutors this week also included quotes from the abused children about the other suspects, including Wahhaj’s partner, Jany Leveille; Wahhaj’s sisters, Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj; and a fifth individual identified only as Lucas Morten.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the children reportedly told authorities that Morten had “stated he wished to die in Jihad, as a martyr,” prosecutors revealed in their motion. “At times, Jany Leveille would laugh and joke about dying in Jihad as would Subhanna Wahhaj.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors also cited a letter from Morton to Wahhaj’s brother urging him to follow Allah “until he makes you die a martyr as you wanted and the only way is by joining the righteous.”
            </p>
            <p>
             As of Sunday, it appeared all five suspects still remained free, though two of them — Wahhaj and his partner — were reportedly hit with additional charges Friday for the death of a child. At the compound in New Mexico authorities found the body of a child believed to be Wahhaj’s son.

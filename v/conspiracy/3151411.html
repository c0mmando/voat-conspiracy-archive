            Plate carrier is code for body armor and Paddock had a camera spying on the hallway from a cart with plates on it covering up the camera and plates can hold sushi and comped sushi slang has something to do with all this other slang. It's all like slang.

            Even though the circumstances are different in Las Vegas and in the case of Orlando, in both events, law enforcement struggled to piece together a timeline, quickly followed by a series of revisions in the official story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strange Profile, Strange Coincidence?
           </p>
           <p>
            As mainstream media and police dance around certain details that may or may not be associated with the man said to be responsible for the Las Vegas mass shooting, a mixture of raw public analysis, military expertise and online investigative work has shed light on a compelling case that could be discussed for sometime.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s an interesting section from an article about two Twin Cities professors that are studying the psychological patterns of mass shootings. Here’s a passage from a recent MPR news report that suggests that Paddock’s killer profile is very unusual when compared with more than hundred case entries:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Jillian Peterson, a Hamline University assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice, and James Densley, an associate professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University, hope to better understand why mass shootings happen and identify ways to prevent them.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shooter is a little different, compared to the data we have,” said Peterson, a forensic psychologist. “He’s significantly older than average, the average age is mid-30s. Social media presence is also something we usually see, some sort of radicalization on social media or wanting to go viral on social media. In this case the shooter was not active on social media, didn’t seem to have any social media accounts.”
           </p>
           <p>
            While some have attempted to make sense of the Las Vegas shooting tragedy, there are reports of a heavy revamp of security in the hospitality industry through the use of gunfire detection systems, X-ray, body scanners and facial recognition in the wake of this confusing, if not partly manufactured event.
           </p>
           <p>
            The concept of a lone wolf killer in today’s world has reprogrammed the public mind just as the serial killer phenomenon did decades ago. This new fear-based saga has ushered in improbable Hollywood-style scenarios, inducing a frozen apathy across the masses – rather than looking deeply at crime scene forensics or pour over piles of collected data, these Daily Shooter crimes hold the public psyche hostage until the next unexplained mass tragedy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Undoubtedly, modern America’s most deadliest mass shooting has left a number of questions in its wake.

            COINTELPRO, Gangs and Counter-gangs
           </p>
           <p>
            Some questions have emerged from the ether of the internet concerning the FBI and the Las Vegas shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the past several years, the FBI has been routinely caught foiling their very own “terror plots.”
           </p>
           <p>
            QUESTION: Is it possible the FBI or any or intelligence agency played some part in the Las Vegas massacre – whether inadvertently or otherwise?
           </p>
           <p>
            In the search for answers regarding the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies that have come into question, there’s none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that resulted in the entrapment four men who participated in a fabricated event created by the bureau.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here’s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how a FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot:
           </p>
           <p>
            “The “Newburgh Four” now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh’s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot – including $250,000 to one man – and free holidays and expensive cars.
           </p>
           <p>
            As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets. “There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?” said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The reputation of the FBI has suffered greatly in the recent past as well as over the past couple of decades. Following the 1993 WTC bombing, the FBI was revealed to have been ‘handling’ Emad A. Salem, a former Egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the bomb plot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Domestically in America, it has been well documented that the FBI created a counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO, not only as a way to influence, but also a way to disrupt and coerce political factions from the inside out. The FBI program infiltrated countless groups and movements across the political spectrum.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to reports these groups included but were not limited to the following,
           </p>
           <p>
            “The Black Panther Party, The Communist Party of America, the Ku Klux Klan, the Socialist Workers Party, the New Left, the Students for a Democratic Society, the American Indian Movement, the Chicano Movement, the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement, Communist groups, anti-war organizations, Hollywood stars sympathetic to these groups, and civil rights leaders.”
           </p>
           <p>
            On March 8th 1971, “secret files” from the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, were allegedly stolen and subsequently released to media organizations, revealing for the first time the scope of the FBI’s domestic spying and infiltration on political and protest groups in America. After two months of planning, a group calling themselves “The Citizens’ Commission to Investigate the FBI,” decided to break-in to a small town FBI office the same night as the first historic bout between heavyweight boxers Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the Citizens’ Commission members involved in the Media office burglary were never revealed and rather strangely, the case was never solved – even though 200 FBI agents had worked the case. In fact, “there were no alarms, surveillance cameras, or locks on most of the filing cabinets,” at the FBI office in Media.
           </p>
           <p>
            The courts later ordered the FBI to reveal part of their counterintelligence program, disclosing six operations run by FBI field offices throughout the country. The documents also revealed a specific emphasis to funnel covert aid to “White Hate Groups,” from 1964-71, that largely diverted those funds to the KKK, as long as they choose COINTEL PRO targets. Similarly, FBI efforts to infiltrate New Left groups and the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) fixating on ant-war, student and feminist causes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Between 1956 and 1971 the FBI’s controversial program influenced and radicalized hundreds of left-wing and right-wing groups to control and neutralize political dissidents across America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also throughout the 1960’s and the 1970’s the CIA’s Operation CHAOS “collected substantial amounts of information on domestic dissidents from 1967 to 1973,” as admitted by the CIA. The secretive intelligence operation was also related to the overseas Phoenix Program (Operation Phoenix) which was used in Vietnam to tear apart the political infrastructure through the use of informants, agent provocateurs, and targeted assassinations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly though, the prototype for modern deep state intelligence programs goes back to the formation of the Office of the Coordinator of Information (COI) an intelligence propaganda agency in 1941 that was succeeded by Office of Strategic Services (OSS) a wartime intelligence apparatus created in 1942 that focused on psychological warfare. OSS agents also worked closely with  British Security Coordination (BSC).
           </p>
           <p>
            Similarly, on a global scale, NATO’s paramilitary-style stay-behind-armies were said to have comprised Operation GLADIO. The origins of GLADIO have been well documented and the secretive counterintelligence operation has been linked to a wave of right-wing ‘false flag’ terror attacks across Europe throughout the 1950’s into the 1980’s. The anti-communist organizational designs were directly connected to that of the CIA and MI6 in particular, with the US and British special forces reportedly facilitating the training.
           </p>
           <p>
            From this, we can view global operations like GLADIO in addition to the post-9/11 “War On Terror” security surge as a form of ‘power politics’ used to aggressively influence the foreign policy of other nations through the use of covert militarization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Below Dr. Daniele Ganser discusses his seminal 2005 book (above left photo), NATO’s Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe. Ganser asserts that covert armies were used to subvert the political interests of various nations through the implementation of a Cold-War era ‘strategy of tension’…

            Here at 21WIRE, we’ve kept a running report on ‘known wolf’ actors involved in many attacks on Western soil, here’s another look at other suspicious intelligence informant and terror cases that have held that distinction over the years:

            Following America’s previous most deadly mass shooting in Orlando were reports revealing that the FBI had a close relationship with the suspected attacker through the use of a well-known confidential informant. Similarly, recent reports state that “FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged ‘home grown’ ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas.” 21WIRE previously uncovered suspicious elements in the cartoon event in Garland back when it happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            QUESTION: Could this have been this case in the Las Vegas shooting, or was something else at play?
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after the Pulse nightclub shooting attack in Orlando, it was revealed that the suspected gunman Omar Mateen had been attending services at a Mosque, meeting with a known FBI informant named Marcus Dwayne Robertson (see left – also played role in 1993 WTC bombing). Robertson was a former US Marine turned bank robber turned radical imam. Here’s this passage from Fox News describing Robertson’s role in backdrop of the Orlando shooting saga:
           </p>
           <p>
            “It is no coincidence that this happened in Orlando,” said a law enforcement source familiar with Robertson’s history of recruiting terrorists and inciting violence. Mateen was enrolled in [Robertson’s online] Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Robertson and several associates were rounded up for questioning early Sunday, according to law enforcement sources, a development his attorney refused to confirm or deny.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in June of 2016, here at 21WIRE, we discussed how the most important aspect of the FBI supplied 911 transcript had gone virtually unnoticed – as there was nothing in the contents of the transcript that discussed an actual shooting occurring inside of the Pulse nightclub.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the report was a basic outline of ‘America’s largest mass shooting‘ it failed to account for any of the shootings said to have occurred within the interior of Pulse. There was no mention of bar patrons being shot or reportedly shot at in the FBI’s official narrative. It’s as if the mainstream media and authorities left out the biggest piece of the investigation, as the implications of who shot who and when are extremely significant forensically speaking.

            “Danley, 62, who travels on an Australian passport, arrived in the Philippines from Tokyo on September 15, then left for Hong Kong on September 22 and flew back to the Philippines on September 25, said Maria Antoinette Mangrobang, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As the media stylized profile of Paddock and those around him has grown, the FBI, police and media diverted the public’s attention to Danley, Paddock’s girlfriend, a former casino hostess who was supposedly out of the country in the Philippines at the time of the Mandalay Bay shooting. Danley’s trip was paid for by Paddock, who is stated to have also wired $127,000 to her family reportedly to buy a home.

            Kip Herriage a former financial advisor and venture capitalist from Wall Street published a reportexamining suspicious trading involving MGM on a sister site linked to his website Virtual Research Advisory. The startling passage below suggests that there was an excessive amount of shares sold off by MGM CEO/Chairman in the weeks leading up to the Las Vegas shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            “We will examine the share price movements of two gun manufacturers (American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger) and the share price movement of MGM (which owns Mandalay Bay). We will also examine additional financial events surrounding MGM, including what can only be referred to as massive levels of insider selling in the shares of MGM, by the CEO/Chairman and MGM officers/directors. As you’ll see, more than $200 million in MGM shares were sold in the weeks leading up to the attack.”

            Las Vegas Active Shooter Drills
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in 2014, during another high-profile Las Vegas shooting, 21WIRE revealed that Nevada officials sought to increase their budget to thwart potential terror related activity for 2014, according to KoloTV in Las Vegas:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Nevada’s Homeland Security Commission on Thursday approved a grant allocation plan that will increase funding for the region’s fusion center to nearly $1.1 million, up from $750,000 this year.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports Las Vegas was ranked too low on a threat assessment list to receive federal funding in the current federal budget, a move that brought swift criticism from Nevada officials.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the coming fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, Las Vegas will receive $950,000 in the special funding. That’s on top of statewide counter terrorism funding totaling $3.5 million.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Later it was learned that funds were said to have been allocated for 20 additional ongoing programs throughout the state.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Las Vegas Review-Journal revealed the city’s longtime practice of active shooter scenarios started in 2009 in the wake of a series suspicious intelligence linked attacks in Mumbai, India.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Emergency responders in Las Vegas have spent years training to respond to a mass casualty event such as Sunday night’s massacre, officials said Thursday.
           </p>
           <p>
            We knew what to do,” Clark County Fire Department Chief Greg Cassell told reporters. “It was much grander than we ever envisioned. However, we were able to handle it because of our people, our training, our professionalism and our equipment and our relationships.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The report continued, with a focus on specific locations for shooter drills:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Our job is to work with all first responding agencies and coordinate a response,” Clarkson said.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the plan was developed, emergency responders ran drills at hospitals, hotels, schools and malls.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Because that’s where historically these things are taking place,” Cassell said.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, the night of the Las Vegas shooting there have been other claims surrounding additional information concerning active shooter related activity, which could support other theories and suspicious activity said to have taken place the same night as the tragic events unfolded at the Route 91 Festival.

            CSC is DHS is law enforcement is Route 91 security and Mandalay security i believe. And SPEER luger 9mm has got to be what they were using that night provided by Obama. Remember the trillions of bullets DHS bought under Obama? Remember the video showing the security guard mag dumping? So while the Saudi's had a shoot out in the Four Seasons that was contained mostly to Four Seasons security went around with automatic rifles and 9mm handguns in the crowd itself and on the streets then attacked the casinos which fits the Australians description of multiple security guard shooters and Brian Hodge was sniping and shooting from the 32 floor after killing Paddock. But what if the plate carrier was Marilou Danley's who is an FBI informant? She is still a suspect and possibly a shooter now. Why she did the shooting too who knows.

            police officers arrived on the floor at 10:17 p.m. and encountered the wounded Campos at 10:18 p.m., who directed the officers to Paddock’s suite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police were not in a hurry to enter Paddock’s suite because the security guard’s arrival had halted the shooting, police implied in previously describing the timeline. Paddock had killed himself by the time officers entered the room, they said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Campos work for CSC or was CSC used exclusively for Route 91?
           </p>
           <p>
            DHS is what Michael Chertoff worked for in the past. Sheldon Aldeson could've worked with him because MGM was his competitor i believe. So they sheep dip Paddock and DHS and Mossad do the shooting because both Adleson and Chertoff or ultra right wing Zionist Jews. So they set up a sting op using Paddock then they kill him and his back up and carry out the shooting. All while Saudi's are blamed or while they're having their coup in Vegas. No need for DHS or Mossad to interfere with the Saudis while they coup carry on or just blame them outright for Vegas and take the heat off of DHS/Mossad. SPEER Luger 9mm was used that night that's a popular brand of law enforcement ammunition. CSC is DHS and they use that type of ammo i would assume. They did something to fuck with Paddock so he would think his cover was blown so he could call Hodge who as unknown to Paddock a Antifa terrorist or blew it so or both so ISIS and Antifa could join the fun because they wanted more fall guys if need be or shooters just in case to cover for them. Bill Gates helped with creating the fake cp emails to throw us off.

            His ownership of a plate carrier is the red flag for you? It wasn't the fact he had a fucking GMAIL (hmm who else used those?) that was centralpark4808 which was literally his address sending hotmail addresses shit like "you gotta try out these bump stocks blah blah blah?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Not the fact that FOIA docs of area 51 literally have summaries they gave to their agents about the history of Las Vegas from dust to metropolis, stating that it was created by the mob, cia, and funded by mormons in order to launder money?
           </p>
           <p>
            So the fact the guy is clearly arms dealing from his gmail and obviously laundering money as a "high roller" doesn't raise a red flag for you, but the plate carrier does?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, Paddock didn't kill anyone. More people would have died though if it wasn't for that meddling Mexican he hired as his muscle. Praise Jesus.

            Lawsuits claim MGM has no liability to Las Vegas shooting victims
Author: Rachel Crosby, Las Vegas Review-Journal (USA)
           </p>
           <p>
            MGM Resorts International has filed federal lawsuits against more than 1,000 Las Vegas mass shooting victims in an effort to avoid liability.  The company, which owns Mandalay Bay and the Route 91 Harvest festival venue, argues that it cannot be held liable for Oct. 1 deaths, injuries or other damages, adding that any claims against MGM parties “must be dismissed,” according to complaints filed Friday in Nevada and California...The company cites a 2002 federal act that extends liability protection to any company that uses “anti-terrorism” technology or services that can “help prevent and respond to mass violence.”...[T]he company argues, the security vendor MGM hired for Route 91, Contemporary Services Corp., was protected from liability because its services had been certified by the Department of Homeland Security for “protecting against and responding to acts of mass injury and destruction.”  The lawsuits argue that this protection also extends to MGM, since MGM hired the security company.  They...ask that a judge decide if the 2002 act is applicable, and if so, determine that future civil lawsuits against the company are not viable...
           </p>
           <p>
            MGM is a Nevada company, so any lawsuits belong in state court, the decision to file the complaints in federal court as a “blatant display of judge shopping” that “quite frankly verges on unethical.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “I’ve never seen a more outrageous thing, where they sue the victims in an effort to find a judge they like,” “It’s just really sad that they would stoop to this level.
“For instance, terrorism is any unlawful act inside the United States that causes “mass destruction, injury or other loss.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI has not called the Las Vegas mass shooting an act of terrorism because the gunman had no clear motive, and the FBI defines terrorism as an act of terror associated with extremist ideologies of a political, religious, social, racial or environmental nature.

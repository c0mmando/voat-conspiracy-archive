             Notice he said as long as he doesn't breath it in it's not going to hurt him. There's a difference between eating it (like fish) vs breathing it vs literally injecting it into your veins. There's also the matter of organomercury vs inorganic, with the former being the most toxic (and used in vaccines). They can't conclusively say it's safe because they don't even know what reactions cause the neurotoxicity in the first place. So of course in snake wording that means there's "no evidence" that it causes brain damage (because they don't know under what conditions it causes brain damage in the first place, they just know that it can).

                 Also, there are many people who live off sea food exclusively, historically. My bet is if you look into it he was literally just eating one or two types of fish every day, Tilapia is the chicken of the sea and very high in mercury content while other types of fish are very low. A lot of health problems in general are caused by lack of variety in diet, like in the US for most people it's basically just beef, chicken, pork. Period. There are civilizations that lived entirely off meat but they were eating a huge variety.

                    In 2004, a widely-cited study found the levels of PCBs,  a potentially carcinogenic chemical, to be ten times higher in farmed fish than in wild-caught fish. That sounds pretty scary, but the amount of PCBs in the farmed fish was still less than 2% of the amount that would be considered dangerous. The differences may also have been exaggerated. Subsequent studies found PCB levels in farmed fish to be similar to those of wild fish.

                    The other contaminant that most people worry about with fish is mercury. The fish that present the biggest concern (swordfish, king mackerel. tilefish, shark, and tuna) are all wild-caught. The most common farm-raised fish (catfish, tilapia, and salmon) all have low or very low mercury levels.

                   Another example is water. If you drink distilled or reverse osmosis water, you're filtering out the minerals which the water saps from your body on the way out. If you're catching rain water you're getting little to no minerals (and drinking whatever is in the atmosphere, which can be good and bad). Then obviously if you're drinking tap water you get minerals but become a gay frog.

                   I think people focus on the wrong thing, like making sure everything is completely perfect in every way, instead of the biggest takeaway, the human body is extremely resilient. So as long as you're not just constantly barraging certain organs of your body non-stop and giving them time to recover, you'll probably be okay. Just like any other defense system.

                   Even then, think about smokers. If you're smoking 2 packs a week, that's about 160 cigarettes a month, 1,920 cigarettes a year, and this is considered very low. a pack a day would be 6,720 a year. The fact that there are any smokers at all that die of old age is absolutely insane when you start crunching the numbers.

               Mostly peer reviewed medical studies. I don't trust academics who choose to draw questionable conclusions from data, I don't trust clickbait tabloids that sensationalize questionable conclusions from data, and I don't trust idiots who link to YouTube videos to draw questionable conclusions from easily digestible science snippets about completely unrelated scientific data.

            Mercury is not used in vaccines.  A preservative that has mercury in the molecule is frequently used as a preservative yes, it's an antibiotic.  Saying vaccines have mercury is like saying salt has sodium.

           <p>
            Eat sodium, you die.  Eat table salt you don't.
Eat mercury you die.  Eat Mercury((o-carboxyphenyl)thio)ethyl sodium salt you don't.

             Has this theory been tested? Is this chemical compound you speak of really safe and has it passed rigorous testing to verify it has no negative impact on the human body? At any level of concentration? even large amounts? What are the characteristic changes when administered to different body weights? I would like to hear more about this testing and how it can prove the compound "safe". I mean really if your going to say that it is safe beyond question it should have been proven already. Right?

               And just because the mercury in thimerosal is part of a larger molecule that acts as a preservative, does not mean it's harmless. There are thimerosal free vaccines, I get them for my pets. Thimerosal is not needed to stabilize a vaccine.

                The first vaccines also didn't have the toxic adjuvants that today's vaccines have.  The original science behind how vaccines work has been discarded and replaced with adjuvant quackery. This is why virtually every breakout is from vaccinated victims.

                 When people seek to reduce their sodium intake, they usually try to limit their salt consumption, because they recognize that salt is a source of sodium.

                The issue is most people are too uneducated to know Sodium is dangerous. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

                 I could say the exact same thing about mercury... especially when it's delivered intravenously by way of vaccine. If I wanted to reduce/avoid mercury consumption, one of the things I would definitely not do is get mercury laced Trojan horse vaccines injected into my bloodstream, even if the mercury in them was part of a larger molecule. Ya know, just to be on the safe side.

                    Six cases of severe mercury poisoning resulting in four deaths were reported following the intramuscular administration of chloramphenicol preserved with thimerosal. A manufacturing error resulted in each vial containing 510 mg of thimerosal instead of 0.51 mg per vial. Extensive tissue necrosis was noted at the site of injection in all patients. Fever, altered mental status, slurred speech, and ataxia were noted.

These reports included the administration of immune globulin (gamma globulin) and hepatitis B immune globulin, choramphenicol formulated with 1000 times the proper dose of thimerosal as a preservative

                    To assess the possible toxicity of thimerosal-containing vaccines (TCVs) among infants, a 2-phased retrospective cohort study was conducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during 1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born during 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks for neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per increase of 12.5 micro g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months of life. In phase I at HMO A, cumulative exposure at 3 months resulted in a significant positive association with tics (relative risk [RR]: 1.89; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-3.38). At HMO B, increased risks of language delay were found for cumulative exposure at 3 months (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01-1.27) and 7 months (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13). In phase II at HMO C, no significant associations were found.

                    We were initially highly skeptical that differences in the concentrations of thimerosal in vaccines would have any effect on the incidence rate of neurodevelopmental disorders after childhood immunization. This study presents the first epidemiologic evidence, based upon tens of millions of doses of vaccine administered in the United States, that associates increasing thimerosal from vaccines with neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, an analysis of the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database showed statistical increases in the incidence rate of autism (relative risk [RR] = 6.0), mental retardation (RR = 6.1), and speech disorders (RR = 2.2) after thimerosal-containing diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines in comparison with thimerosal-free DTaP vaccines. The male/female ratio indicated that autism (17) and speech disorders (2.3) were reported more in males than females after thimerosal-containing DTaP vaccines, whereas mental retardation (1.2) was more evenly reported among male and female vaccine recipients. Controls were employed to determine if biases were present in the data, but none were found. It was determined that overall adverse reactions were reported in similar-aged populations after thimerosal-containing DTaP (2.4 +/- 3.2 years old) and thimerosal-free DTaP (2.1 +/- 2.8 years old) vaccinations. Acute control adverse reactions such as deaths (RR = 1.0), vasculitis (RR = 1.2), seizures (RR = 1.6), ED visits (RR = 1.4), total adverse reactions (RR = 1.4), and gastroenteritis (RR = 1.1) were reported similarly after thimerosal-containing and thimerosal-free DTaP vaccines.

This is what I mean. You don't have the intelligence, the education, or the attitude needed to assess any of this properly. Every second you spent reading this link just made you dumber.

                    I specifically described the LD50 of the chemical. You clearly don't know what that is. LD 50 is the dosage at which anyone exposed to a given chemical has a 50% chance of dying. This is expressed as a dosage per kilogram (2.204 lbs) of body weight.

                    You're exposed to far more toxic things on a daily basis for far more trivial reasons. Example? Capsaicin.
, A.K.A. "That stuff that makes food spicy". With an LD50 of 47.2 mg per kg, it's twice as lethal as thimerosal, and a whopping 1.275x less lethal than cholecalciferol, A.K.A. Vitamin D, whose LD50 is 37mg/kg.  Did any of this worry you on taco night? What about when you were out. In the sun? Do you smoke? Nicotine has an LD50 of 13mg/kg at the highest.

Even minor brain damage still qualifies as harm. An alergic reaction, even if it's just a rash PROVES that thimerosal is in fact
                     <em>
                      harmful

                     Water is essential to life, as is sodium (lol you're such a faggot). Yes, too much water or sodium can be harmful, even lethal, but there is still a wide range of lower doses that are not just safe, but

                     to maintain good health. There is no safe dose of mercury. Mercury is not essential for the maintenance of good health. Even the smallest doses of mercury are harmful, it's just the degree to which they are harmful is also small.

                      Acute or chronic mercury exposure can cause adverse effects during any period of development. Mercury is a highly toxic element; there is no known safe level of exposure. Ideally, neither children nor adults should have any mercury in their bodies because it provides no physiological benefit.

                     Vaccines do not need thimerosal in them. The same companies that put thimerosal in vaccines make versions without thimerosal. I know this from personal experience vaccinating my animals. They're the same price, made by the same companies, and are just as shelf stable. That rash, which is on the

                     to humans in a lot of ways... but they are not humans. This reminds me of when rabbits were used to test hydrogen-cyanide gas chambers, because they were considered similar enough to humans. The rabbits died very quickly, so, all the literature about those gas chambers claimed that using hydrogen cyanide gas would kill a human at a similar rate. This was used to substantiate claims made about the alleged gas chambers used in the "Holocaust". Problem is though, humans are affected by hydrogen-cyanide gas very differently compared to rabbits, and it took much much longer for it to be lethal. Rabbits died within seconds, while humans died after an average of about 9 minutes.

Do you think elemental components in a compound act as they would outside of one? Define "dangerous". What do you think a Tympanostomy is? What do you think the study with the rashes said?

                      Yes. Unless Taco Night and Milk fill you with an unbridled sense of horror, it's safe to say the statement stands. You can't selectively be afraid of thimerosal and also eat peppers, drink milk, and smoke - since the latter three are several times deadlier on their own, and you expose yourself to them in much larger quantities every day. The only way this isn't safe is if you define "safe" as "literally incapable of harming you under any circumstances", in which case nothing is safe.

                        I asked a series of questions. Can you answer them? Do you need me to rephrase them? What is a Tympanostomy? Define "dangerous". Do elements keep their chemical properties in molecules? Like, if I mix sodium and chloride, do I get to keep the explosiveness of sodium in water with the oxidative capabilities of chloride? Help me help you.

                        This is an example of the kind of conversation we can't have because you won't define "dangerous". Why are 50 nanograms of thimerosal dangerous, but the 300+ of capsaicin in peppers perfectly fine? Capsaicin is twice as lethal. You're not actually reading any of this.

             That doesn’t make it any less dangerous. Inorganic and organic mercuric species have their own toxicities, and thiomersal is metabolized into both alkyl species (ethyl, methyl) and inorganic mercury. Mind you, I don’t think mercury is driving autism. Babies don’t metabolize xenobiotics very well, including acetaminophen. The inorganic mercuric(II) chloride produced from thiomersal is a potent inhibitor of phenol sulfotransferases, which babies depend on to detoxify the acetaminophen they’re given as a prophylactic to control the fever. Maybe autism rates are increasing each generation because the children are inheriting under-performing sulfotransferase genes from parents who have been repeatedly exposed to mercuric species and have adapted epigenetic inefficiencies which they passed to their children.

              That may be true, but I'm inclined to believe its due to other factors. For one, the statistics now are based on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and that encompasses a few other disorders that in the past wouldn't have been considered autism like aspbergers and pervasive developmental disorder. In addition, awareness for ASD has grown significantly since the 90's. Back in the 50's and 60's most people would have probably just beaten out of their kids or kept them out of the public eye.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regardless, there does seem to be an increase. My theory though, is that rather than being because of vaccinations or tylenol, its because our infant mortality has fallen so much.
              <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110711/birth-complications-linked-to-autism#1">
               There's a host of factors involving high risk pregnancies that are significantly associated with an increased chance of developing autism.
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd honestly bet my money on the culprit being the fact that infants that would have been nonviable in the past are now surviving through advanced medical practices. Babies that never would have lived to see the light of day are now kept alive and the side effects from these pregnancies cause stunted brain development that result in ASD.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm no doctor though, and I'm not confident enough to say that it cannot be a pharmaceutical issue. Just my two cents.

             But you still suffer the toxic effects of ethyl mercury if you get exposed to a significant enough amount.
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomersal#General_toxicity">
              It's accepted and not controversial that it's toxic to humans.

            </p>
            <p>
             The mainstream idea is that vaccines don't (or didn't) have enough thiomersal to cause any real harm, but logically they would if they contained sufficient amounts. I don't know the actual extent of the harm that the tolerable levels of exposure might cause, I haven't seen any real data other than blog-tier "articles" with spurious citations, and other heavily biased sources. But it seems within the realm of possibility that they might cause more harm than most people think. I'd like to see some real science to actually find out for sure.

             There's plenty of reasons to not trust vaccines.  The fact that they have mercury atoms in them is not one of those reasons.  Pure mercury isn't even that toxic, I posted a video above of a guy swishing it around in his mouth.  People really latch on to mercury though, it's mind-boggling.

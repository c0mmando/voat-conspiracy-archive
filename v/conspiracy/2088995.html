            They were involved either as contractors or that someone wanted us to think they were; but certainly the only person on this earth that could have allowed 9/11 to happen is one person.  And that one person is Dick Cheney.  So let's just get our facts straight here.
           </p>
           <p>
            When looking at 9/11, one must ask 'cui bono'--who benefits?  Obviously Dick Cheney.  This argument about Israel can't stand because they haven't really benefitted from 9/11 but US sure has.  How has Israel benefitted from 9/11.  Enumerate the ways they've benefitted, please
           </p>
           <p>
            Genie Energy in Golan Heights--that's neocon backed...part of PNAC.  Israel benefits somewhat from that because it's location ensures US forces to guard against islamists coming to Israel from the S border of Lebanon and Syria and the northwestern border of Jordan (golan heights area).  OK so that's one benefit of 9/11
           </p>
           <p>
            What else?  They still weren't given nukes.  Oh but the cat is out the bag.  They have nukes.  Illegally.  We found them and they weren't supposed to have them.  Maybe another benefit would be that the US / UN has looked the other way since we found that Israel had been surreptitiously building nukes.  i think it was Colon Powell that let the cat out of the bag on that one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok that's 2 big benefits
           </p>
           <p>
            How about the US?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wow. The benefits to the US government itself are.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             They had a reason to initiate COG plan.  If you dont' know what that is you should google 'continuity of government'
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to approve Patriot Act to delete all citizens rights eventually
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to strengthen the police, military,
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to vastly increase mass surveillance technologies
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to legalize government propaganda in the 2012 NDAA (smith-mundt modernization)
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to strengthen the NSA -- national security act
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to build PRISM and find ways to weaken FOIA and strengthen FISA and
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to enable an active covert militia on US soil called 'private contractor networks' and fusion centers to cull all the data from 17 different spy agencies and police and homeland security to build a disposition profile on every single citizen and use drone and satellites to draw a reticle around each person, ID'ing them from local street cams and facial recognition and track their movements with quantum dots sprayed by chemtrails all over the US and beyond
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to convince you that having gross people fondle you and your loved ones genitals intrusively and aggressively at Airports ....that this was 'for national security' so being molested is patriotic
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to gaslight you into thinking Hillary Clinton shouldn't go to jail for committing vast treasons
            </li>
            <li>
             They were able to gaslight you though the media into thinking Obama isn't a criminal and shouldn't go to jail for treason
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Honestly guys, we still don't really know what's going on, but saying "oh it's Israel" is a statement that doesn't stand up to the rigor of critical analysis.  it doesn't.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can we possibly put an end to the thought terminating cliches of 'It's Israel" and start using a kind of detective rubric to analyze 9/11?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because otherwise we're just going to continue to kick the can down the street for another decade.  In fact, people who just parrot this "it was israel" trope...I strongly suspect they are limited hangouts not unlike those ridiculous people pushing 'flat earth' theory...it's fact free
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know those B-thing / gelatin folks claimed to be mossad but were actually austrian?  Ok so why aren't we looking at austria?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some guys cheering and taking pictures of the WTC are your only evidence.  Did you consider that there were other reasons they were cheering...

            Maybe. It's a plausible speculation. But we still don't have the hard evidence to conclusively prove it.

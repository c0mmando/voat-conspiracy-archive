            Those anons are all larping. They might be right about much of it, but they arent the people they say they are. They come forward with 90% truth and that gives them room to weave in their subtle disinfo.

             The Larp reaction is dismissive, just as closed minded as "That's just a conspiracy theory". This is not the sign of an open mind.

             I mentioned whistle blowers in a higher sense, referring to the Anons (
             <em>
              as well
             </em>
             so in addition), but didn't mention names, see Gary McKinnon, Snowden etc. Others that at first seem less believeable are Corey Goode, the SSP list goes into the dozens. But their claims all tie together.
            </p>

             <strong>
              I agree question everything
             </strong>
             , but what do you see when all these "claims" start building a map, a system that's been controlled for centuries? How does each component fit, does it make you open your mind, does it make you react to say, "no way that's possible!"?

              I'm dismissive of anything I can't verify with a second source. In the same way, I never say something is certainly false until I have two sources that show as much. Until I have some evidence pointing one way or another, speculation is fine, but the info is worthless until supported. That's how investigative work was done until the last decade or three.

             <p>
              Yeah I'm familiar with the quote. And its actually "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought
              <strong>
               without accepting it.
              </strong>
              Which is exactly what I'm doing. I'm entertaining the claims of anon posts, while simultaneously being sure that few (if any) are authentic insiders. I can separate a person from their claims, and one claim from the next, which is why I am able to clearly see the disinfo interwoven into some of these posts.

            "the Frankfurt School’s critical theory, a school of thought focusing on reflective assessment and cultural critique through application of social sciences, as the origin of a “culture industry” that imposes “socially unnecessary constraints of human freedom” and ultimately, the social domination of the individual."

             Oh and there's a reason why Googles Eric Schmidt resigned! He knew they had serious dirt against him. Do not trust Google (results), FB etc...even Twatter censors messages that are pro- Trump. This goes beyond what the White HOUSE might pay those companies for Media Buys. We are well past that. All the scandals are connected, darker than most will believe, and Trump's recent announcements hint at what's on the horizon.

             This is a loaded political term, it's actually a red herring in relation to truth.
             <strong>
              Truth does not care for politics.
             </strong>
             To debunk this concept, we need to look at a political example.

             When Hillary Clinton was debating Trump in their second session, he was accusing her, citing Wikileaks etc. How did she react? She cited 17 intelligence agencies, Russia blah blah. All fabricated, but this drove the Russia storyline across many MSM outlets to today.

             Behind the scenes, HRC also said if he gets elected, they'll all hang from noises.  She didn't know that meeting was being recorded.

             Alt-left, right, none if this matters. It is a public relations strategy, which also serves political operatives and embedded media agents like A.Cooper.

             This term makes listeners think, yeah that makes sense, alt-right, but
             <strong>
              it completely derails most thinking processes from the bigger picture
             </strong>

             What's happening here, why are both Hollywood and politicians like senators and congressmen alike being called out for all these sex

<p>If you take off your MAGA hat and forget about the different sides of the aisle and listen to this objectively, then you will soon come to the same conclusion that i have.  Red and Blue are working together to screw us all.

The house during this time was controlled by the republicans and if you look at all the co-sponsors of this bill (86 of them) it\'s not just democrats.  This was passed unanimously and is now at the senate.  Do you think your republican candidates are going to vote with American\'s interests out?  Evidence clearly shows that they aren\'t.</p>
<hr />
<p>What you are seeing now is called \'Controlled Opposition.  They keep dividing the nation with literal bullshit political games yet, since 2016 (although voter fraud can be traced back much longer than that) who has actually been prosecuted?

<p>Ask yourself, why would Trump remove the Dark Money from having to be reported if he didn\'t want groups like AIPAC and others to literally fund both sides of the aisle this election.</p>

            The initial plan was to take over the republican party and push it farther right.  I'm not sure what happened, either shills took over or people have forgotten.  Now everyone has started blindly acting as guard dogs for the entirety of the republican party.  We're right back at square one with the same bullshit we had before.  The (((left))) and the (((right))) were always too sides of the same coin.  I wish that we could start our own party.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 2 party system always uses each other as a scapegoat too.  "Well it wasn't us it was the republicans", or "It wasn't us it was the democrats".

            You are the player. Please give us enough credit to realize the NWO is on both sides of the aisle. There are some good people left, not many, most all have been bought. Given the choices, Trump is the man. Trump has worked to cleanup both sides of the aisle.

            This is more in line with what I'm thinking.  This just seems like a new spin on the 'more of the same' riff.  This is all too pat, too contrived, and too convenient.  I don't actually believe Soros and Co. are this incompetent.  The Rothchilds wouldn't sacrifice a piece as valuable as Soros this meaninglessly.

           <p>
            They (THE GOP) literally had a "consent decree" that made it to where they couldn't challenge voter fraud. JUST THE GOP - GIVING DEMOCRATS CARTE BLANCHE voter fraud.

             Possible, but doubtful.  They are just slaves bought with money IMO.  They don't realize when they are done destroying their own land, the zionists will turn on them.

            Voter fraud has been an institutional problem since 1913. No one is going to do anything about it. The jews have owned the country for a century.

             without a doubt, however people need to wake the fuck up and realize that this shit is happening on both sides of the aisle and to learn how to critically think for themselves and not let the talmudvision be their controller.

<p>Whatever happened to General Frank Muth?</p>
<p>Frank was responsible for the Office of Program Managment for the Saudi Arabian National Guard or SANG.</p>
<p>We sell the SANG billions of dollars of equipment and training and infrastructure every year. Frank oversees that.</p>
<p>I remember the day someone said: &quot;The deeper One gets to finding out WHO was responsible for this Attack &amp; you can\'t handle if your Own Political Party may be involved, Then there will be A Lot of You that ARE NOT going to Like the Outcome &amp; may stop Looking into finding out the truth.&quot; --\'Scott Binsack\'  (RIP)...
Since then I\'ve seen Many YTubers change topics of their videos and never touched back on Vegas. #WONTSTOP﻿</p>
<p>And Salman was “off the grid” from Sept 29-Oct 4, 2017. His whereabouts unknown.....until now.</p>
<p>We know his brother, KBS was at Nellis late in September for Operation Red Flag.</p>
<p>MBS was at the WH prior to rendezvous with KBS in LV.</p>
<p>Neither political party was responsible well i shouldn\'t say it like that.  A faction of Saudi Royalty that wanted the Bin Salman family out, and their family in, was behind this.  How the two political parties RESPONDED is telling.  The Dems jumped on the bumpstocks, just as Rouse knew they would.  Red herring.  No bumpstock-equipped weapon in 32-135 is linked to any single victim.  The cover-up is to prevent a loss of jobs and revenue at major manufacturers, since the truth becomes a huge political hot potato.  That slows down commerce, which the GOP doesn\'t want.  I understand...</p>
<p>It’s complicated.  In the beginning, they had to keep it hush-hush so they could catch the bad guys, and MBS didn’t want anyone knowing there was an attempt on his life, so the President complied.   If the truth comes out, it will cost the USA jobs, revenue, and progress made overseas.  The President is damned if he tells the truth now - judas’ in his own party like Rand Paul will make it a huge issue.</p>
<p>This had to be a multi-operative attack, not just by air. You proved it yourself by all the headshots. We always knew the Saudi’s planned it because they sold MB just days before. Also, point made...how does someone go from General to recruitment? This says a ton!</p>
<p>Agree.  We showed evidence of gunfire at midnight, operatives at McCarran on the runways, shooters upstairs at the Four Seasons.   This was a mission.  The helicopters were a big part, and the part that allowed us to find the perps.   Ground based operatives everywhere.  Especially upstairs, at the Four Seasons.  Where is all the bodycam footage of the LVMPD clearing the rooms upstairs?</p>',

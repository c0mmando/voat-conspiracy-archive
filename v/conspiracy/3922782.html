<p>The movie is about a future in which nobody can get pregnant, the last child having been born in 2009.</p>
<p>Third-world migrant &quot;refugees&quot; (called &quot;fujis&quot;) have flooded into Europe (sound familiar?), and at some point between the last child being born and the present 2027 time frame England began rounding up and shipping out all the fujis. In the movie, the main fuji character is the one person who is pregnant...</p>
<p>The reason I\'m bringing this up is that a lot of the things in the movie have been coming true (even including the declining birth rates, except for the third world, just like the movie, metaphorically).</p>
<p>The opening scene has news on in the background talking about &quot;day one thousand of the Siege of Seattle&quot; and a homeland security bill being ratified, and even stating that &quot;after 8 years British borders will remain closed&quot;... given that the movie starts on Nov 16, 2027, that\'s only a few months shy of 8 years from the date the borders were closed to international travel due to COVID-19, not to mention exactly 8 years after the COVID-19 supposed start date...</p>
<p>Then, there are scenes with newspaper articles taped to the walls, and some of the headlines include &quot;mandatory testing&quot; for fertility, migrants flooding into Europe, Kazakhstan having been nuclear annihilated, calls for Prince Charles to be removed (though it\'s weirdly worded), government bombing militias in the US, including in Montana, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a scene about half way through where a 49 year old lady who used to be a midwife back during the birth crisis is telling the story of how it went down to the main character (Theo).</p>
<p>Here are the key facts she states:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was <strong>31</strong>, midwife at <strong>John Ratcliffe</strong>[1]</li>
<li><strong>3</strong> miscarried in <strong>1 week</strong></li>
<li>others were in their <strong>5th</strong> and <strong>6th</strong> <strong>month</strong></li>
<li>manged to save <strong>2</strong> of the poor babies</li>
<li>next week <strong>5</strong> more miscarried</li>
<li>then they <strong>started</strong> miscarrying <strong>earlier</strong></li>
<li>remembered booking a woman and noticing that the page <strong>7 months</strong> ahead was <strong>completely blank</strong>, <strong>not a single name</strong></li>
<li>friend at <strong>Queen Charlotte\'s</strong>[2] and she had no new pregnancies either</li>

            Very interesting, and yes, I've always had this feeling that this movie was meant to "tell someone, something".
           </p>
           <p>
            Unrelated to the content of the movie, just a note about the fat ugly black woman... my God... I feel that some black women who are hired as actress's are done so to win some competition, who can hire the ugliest fattest dumbest most insulting to the senses black women, amongst the execs....  even to this day I am able to remember the anger I felt when fist watching it hehe.

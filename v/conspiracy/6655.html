            Whoaverse does have a feature where you have to sometime to make another post. This will prevent repeated posts from the same account.

            I look forward to seeing how different this place will be from the old site, especially the kind of content that is shared while it grows.

             The time delay is a good idea. I fully support it! Maybe add an extra bit in the code --- if you submit 3 stories in a row it increases the wait time. 4  submissions makes you wait even longer. Anything to slow down the trolls.

             I just checked out
             <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/news">
              /v/news
             </a>
             and was blown away. On the old site I didn't bother reading that sub because it was compromised long ago. I was pleasantly surprised to see
             <em>
              actual
             </em>
             news appearing on Whoaverse!

             If that feature could be suspended after a 'probationary' period I would be grateful, I thought I'd put a couple of links up to get this sub moving and was a bit shocked to be rebuffed TBH, obviously I'm a noob here myself right now though, we all are. I wonder how many actual users there were before the exodus too, they must have felt exclusive to have a private 'reddit'.

            Notice the second definition of holocaust as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            It says " a Jewish offering that is burnt completely upon an alter"
           </p>
           <p>
            Very telling of the true nature of said holocaust. I would bet the mention of the word coincides with the land grabs of the newly formed Israeli state. As Israel has grown significantly since its inception.

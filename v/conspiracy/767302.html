            Most SJW types think they are on the right side.  They believe they are doing good.  They are unaware they are actually being manipulated.  A lot of this started via communism vs capitalism.  Russia vs the USA.  Marxist communists infiltrated the USA during the 'revolution' with woman's rights and civil rights movements.  The communists infiltrated these movements and kept their affiliation with communism a secret. They also infiltrated schools in order to teach and 'educate' future followers of theirs.
           </p>
           <p>
            They spread the 'red scare' line to make people believe they were the victims (a common tactic of theirs as I'm sure you have seen) of a massive witch hunt.  All the while the infiltration was actually happening.  What you see today is many different factions of this.  Some who know and admit they are communists/marxists and those who are still unaware that they are doing the bidding of marxists.

            Look at McCarthy videos on youtube and see how real it was.

            </a>
            (also see how they are all for occupying spaces yet when others do it IE Oregon those people are nuts and terrorists.  They say "Our peaceful protesters were pulled from the crowd and thrown in jail... so when people defend themselves while protesting to avoid the "being pepper sprayed and grabbed from the crowd" all of a sudden they aren't peaceful protesters?  ).  Obviously the right to protest is fine but the right to protect yourself via the right to bear arms is insane while protesting.  Fuck Gandhi.  All that fucker did was get his people hurt.  Can you say sadomasochist?

            Now what does all this have to do with SJW's?  Well their ideologies are in-line with Marxism.  You ask any of them and they hate capitalism.  They hate families.  They are against the 'patriarchy'. They want to see USA destroyed by any means.  They play the victim.  They lie and create fake narratives.  Feminism isn't even about woman.  It's about destroying families and taking down capitalism.  Some know it and others don't.  Those that go along with it were call "dupes" back in the "red scare".  And it's fitting that these people be called "dupes" today.  Although "dupes" has changed to "useful idiots".  It's all the same.

            I think there are a few at the top being led but not with truth nor were they chosen or planted, theirbeing given leading information used to direct them I think.

            It's not direct control but influence from a more organized cabal that is protected by certain taboos in our current culture.

            It could be the crazy goes in cycles...we just happen to be somewhere near peak crazy? I'm going to compare it to the great peanut scare of the early 2000's. Seemed like every kid had a peanut allergy. They'd shut down classrooms and evacuate school buses because of errant peanuts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that I think about it, it could also be that that particular crazy has just become the norm. Just like medicating the f*** out of kids has also become the norm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, from my experience, SJW seems to have its roots in the PC (politically correct) movement that sprang up when I was in grade school. People talked about being PC or not PC. We would also joke about how we would eventually not be able to say anything straight because everything would become "un-PC". I guess those jokes have now become this reality.

            I don't see the SJWs as an army being controlled by a shadowy figure.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're more like wind up toy robots that have just been wound up and let go.

           <p>
            The phenomenon is more like a phase of a very long-term plan by &lt;redacted&gt; to destroy western civilisation. At least in my country, education and higher education has been controlled exclusively by socialists and communists for at least 50 years, and this is the fruition of this part of the plan.
           </p>

            Useful idiots who will usher in a new global, ostensibly socialist order with a ruling elite who will secure eternal wealth and power for their families.

             The SJWs are indeed the Frankensteinian monster of Fabianism, an end-times Golem of Prague that will strike the ultimate demoralizing, self-defeating blow against its own people, facilitating the ascendancy of an infinitely more spiritually potent Islam, which our treacherous oligarchs wrongly calculate can be kept on a tight enough leash for their continued empowerment.

             Definitely not a group controlled by some shadow figure. This is more of a mass hystaria, everyone trying to hard to fit in going along with each other. The seeds have indeed been planted by globalist jews and these kids are just brainwashed peons that can't think for themselves. Our youth are corrupted in school, at home in front of the tv, and by adds that now plague every corner of our lives.

             It's sad that the youth can't see through the bullshit they have been fed by the zionist kikes seeking to make western civilization and whites go extinct.

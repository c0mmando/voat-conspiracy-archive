<blockquote>
<p>In a paper released today [Oct 23, 2019] in <em>Addiction,</em> researchers from 41 international institutions released their findings after <strong>analysing sewage samples from 60 million people</strong> between 2011 and 2017, the largest wastewater-based study undertaken in the world.</p>
<p>Researchers mapped the global use of four illicit drugs in their study -- amphetamine, methamphetamine (also known as \'ice\'), ecstasy and cocaine -- but the first three years were confined to European cities while from 2014 onwards, <strong>cities in Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, Martinique, Canada, the US, South Korea and Israel were monitored.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The results:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From 2011-2017, <strong>cocaine</strong> levels were highest in London, Bristol, Amsterdam, Zurich. Geneva, St Gallen and Antwerp, with levels of between 600-900 mg/1000 people per day recorded. Overall, cocaine use increased by nearly 13 per cent over five years.</li>
<li><strong>Amphetamine</strong> loads were highest in Belgium, The Netherlands, and across northern European countries, including Swedish cities and Reykjavik in Iceland.</li>
<li>The amount of <strong>methamphetamine (ice)</strong> excreted in Australasia and North America was huge, far exceeding levels in eastern Europe, which was at the time still considered high with average levels more than 150 mg/1000 people per day.</li>
<li>The Netherlands recorded the highest mass loads of <strong>ecstasy</strong> over the seven years of the study, although increases were also reported in cities like Helsinki, Oslo, Amsterdam, Brussels and Barcelona.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cities with the highest overall drug levels in Europe include Antwerp, Amsterdam, Zurich, London and Barcelona, while at the other end of the scale, cities in Greece, Portugal, Finland, Poland and Sweden have the lowest rates of drug use.</p>
<p>Outside Europe, Medellin (Colombia), Adelaide and the US city of Seattle all recorded relatively high drug levels, although Medellin\'s figures were mainly due to cocaine while Adelaide and Seattle have very high levels of methamphetamine.</p>
<p>It\'s important we determine the scale of the illicit drug market so that countries can work out the best way to tackle a $100 billion industry, which is contributing to the global burden of disease and affecting the economic development of many countries.</p>

<p>Another article points out this is an emerging field that will continue to expand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-international-drug-wastewater.html">https://www.medicalxpress.com/news/2019-10-international-drug-wastewater.html</a></p>
<p>Wastewater-based epidemiology [WBE] is a rapidly developing scientific discipline with the potential for monitoring close to real-time, population-level trends in illicit drug use.</p>
<p>The expertise developed was also instrumental in designing and conducting the pilot project that Statistics Canada started in March 2018 on the monitoring of drug consumption through wastewater analysis in order to collect additional data in the context of the legalization of cannabis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Study Conclusions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the largest WBE study ever performed in terms of cities (120) and countries (37) involved and of the monitoring duration (2011–17). The extensive data set obtained for cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDMA showed a comprehensive picture of spatial and temporal trends of use.</p>
<p>Despite the limitation of monitoring few cities per country and comparing results with national statistics, the broader WBE picture corresponds to the epidemiological indicators considered, e.g. prevalence data and seizures statistics, demonstrating the capability of WBE to be used as an additional and complementary indicator of drug use.</p>
<p>WBE provides updated and objective estimates of drug use and allows identifying and highlighting new trends and specific profiles of use much earlier than other epidemiological indicators. <strong>WBE can serve as an extremely flexible tool for application at different spatial and temporal scales and can indicate mitigation measures nearly in real time.</strong> Thus, merging WBE results with information from other epidemiological indicators can improve our understanding of the drug use scenario.</p>

<p>Should governments be spying on our sewage?</p>
<p>This field of research is currently expanding. How far will they take it?</p>
<p>Are the science-fiction depictions of our toilets analyzing our waste that far off? Where will that information be sent?</p>

           Though there is clearly data from the US, the support/funding for the US portion is absent in the acknowledgments, as far as I can tell.

           Should governments be spying on our sewage?

           This field of research is currently expanding. How far will they take it?

           Are the science-fiction depictions of our toilets analyzing our waste that far off? Where will that information be sent?

            I'll be sending my daily colostomy bag (properly sealed, of course) to them as soon as I get a good address.  US Postal Service "Small Box - Express Rate" is only $6.25.  I am, however, going to start a Go Fund Me campaign to pay for the postage.  The VA already sends me new bags every month (handy box of 50) so I have extras.

<p>They probably haven\'t spent enough time <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/4chan/2189595">getting people to swallow the lie that Christianity is a Jewish plot</a>, but the Muslim-controlled UN condemning Trump has created a sense of urgency to move on to the next phase of programming you.</p>
<p>Some people from <a href="https://voat.co/v/realProtectVoat">/v/realProtectVoat</a> have asked, &quot;Why did <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/988989/4954597">SRS drive Amalek off the site</a> at the same time they were attracting white nationalists here?&quot; The Overton window explains this. What we know about Amalek (besides that he\'s from Quebec) is, 1) He hates Trump, 2) Every time someone would tell him the people censoring him are SRS and they\'re the ones he should attack, he would say &quot;No no, I like those guys fine.&quot; So we have to wonder, why would SRS create <a href="https://voat.co/v/Amalek">/v/Amalek</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/AmalekLeaves">/v/AmalekLeaves</a> to witch-hunt users that oppose them as &quot;Amalek alts&quot; at the same time they were banning Reddit communities to herd anti-Semites here (hoping it would attract Stormfront here)?</p>
<p>My theory is, Amalek is a loose cannon. He wanted to move the Overton window too far too fast: &quot;Hate Jews and Hate Trump&quot;. SRS knows the invisible hand has to move slower than that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Hate Muslims&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Maybe hate Jews?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time the userbase becomes aware that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SoapBoxBanHammer">/r/SoapBoxBanHammer</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/SoapBoxBanHammer">/v/SoapBoxBanHammer</a> is SRS, create new alts and replace the existing userbase with waves of banned reddit communities. With every mass exodus, level up the hundreds of new SRS alts in 
<a href="https://voat.co/v/Introductions">/v/Introductions</a> pretending those alts are part of the latest Reddit exodus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Hate Jews&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Jews are pedos and Catholics are crypto-Jew pedos, hate Catholics&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Christians are crypto-Jews, hate Christians&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Muslims hate Jews and (((Christians))), love Muslims <strong>(current phase)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Trump hates Muslims and loves Christians and Jews, Hate Trump&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The Left loves Muslims and hates Trump, be a Leftist&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The other unresolved question is, why would Amalek give up on Voat right when it became white nationalist? He was already cool with them, perhaps they let him in on the plan and he just .... became some SRS alt? Now that he has nothing to be angry about, nobody would recognize it\'s him. Either that or they permabanned his IP because he\'s a loose cannon. He\'s definitely a liability for them, because his persecution is proof that all the SRS alts are LARPing as anti-Semites; that\'s why they all incessantly repeat the lie that he was really Jewish, banking on the fact that they can wipe the collective memory of Voat whenever they feel like it.</p>',

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabara">
                 Gabara (the SRS ringleader) is an Israeli city from the Talmud

                 Jews were "martyred"

                 it means "The Godfather" in Arabic
                </a>
                . (You can copy the Arabic from the Wiki article and see it's the same as I linked). But now they they've struck pre-emptively, they can say we were "just copying them".

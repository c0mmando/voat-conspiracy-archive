Blue heart is also a medical thing weirdly, or not weirdly the same search yeilds the whole sciencia stem cell heart transplant and cloning organ medicine. especially when you add the word Tolerance, now that there is a whole social tolerance movement. 
I was not relating the baby hope story or imagery to the heart progress or social heart progress pedophile movement. I saw something that i thought was a coincidence and could still just be that. The baby Hope story is that he was drifting alone in the streets abandoned by family because they thought he was a witch. That is pretty creepy. So once I heard the witch thing I saw that the floor he is standing on in the picture where he is fatter. Has stars and moon. Thats kinda culty, so looking at the floor a rocket, thats normal, NASA everywhere, but the upside down horseshoe got my attention. everything else is rightside up and if its one of those cushy floors that kids can put together themselves there would be one or two out of place. But no, so it just rtemended me of the Heart Progress website and what they call theyre new logo. what if its not new? Baby hope.</p>

My grandfather was outside his back yard Thursday morning feeding his dogs when he just so happened to cast his gaze to the sky. There, he claims to have seen a perfectly rectangular, perfectly homogeneously solid cloud with rounded edges. The way he described it he kind of just stood and looked at it for a bit, thinking it stage-- of course not strange enought to warrant more than a moments admiration. Suddenly, from this cloud rose a "Ball of plasma of some kind" to which my grandfather first equated to it being the moon.

            I'll wait on the picture before I enter wild speculation. Clarify for me though, why do you say it's not ball lightning? Lightning has various causes, and it really only needs an electric differential in order to happen. I've heard it suggested that ball lightning is a phenomenon caused exclusively by high power radio waves, so I'd look into that broadcasting station you mentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            HAARP (as another user has already mentioned) has been said to be associated with orbs, but I've heard that a large HAM radio station is enough to cause an orb if the conditions are met.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the weird cloud, it is possible that a normal cloud was hitting into a warm/cold front, causing a seemingly flat edge. It seems unlikely that this could explain more than one side of the shape though, so who knows.

             We have watched numerous videos of it. My grandpa says it doesn't share the same properties, as the ball he saw was
             <em>
              perfectly
             </em>
             spherical and completely dissipated in about 4 seconds time with the entire cloud itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             It could still be ball lighting, but we can't find any videos that match it yet.

            Sounds like a HAARP field if your Grandad is saying there is a micro/radiowave plant nearby.

            Also found some evidence of a weather experiment that took place back in the December of '98 in Arizona.

             When I looked at that HAARP locations map I couldn't shake the feeling that I have seen something similar to that,so I googled it and in doing so I found this "map" of Earth chakra points. I'm not big on the whole spirituality mumbo jumbo, but some of those points being similar can't just be a coincidence

              Good find.  Interesting - I think it might correlate with Earth's major ley points as well.  And something in common with all these areas; they are all situated over significant, deep mineral and precious metal deposits.

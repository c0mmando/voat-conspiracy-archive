             The original algorithm allowed users to block annoying users, which made you invisible to those you blocked. The most logic way is the fastest and easiests way. This algorithm was implememnted in all the social networks. Now instead of this they are using moderators who decide who can post.

              Did they make your posts invisible to the blocked, or simply you weren't shown posts by those users?
             </p>
             <p>
              Back on the old forums in the mid to late 90's (about.com, Prodigy boards, Delphi, etc.) it was the latter.  You had a stalker, you'd block them, and you'd never see a post they made, nor any comments they made to you.

               No, this is the wrong way. It must be vice-versa. The correct way is when you block somebody, they can't see you, but you are free to see anybody you want who is not blocking you. You also can choose additionally to not see posters, if you find them annoying. It's just a matter of logic chain of cause - effect.

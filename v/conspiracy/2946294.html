<p>Okay. So let\'s recap. Fiona Barnett claims a 13 year old Nicole Kidman witnessed her being raped in a satanic ceremony by Kidman\'s father. Taylor Swift bears an uncanny resemblance to 90s era Nicole Kidman. Taylor Swift also bears a striking resemblance to Zeena Lavey, a former high priestess in the church of satan. </p>
<p>What else could support this theory? </p>
<p>TS uses serpent imagery in her performances. She is obsessed with the number 13, it\'s in her Twitter handle <a href="https://voat.co/u/taylorswift13">@taylorswift13</a>, she always requests to sit in the number 13th seat at awards shows, and more. There are also 13 bloodlines of the illuminati. </p>
<p>Kidman has been a constant presence in TS\'s life. Both are linked to Tennesee. TS reportedble got teary about Kidman\'s new baby. Maybe because they\'re related?</p>
<p>Could Taylor Swift be Nicole Kidmans daughtor? </p>
<p>The cloning theory. It\'s possible TS is a clone of Kidman. It\'s also possible both Kidman and TS are related to Zeena Lavey the high priestess of the church or satan. It\'s possible they are both clones of Zeena too. </p>

           What else could support this theory?
          </p>
          <p>
           TS uses serpent imagery in her performances. She is obsessed with the number 13, it's in her Twitter handle
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/taylorswift13">
            @taylorswift13
           </a>
           , she always requests to sit in the number 13th seat at awards shows, and more. There are also 13 bloodlines of the illuminati.
          </p>
          <p>
           Kidman has been a constant presence in TS's life. Both are linked to Tennesee. TS reportedble got teary about Kidman's new baby. Maybe because they're related?
          </p>
          <p>
           Could Taylor Swift be Nicole Kidmans daughtor?
          </p>
          <p>
           The cloning theory. It's possible TS is a clone of Kidman. It's also possible both Kidman and TS are related to Zeena Lavey the high priestess of the church or satan. It's possible they are both clones of Zeena too.

            I believe there is extensive social management and engineering, but celebrities and show business are a minor side of it.  It infringes on their lives and they are aware of it whereas most people are unconscious of athis.  Some might try exploit knowledge of this hidden culture for selfish purposes but realistically they're in no position to participate in a substantial way.  Especially women.

            I see a resemblance. Not saying cloning doesn't happen, I'm just not seeing it here. I looked hard, so many subtle variations in face shape, nose shape, head shape,eye shape. Everything is extremely close, but different in all of these categories, I wouldn't doubt they're related! Just my opinion, don't beat me up over it!

             I just got through watching an entire concert on Netflix where she's wearing a leotard. (Granted is was fucking my girlfriend at the time so wasn't paying a lot of attention) She is very close to being in perfect shape. You have lost your damn mind saying she is fat. I'm extremely picky when it comes to weight dude. She is nowhere near fat at all. Not even close.... Here's a picture from that show...

              She probably wears that robe because she is fat, I mean look at her. She is getting a bit of a thing below her chin too. Its what you probably get by being such a cat lady, although more grandiose, later in life. Its quite natural really. Fatty fat Taylor.

               She changed outfits almost every song . And this is the only one she was wearing a robe... Again I'm extremely picky dude, and I prefer super thin over a little chunk.. and she looks pretty close to perfect.. so again you've lost your mind.

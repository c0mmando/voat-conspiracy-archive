            Considering the recent propaganda pushes we've seen this year, I'd say the Wall issue serves additional functions:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Distraction is the most obvious, it's all the news outlets will cover, at least until they can frame a white for another "Jazmine"
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Trump continues to act like a dumb kid, which will make it more obvious that (A) all who defend his behavior are too far gone to reason with, and (B) the Left can suck on a new bone at the drop of a hat
           </p>
           <p>
            3) The wall will never be built, it's just a slogan to keep his supporters salivating. Like "Lock her Up", except in that case, he could
            <em>
             lock her up
            </em>
            at any given moment considering we have a recording of her admitting to deleting classified emails, which in itself is enough to arrest her.
           </p>
           <p>
            He just doesn't because he's been bed with her since the beginning

            Israel is the 5th column. You don't immediately go after them without proper readiness, backup, etc.. I am not utterly and 100% convinced of this, so we'll see.

            Clinton and company are still protected by whatever is left of the deep state at this point. Also, they "supposedly" allow high-ranking people (essentially 21 centry monarchy) to go out with their reputation and what not intact. Not sure why - especially for war-criminal level murderous satanics.

           <p>
            As for Syria, Trump signed and Mattis delivered. Fuck the Zog Bolton - he works for Bibi and will  be outed soon anyways.

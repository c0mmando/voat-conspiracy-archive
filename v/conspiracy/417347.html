            OK, I'll bite.  1, 2 and 10 aren't proof of anything including harm or can harm (italicized).  They forgot '11. GMOs found in the stomachs of those who eat them.' 5, 6 and 7 focus on glyphosate (roundup) and presumably roundup ready crops (italics).  Remember these crops don't contain glyphosate, they are simply immune to them, so glyphosate should be compared to other pesticides and herbicides that are similarly sprayed on crops, for human harm/benefit, etc.  Anyway, point 6 is bullshit and is cited as such, referring to another scare story on frog development inhibition.  Unclear what paper they are referring to, maybe this one (

            , came out same time). 5 is a single study in Thailand and aims to show that glyphosate is an estrogen mimetic, looking at google scholar citations of that article (it only has 45) shows that this is the poster child for this community but has no replication and few if any other studies in cancer. For 7, the paper cited is interesting and discusses suppression of Cytochrome P450 response, but has little to do with neurodegenerative diseases.  P450's are associated with everything.  There is a hypothesis that obviously comes out of this and that is that Glyphosate would change the PK drug response profile in any organism that takes them.  Has anyone tested this, it's a simple experiment? (I'm guessing no or yes and no effect) 8 is bunk because these writers can't tell the difference between cause and effect.  I study chronically sick humans and most everything we look at is out of whack.  9 is another interesting study, but it links a mixture of different GMOs to the pigs, not a single GMO.  Not at all clear what the cause is, whether it is GMO or something else, and no replication in other animals (pigs or otherwise) is cited.  Measuring global phenotypes and associating with them is filled with bad associations, replication is required by a different study, we learned that in humans a long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Overall this a poorly written scare piece with little to no scientific merit or basis.  In my opinion only two papers cited here are mildly interesting (the cyp p450 suppression - although there is no link to any human disease and pig effects to eating mixtures of different GMOs).

             <p>
              The study used blood samples from thirty pregnant women and thirty non-pregnant women. The study also pointed out that the fetus is considered to be highly susceptible to the adverse affects of xenobiotics (foreign chemical substance found within an organism that is not naturally produced.) This is why the study emphasizes that knowing more about GMOs is crucial, because environmental agents could disrupt the biological events that are required to ensure normal growth and development.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the presence
of pesticides-associated genetically modified foods in maternal,
fetal and nonpregnant women’s blood. 3-MPPA and Cry1Ab toxin
are clearly detectable and appear to cross the placenta to the
fetus.

              Look - there is no question that GMOs could theoretically harm people. Again, hypothetically, someone could engineer some plant to produce the botulism toxin protein -- probably bad for humans. There is a great story that could be written about the potential of GMOs to harm. Unfortunately, every single piece of data in this paper is written in such a biased way to be useless, and not one single line in your reply or the paper or those studies, including yours, shows any direct link of harm to humans.  It was written by someone who is not very educated, and unfortunately you fell for it.

              The appropriate solution for GMOs is not useless labels on product packaging because it has no value, it would be ignored because it would be everywhere.  The appropriate solution, in my professional opinion (I'm not a agro scientist, however) is that GMOs should be registered and made available for testing much like NDAs are in the pharmaceutical industry.  Then harmful GMOs can be identified.

               It is not a question of theory lad, they are harming people. If you make a plant immune to weedkiller, the plant still absorbs the weedkiller. If you use that weedkiller to kill the the unripe crop to facilitate harvesting, the weedkiller is doubly absorbed.(this happens) Weeds become immune to weedkiller as well, which leads to increased usage and absorption and ultimately consumption. What part of this do you not understand? Oh, would you like references for all of that? I am pretty sure I remember reading a report on this. Here is a Forbes article to tide you over:
               <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bethhoffman/2013/07/02/gmo-crops-mean-more-herbicide-not-less/">

              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: not to mention, if you make a plant capable of producing a toxin that kills pests, then that toxin is still in the plant when consumed. Do you not think that this will harm the food chain?

               This is the real crux of your being here isn't it. So labels are useless? Are they now? It has no value? Really? It would be ignored because it would be everywhere. Really, I am seeing more and more products that proudly claim non GMO and organic. Wow, I wish I had your analytical brain. What a stupid, stupid argument to make.

               I agree here, All GMO's should be available for independent testing, currently copyright makes that almost impossible.

              <p>
               I think the easiest way to force corporations to do this is to have complete labeling on packaging. This would be relevant even if the product contains a "safe" GMO.

            I completely agree. All foods should be labeled. It doesn't cost any more, and if people want GMO foods, then they should be allowed to consume them. I like yourself, do not want GMO foods and would like all products labeled. Solves the problem.

              Cancer and obesity are such shitty superpowers. So many people already have them. I want something original like making bugs that bite me die horribly so that they regret their decision.

             I like how many of pro-GMO supporters often skip over GMO's effect on plants found in nature. Seeds from GMO plants will eventually reach non-GMO plants and if they have an pesticide in them that could mean deaths of vulnerable species of insects

              Exactly correct. This I do believe is already happening purely because that is what evolution does. Some of the weeds are becoming resistant to herbicides which entails increased usage and contamination of crops. The idea of GMO cross fertilization is also a clear and present danger, with huge potential consequences.

              I personally love how pro GMO lackey's try and say that labeling is irrelevant / expensive / uninformative / unfair etc ad nauseam.

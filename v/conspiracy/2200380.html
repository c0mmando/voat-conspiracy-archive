            The deal-breaker for the Holocaust narrative is the lack of remains. Where are the bodies of the dead? Where are their bones? The Jews have been forced to come up with ridiculous explanations as to why there are no graves, why no piles of bones, why no thick layers of human ash. And despite very misleading videos to the contrary, there is no ash. There are no millions of graves. There are no mountains of bones.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, people died at Auschwitz. People die everywhere they live. The Red Cross kept accurate records of the number who died, and it is (if memory serves) less than 50,000. Of course the Jews claim that the Red Cross records are false -- what else are they going to claim? At Auschwitz the inmates (not just Jews) died of malnutrition, hypothermia, and disease. And maybe a handful of criminals where executed by the Nazis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Auschwitz was a fucking summer camp. The inmates had a swimming pool, a theater, an orchestra, and soccer leagues. They had their own money and their own whorehouse. They had a hospital where the sick and injured were treated. And kept alive. By the Germans.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is truly astonishing that the Jews have so much power that they've been able to sell this mythology and keep it alive in the face of so much clear, indesputable evidence that calls the narrative into question.

             The main factor is the amount of accelerant needed to burn that many bodies for that duration, would have made Germany wealthier than Saudi Arabia.

             Does anyone remember why their Panzer division was ineffective, despite being superior? No fuel to sustain them.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Germany had that much fuel wealth that they could burn that many bodies, they wouldn't have lost the war due to resources.

            They didn't just use crematoriums though. They would also simply pile up the bodies in a field and burn them that way. Or just dump them in mass graves to be disposed of later when they would putridify.

             Oh, for fuck's sake, do you really buy into that Jewish fanwanking? The official narrative of the so-called "Holocaust" is not only absurd, it is unsupported by the laws of physics.

             The (((eyewitness account))) stated that train cars stopped at large furnaces where somehow it would tip over and dump the poor defenseless jews into it.

            <p>
             1) No such large furnaces are found
2) Soot from (((millions))) of vaporized bodies does not wash away over time
3) Bones don't burn easily and would take more time and energy to dispose of per person times a million times six
4) Red Cross in 1970's published the account of people in camps and it was about 300,000 ranging from jewish to gypsy 
5) Another more recent account corroborates the Red Cross finding

              Like I said they didn't just use large furnaces but would resort to piling the bodies up in a pyre and burning them that way and you don't need to dispose of soot or bones since they can be buried themselves or spread out over a large area. There are actually examples of ash getting used as fertilizer in fields close to the death camps and photographs of ash getting distributed via steam shovel. Apparently having a massive glut of bodies to dispose of was an issue that the Germans had to deal at the time. Also, the Germans were pretty active in covering up their crimes both so that there wouldn't be a panic in their victims as they were being executed and so they wouldn't be held to account later. If they had the time the would demolish the gas chambers and crematoriums as well as dispose of any remains they had in mass graves in these same pyres and destroy as much documentation as possible. They would even go so far as to plant trees over the burial sites to further obfuscate the matter. Before sending the remaining prisoners out on death marches or simply killing them as well. Even then there are still loads of examples where they didn't quite finish the process when the camps were liberated but some of the buildings were still left intact or piles of bodies were left over.

              Also, the Red Cross report was taken out of context, which has been backed up themselves, and they were not even in a position to compile statistics about the Holocaust even if they wanted to due to being only allowed to enter a few concentration camps towards the end of the war - also by their own admission. The job of the Red Cross is to help the victims of war not to count the dead. This is just Neo-Nazi propaganda derived from Richard Harwood's "Did Six Million Really Die?" pamphlet that cites evidence that supports his claims such as references to Allied camps for civilians in Egypt which have nothing to do with Nazi concentration camps but ignores anything that contradicts it. And the 300,000 figure is taken out of context since it was only referring to Germans and German Jews, not to the number of people killed in general.

                As tragic as what happened to your great uncle it doesn't have anything to do with the Holocaust. No one is disputing the fact that the Communists weren't as bad if not worse than the Nazis but arguing that greater crimes diminish lesser crimes is a fallacy because after certain point comparisons are no longer relevant. And a lot of this comes down to the ends: The Holocaust was an attempt at the total annihilation of a people.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nazism created death camps, while the camps of the gulag were not specifically intended to kill - even if quickly working people to death, seems to be the design. The communists were more interested in wiping out anyone that would cause them problems rather than who they were. To paraphrase Stalin: "Death solves all problems, no man no problem"

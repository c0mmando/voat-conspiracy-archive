            They are building controlled opposition to attempt to narrow the overton window in their favor and cast actual right leaning folks as radicals.

             Assuming they are fake, what does Twitter gain from verifying fake conservative accounts? I guess they create the accounts, grow the following, then expose them as Russian bots or something.

              I already told you, controlled opposition. They will say the things liberals want conservatives to say, and in pretending to be conservative will sabotage the right by imposing PC faggotry and pro israel kikery and all manner of support for degenerate leftism and sow defeatism, these are meant to be Judas Steers.

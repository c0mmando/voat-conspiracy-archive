            I don't think Hillary is going to win but, if she did she would definitely be a one-term president. I don't think Paul Ryan will be the front-runner though, it'll probably be some unknown. I'm honestly hoping that both parties self-destruct after this election and we see new politically viable parties form as a result. It has to happen and I can forsee about seven different parties: Libertarians, Nationalists, "Green", Democrats, Republicans, Progressives, and Lib-Socialists. The only way that would happen though, is if the oligarchs started fighting against each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Hillary turns about to be a lame duck president that's weak and ineffectual, it could split the wealthy factions support and some interesting things might happen. Hillary isn't a puppet, rather she's her "own" boss that thinks the rules don't apply to her. If given that much power, she'll use it for her own ends, damn the nobles and their whining! She would not be a president, she would act like a Queen with unlimited power. The executive office has been granted so much power at this point that she could very easily circumvent all the checks and balances we've held for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this would be worrisome, except Hillary has proven herself to be completely incompetent. Her age hasn't helped things. She's in bed with the oligarchs but, she's committed only to herself. That's going to create friction...She'll use the various agencies of the federal gov to do her bidding and "punish" the oligarchs that get uppity. Still, this will create a backlash and she may get impeached. Pay attention to who her VP is, as I can see them discarding Hillary if she becomes a gigantic liability.
           </p>
           <p>
            OF course, this is all based on whether or not she gets that far. The race isn't over yet and, for the first time it's not completely under the thumb of the oligarchs, at least not yet. Much like in ancient Rome, there are "new men" running for office, and populism has granted a voice to the forgotten old-guard. This won't avert the tragedy to come but it will hopefully help us to avoid total catastrophe.

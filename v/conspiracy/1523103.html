           The US constantly is getting aggressively attacked by countries like china with spam (including DoS attacks) and vulnerability tests so they can figure out what they can steal. And they've been getting away with it for a very, very long time. Google seems to not have contributed more than Project Shield and even then that's available outside the US. They obviously know what's going on and have thought more about it than any other company has. They've gone full open libtard recently and clearly they want to do harm to what the US stands for...

           Conclusion: they're helping foreign powers, probably actively as well, but certainly at least passively. And there's
           <em>
            A LOT
           </em>
           of damage that can be done passively, trust me.

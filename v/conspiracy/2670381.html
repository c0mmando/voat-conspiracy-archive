            Bin Laden's Killing Was A Political Move?
           </p>
           <p>
            As time goes on, I am starting to think that killing Bin Laden could have been a political move, and that they possibly could have gotten him at anytime. It's a bit suspicious that OBL was always "just one step ahead".
           </p>
           <p>
            Another point: Bin Laden was captured on May 2, 2011, and he accounced his candidacy in Early April 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone else thinking down the same path? Track his network and communications to milk as long as you can, then use his capture to help your next term's campaign.

            What happened to that girl on YouYube with 3 videos accusing sheriff Israel of statutory rape?
posted 5+ years before Parkland..
deleted less than 1 month after Parkland.
 “off-duty tactical squad police officer from another town.” spotted in the woods outside Sandy Hook during Adam Lanza's rampage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just collect all the names of the LEO there at parkland that day. Those who were suspended, punished, fired.
           </p>
           <p>
            David Taylor, Sgt. Jeff Heinrich, and Andrew Medina are more security i don't trust.
           </p>

            Cruz had an aliby that was confirmed by other witnesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was talking to a blonde girl in his Maroon t-shirt when the shooting began.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 witnesses confirmed that.
           </p>
           <p>
            The police barricaded the school 11 minutes before anything even started so don't trust any of them cock fags.
           </p>
           <p>
            the real shootings begins at 2:30 not 2:19. after police set up their perimeter zone around the 1200 &amp; 1300 building. David Hogg even says he first heard shots at 2:30 during his video. He was in the 1300 building hiding. SWAT team also went into that building.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             at around 2:30 PM, a female witness exited her classroom at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School as part of what she believed to be a routine fire drill—the second one of the day.
Around 2:30 pm on Wednesday, just before class dismissal, the fire alarm went off, and shooting began. A law enforcement official told told CBS News it was believed the suspect pulled the fire alarm before the shooting rampage.
I find so many references to 2:30. police claim 2:19 but they are lying.

            Anytime there is a “training exercise” for an event that takes place the day of, its pretty safe to assume it’s probably a false flag.

            Nezar Hamze is a terrorist cop. Very suspicious.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A 2002 article in Florida’s The Ledger makes the case that Broward County is a hotbed for terrorists. Several terror plots have been discovered in the county, mosques are well attended, and then there’s the connection to the 9/11 hijackers
in 2015, the Broward County Sheriff’s Department had added its first Muslim deputy to the force, a move that shocked and worried residents. Appointing Nezar Hamze was none other than Sheriff Scott Israel.

            "&gt;shooting this rifle that I’ve never seen before"
           </p>
           <p>
            Bullpup rifle through and through truly 100% confirmed. It is it's got to be. Find Stacey Lippel ask her if the rifle looked like a M4 or a Tavor 21 and show her a picture of a M4 and a Tavor 21 and see what she says.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kyle says on a video the gunman was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. This is the same time frame as Stacey Lippel seeing fully armored special forces swat paramilitary cock fag.....
           </p>
           <p>
            it was done so professionally - no fucking way it was a crazy teenager who got his 'training' from Battlefield.
           </p>
           <p>
            then you have the fact that there was ton of info about Cruz being a wacko with violent tendencies, FBI new about it and did nothing - almost like they wanted to set him up.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was dubbed an retard by everyone around him and he only had the gun a few day before the shooting. There is no way an retard would have pulled it off that clean. Every other mass shooter has taunted their victims yet the one dubbed an retard didn't. Judging how he spoke about it in his manifesto he definitely would have relished in the slaughter. The shooter did none of this however, every witness testimony has the shooter pulling the fire alarm, throwing smoke grenades into the classrooms and hallway, entering the 3 or so rooms, clearing them, and moving onto the next. The guys knew what they were doing, they'd definitely done it before. Someone with a background in SWAT would definitely be able to do that. A retard with a gun he'd only fired two rounds out of? No way.
           </p>

more FBI lies 
I'd love to know how considering he had no job and his parents were nearly bankrupt by the crushing debt they were stuck in. The kit he brought in would have cost a minimum of 800 bucks, 1500 more than likely.

            There was a video circulating of swat carrying out a large bag-like the kind they use to carry riot/swat gear. the reports from several teachers indicated the shooter was wearing head to toe swat gear with mask, carrying a gun she had never seen before--as in NOT an AR15, at least not a bone stock civilian one--now some evidence which I feel directly disproves Cruz was the gunman, not just the blond who gives him a fucking alibi, FUCKING ALIBI okay! for the entire time shooting was occurring, is the timeline they give, Cruz is alleged to have taken a UBER to the school, with an incredible amount of gear with him, then he has to find a place to gear up, which takes a minimum of 10-15 minutes alone, all while going un-noticed, then he is alleged to have shot 17 people, then DE-GEAR without being touched, seen or heard, then slip out the back door to McPoison for a soda.......the sheriff is owned by DWS/DNC that much we know, the cops carted off a large black bag hastily and attempted to conceal it in the process, escorted it in an unmarked pick up with a swat escort.....all the evidence necessary to take these people down is right there.It was the fucking police doing the shooting and killing.

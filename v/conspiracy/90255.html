What is Gang Stalking</p>
<p>Gang Stalking is a systemic form of control. Many targets start with being harassed in the workplace, via workplace mobbing and bullying. When they change jobs the same thing continues. Gang Stalking is the community portion of this systemic system of control. What will happen to a target is that they will be followed around, tracked and monitored by the Suburban Spies/Snitches. They will seek to harass and find ways to control every aspect of a targets life.</p>
<p>The civilian spies can be parts of community oriented policing programs, but it’s not necessary. Just like with Cointelpro investigations, everyone in the targets life is made a part of the ongoing never ending systemic form of control and harassment. These actions are designed to control the target and to keep them in line. These actions are also designed to destroy the target over years and leave them with no form of support.</p>
<p>This controlled society uses average citizens to accomplish this harassment protocol. Some of these citizens will be parts of Community Based Policing initiatives, many will not. The closest thing to this that we have seen before is McCarthyism, Cointelpro and RED SQUAD programs, that have been around for more than a hundred years.</p>
<p>For the targets of this harassment, gang stalking is experienced as a covert, psychological, emotional and physical attack, that is capable of immobilizing and destroying a target over time. For the state it’s a way to keep the targets in line, control them.</p>
<p>There are now efforts around the world to use something called community based policing. This is more than likely what is playing a large role in gang stalking. “Ruling the community with an iron fist. “Savvy law enforcement types realized that under the community policing rubric, cops, community groups, local companies, private foundations, citizen informants and federal agencies could form alliances without causing public outcry.” Covert Action Quarterly, summer 1997.”

            I don't think you get the point of removing section 230 protection.  Big tech companies cannot survive in a legal environment where they're responsible for all the content that's posted.  Imagine trying to police every Facebook live video stream, every Twitter post, every Youtube video for illegal content-- they can't do it.  If even one little infringing post gets through, they're liable, so they'd have to read and censor every single thing that's said.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the point... it's impossible.  They would have to simply shut down the platforms, which they won't do for obvious profit reasons.  Threatening to remove section 230 protection would force them to stop censoring conservatives (like Nick Fuentes) whose message they don't like, because they would have to demonstrate political neutrality in enforcing their rules.  It's like threatening to nuke North Korea... obviously it wasn't going to happen, but it scared them enough to come to the table and negotiate.

             Does not matter if they cannot police all the content.   They will simply shut down open public content and screen every single submission... selectively allowing each post as they see fit.  It basically puts a very narrow funnel on speech.

             Incorrect.  These fake conservatives are using this narrative to fool Trump supporters into thinking that these 230 exclusions will only be applied to big tech.  The talks being had by Barr remove ALL 230 protections.  Punishing big tech censorship is the cover story.  In actuality they are trying to reighn in everything on the the internet.  Only Big Tech with all the eyeballs can be profitable in that environment.  Social media as we know it (being able to share information without restraints) will be history.

              Section 230 has absolutely nothing to do with your “right” to post somewhere. It does nothing for you. It protects website owners from legal liability for postings by others on said websites.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I create a website that says “no pro-jew content can be posted here,” I GET TO DELETE LITERALLY ANYTHING I WANT, ANY TIME I WANT, FOR ANY REASON THAT I WANT AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME. I can delete all pro-jew content on that website. You do not have any right, whatsoever, to post content I do not want on my own website. Section 230 does NOTHING about this.

               I swear this guy ^^ Tallests_Kill is part of a deeply planned out disinformation campaign.  I was reading some other crap he posted like this.. it's very authoritative, it seems to make logical sense and first glance, but upon critical examination it is 100% backwards wrong and totally diminishes the morally correct stance (Freedom and Justice, etc).
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's examine his post. Classic dis-info techniques. First, his goal is to try to negate the helpful info/warning the OP is offering. He 100% disagrees. No middle ground. Has to use caps-yelling to do it. Associates racism with "our side".  He uses a straw-man argument.. shifting the premise over to "I have the right to delete" therefore "Section 230 does not protect you".  This does not follow because a website owner's ability to delete does not change with or without Section 230 protections. It is the ability to be anonymous on the web that will disappear if website owners become liable for user content.  Do you think they will just claim ownership/liability of your illegal postings?  Or will they cover their own asses, by screwing yours?
              </p>
              <p>
               As it is, Section 230 gives a traditional, logical "common carrier" or "public utility" type status to information service providers.  That is how come you don't sue the telephone company or the post office if someone uses their services to commit a crime.
              </p>
              <p>
               Though crimes would surely be lessened if voters made the government hire extra people to listen in on every phone call and open every letter/package to make sure no crimes were being committed.

               If Tallest_Shil wants to make website owners responsible for content they didn't create, why not the server companies hosting the website, or the ISP, or the electric company causing these offensive electric light signals to assault your eyeballs??  It's an illogical slippery slope with a cost to everyone far outweighing the harm for a few.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact that Smallest_Ski up here doesn't even whimper the slightest concern for our liberties at danger exposes them as a purposeful conniving anti-patriot piece of shit shill, IMHO. No person is that stupid by accident.

You, being an anti-racist paid jewish shill, don’t care about this. You care about your cat videos being associated with your real name. Section 230 has absolutely nothing to do with anonymity.

            This again? Just because it’s owned by a corporation does not give them the right to censor. There is legal precedent set that disallows censorship when you’re basically the only game in town. I forget the details but it’s been posted here a few times. Until an alternative exists that is as far reaching and powerful as YouTube they should not have grounds for censoring anyone they don’t like. What’s next, phone companies and private banks discriminating based on political wrongthink?

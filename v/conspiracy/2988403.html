<p>Also during the 1990s, Russia was ruled by a small group of Judeo-Capitalist oligarchs, these are called the <em>Semibankirschina</em>, which means the seven bankers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semibankirschina</a> </p>

<p><strong>Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, along with Russian oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Anatoly Chubais, and others feared a Communist resurgence in Russia</strong> while witnessing Zyuganov present himself as a kinder, gentler Communist while attending the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1996...</p>
<p>...The oligarchs set aside their differences and held several private meetings in Davos hotel rooms, where they strategized over how to defeat the perceived Zyuganov threat. The result was the &quot;Davos pact&quot;, an agreement between Chubais and the oligarchs that he would lead an anti-Communist campaign against Zuyganov, that they agreed to fund. The subsequent months saw a massive media offensive as &quot;money poured into advertising campaigns, into regional tours, into bribing journalists&quot;, all supported by the oligarchs who owned the major media. <strong>Yeltsin\'s subsequent victory in that election can be traced back to the events that took place in Davos between Chubais and those Russian oligarchs.</strong></p>

<p>They did not even win on the ballot, the election had to be rigged </p>

<p>It has been alleged that Yeltsin may not have legitimately won the 1996 presidential election, but instead employed electoral fraud. Some results, largely from Russia\'s ethnic republics of Tatarstan, Dagestan and Bashkortostan, showed highly unlikely changes in voting patterns between the two rounds of voting. At a meeting with opposition leaders in 2012, then-president Dmitri Medvedev was reported to have said, &quot;There is hardly any doubt who won [that race]. It was not Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin</p>

<p>I guess you could say Russia under Yeltsin was a Democracy, even if the Russian people did not vote for it. </p>

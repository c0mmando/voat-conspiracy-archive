It is said that adrenochrome lengthens one\'s life span.  It is aid that adrenochrome can be used to harness genetic memory.  It found it interesting that the guy who researched &quot;precognition&quot; happened to have the last name of &quot;Dunne&quot;.  Seriously, DUNNE?  Coincidence?</p>
<p>Could adrenochrome in our world be the \'spice\' of Dune?  Could it be that whoever controls the supply of adrenochrome in our world be the one who rules in our world?  Could our politicians, hollywood actors, musicians, judges, police chiefs (in certain districts), and world leaders around the globe be addicted to adrenochrome and this is why they are so willing to submit to the jew who controls the supply of adrenochrome (via their ritual blood sacrifice of goy children)?</p>

<p>If you take spice, your eyes begin to turn a bright blue, and this allows people to know that you are addicted and that you will do anything for them if they have spice to offer and you are in need of it.  Because of this, those who are addicted to spice will often wear contacts to conceal the fact that they can be blackmailed in this way.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most famous scenes is when one of the main characters loses a contact, revealing his blue eye and his spice addiction.  To attempt to hide this fact, he covers one eye with his hand.  Covering one eye?!  Could this be why the &quot;illuminati&quot; puppets cover one eye?  Is it a sign that allows others to know they are in the market for spice and are willing to do anything to get some more?</p>',

            I believe that you are onto something but I think the "spice" is more than just adrenochrome.  It's the whole religion of pedophilia and human sacrifice and demonic posession and black magic.  It will give you power but also make you a slave.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recently watched Twin Peaks also by David Lynch and it was full of the occult religion stuff, spirits and stargates/dimensional portals and aliens etc..  Not to get into it here but it supports the idea that Lynch is putting the occult into fiction.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a movie called Naked Lunch, a Cronenberg adaptation of William Boroughs' novel.  It is incredibly faggy.  However there is a "black meat market" which is incredibly addictive, moreso than heroine ("roach powder").  It comes from a type of centipede, however the movie is always analagyzing humans and bugs.  For example the main character Lee, his original job is an exterminator killing bugs -- basically a mob guy delivering drugs and doing assasinations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people are "human centipedes" which seems to be they are the bloodline satanists.  There are also various intelligence agencies represented by their handlers(typewriters), which control people through sex, love, and blackmail.  And there's the lesbian witches covens who are also dealers in the black meat market (adrenochrome/human sacrifice).
           </p>
           <p>
            When Lee finally gets to the bottom of it, it's Doctor Benmay (obvious Jew) at the top of the period who is basically masquerading and manipulating and controlling all of these disparate forces behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also "Mugwumps", giant bug/aliens who produce their own addictive substances.  These may represent actual aliens/demons, but I think they are supposed to be just various things that people getting addicted to -- gay sex, porn, pulp fiction, techno music, whatever whatever and Doctor Benmay is basically capturing these creative human impulses/"arts" and creating art/porn farms, and studying their affects on human addiction and behaviors so he can learn every which way to addict and control people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The movie is too faggy so I wouldn't recommend watching it, but I just thought I'd point out that it goes along quite well with your idea about black meat = dune spice = adrenochrome, and that the controllers/Jews are using this to create a class of slaves, who do their dirty work.

            I don't buy into the Jew conspiracy other than to say there are people pretending to be Jewish.

            However, the issue over adrenochrome sparked a thought.  What if Epstien was addicted and could not get his fix.  Perhaps he DID kill himself because it drove him crazy.

             I encountered Frank Herbert's Dune sometime in the 1970's SciFi had been in the doldrums since the demise of the 1960's SF pulpies, the loud cover and numerous favorable previews attracted my attention and I bought a copy from the local news stand .. from memory the story was set on a desert planet that resembled Mars, water was a commodity and when counsels were called canny operators filled their portable water flasks at community expense.
            </p>
            <p>
             The inhabitants were made up of adventurers and entrepreneurs who had journeyed there in pursuit of "spice" produced by rail car sized "worms" that somehow glided across the surface of the planet, which navigators aboard interstellar spaceships used to enhance the insight they needed to perform their task. The other group who got there before the "Spice Boom" had constructed wind vanes which collected and condensed water from the atmosphere and stored it in vast underground cisterns.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Dune turned up at around the same time as Edward Elmer "Doc" Smith's

            , like Dune they were presented amid the full glare of publishing publicity with reviews and garish .. both authors efforts gave rise to the term "Space Opera" they were second class at best.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I got about half way thru thru Dune it had started of reasonably well however once the clear concept of giant sandworms, spice and wind vanes had been established the tome degenerated into something resembled political Americana, I skimmed thru a bit more then put it down .. if others saw Jewishism in it it went over my head, though I am not surprised

            I haven't read the book, but Dune is the faggiest goddamned movie I have ever seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            I watched it recently because the recent South Park episode cracked me up and I have been repeating Mr Mackey's version of 'The Spice Melaaaange' in my head for my own amusement, also because it demonstrates the sheer faggotry of the film.

             Everyone man continually looks at eachother lustfully, sometimes as their internal dialogues are playing.

             All the women are she-hags that are a cross between the witch in the OG Dark Crystal and the Skekses. Even the fucking hissing kid what was that thing?
            </li>

             The method of an assassination attempt is to have the Duke draw in the men within lip-touching distance of his face and then bite down hard on something.

             Baron Harkonnen is what every Hollywood director would look like if you shone a light on them and they weren't being kept alive from their venereal diseases. He literally has a little bitchboy he summons, pulls out a plug in his heart and gets off on washing himself in the blood. That creature is the metaphysical embodiment of the ultimate gluttonous pedo-necro-kike. Plagued, quite literally, by his own insatiable lusts.
            </li>
            <li>
             Sting walking around naked out of a steam chamber wearing some fucking v thing on his crotch displaying himself like a fancy little bitch and generally tweaking out throughout the whole movie.

             The main character ends up in the land of blue meth deeep in the desert, where he gets on a giant phallic object - the worm - and teaches all of his cohorts how to ride these giant phallic demons with him gaily. All of them hopped up on The Spiiiceee.
            </li>
            <li>
             Many many man hugs and pining over men, like his reunion with Patrick Stewart and shit.

            Interesting idea. A lot of different angles to take and parallels that might be drawn.
           </p>
           <p>
            The shipper’s guild being addicted to the spice for travel (spice being crucial to the supply chain)... the abilities of the mentat class and the limitations of the vision (youth elixirs a poor substitute for real youth)... how spice in everything in the world, except the imported food the upper class eat (taunting force of evil down to the lowest levels)...
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps I’m pushing the idea to its limits in wondering of meaning in Paul’s assuming his destiny by becoming the Kwisatz Haderach... lots of savior/religious themes for sure. I don’t think he was outright addicted to spice, just that it was in everything and he was affected in as all who taste spice do... but my memory may not serve tho

            Sounds like a reach. I think there are several good interpretations and articles explaining the dynamics mirrored in Dune, but I honestly haven't thought about Dune in a long time. It's an interesting thought.

            Spice comes from the giant sandworms, water, some kind of fungus, and then oxidation / sunlight.  How does that play into the scenario you're putting forth?

             It is more of a loose analogy; something meant for those "in the know" to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not trying to imply that there are giant worms on one of Saturn's moons which can be harvested for spice.  I'm implying that Dune acknowledged there was a highly addictive drug which had a very unusual set of properties, and because of these properties, it could be used to take control over the world, in the exact same manner that spice was used in Dune.
            </p>
            <p>
             Likewise, it seems that adrenochrome has the exact same unusual set of properties (or at least remarkably similar), and that adrenochrome could likewise be used to take control over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             The book, Dune, was then used to disseminate that info to the (((ones))) who needed to know that info (it was disseminated to everyone, obviously, but only particular (((people))) understood the hidden message of Dune).  Then those (((people))) were able to communicate their understanding of that info to each other by covering one eye, just like was done in Dune.

            I've kinda wondered lately if Dune is redpilled or filled with occultist subversive themes. I've heard a lot of contradicting things and can't really pass judgement on it because I haven't read enough into it, nor read the books themselves.

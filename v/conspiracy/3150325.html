            8:56 to 9:05, difficult to see but you can see some of the casings land and on the ground. They don't "disappear" into the air.

             I don’t see the casings land; none of them bounce and you cannot hear them at any point. Having played many video games it’s clear to me that this scene was modeled after a modern FPS.
            </p>
            <p>
             You’re right about the windshield. It would and should have been blown away. Therefore the gun is not a real gun. Therefore it could not eject real spent shell casings. Therefore it could not have killed people especially not at such a ridiculously efficient rate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe you think it’s not wise to take that many conclusions from one astute observation about the windshield. But I remind you of the legal maxim that fraud vitiates everything. If one component of these things is fake, they are likely 100% fake/staged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike the insipid assertion some like to make, it would be infinitely more convenient, safer, wiser, cheaper, and preferable in every way to fake deaths at these events rather than actually carry out a mass murder. The result, a politically motivated false flag effect, is the same in either case with infinitely less risk to the perpetrators.
            </p>
            <p>
             If any one of the observations on the OP list is sound, then the video can be thrown out as evidence of a real shooting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other evidence of a real shooting must be sought and demanded, and undoubtedly would exist in abundance if this were a real shooting.
            </p>
            <p>
             So where is it? What does anyone see surrounding this event and any of its players that tells them it’s a real shooting? I have not been provided anything like this even though I myself have pores over many videos of the families and “victims” and found them lacking in any and all verisimilitude of a three-dimensional, authentic tragedy.

              Thanks Blackguard, however, I CAN see the casings on the ground in your link. Look carefully, they are small and not 100 percent in focus, but they are there. I've shot a lot, I'd suggest you go out, film yourself at a range from a go pro or whatever Tarrent had, and see what it looks like when you have known real rounds popping out. Then compare it. BTW, make sure it's in full sun, my range has covers and it wouldn't be the same.

              If you watched the video like I did, and you are not retarded, you would notice that he does not pick up a mag from the location retards think they saw a planted magazine. He actually picks it up from where you see him drop a mag when he gets knocked over. If you want to stay retarded, that is your prerogative.

             I'm still trying to find the original 16 minute video to link you, but I think it's either on 153news.net or bitchute.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the meantime here's a video of some clips from the "shooting" juxtaposed with footage from a modern FPS (Call of Duty or something). You can really see and appreciate how fake and clearly staged it is in a corny way.

            this is fucking retarded. Get on some meds boi. I don't doubt attacks have been faked, but retards like this make any theory about this lose credibility. "3:05 to 4:20 While driving to the Mosque Brenton Tarrant inexplicably pulls off to the side of the road and waits. He's not doing anything in the car here. You can see his right hand on the steering wheel for most of the time. As a person in red gets within view of his car, Tarrant makes a quick signal to the person with his right hand. This is a, "I'm your guy and I see you" signal. Just as the person in red walks past Tarrant's car, Tarrant continues driving to the Mosque."

             No argument detected. If shootings can be faked, and they are, we must see actual evidence that a real shooting took place, not a video full of CGI effects and rendering glitches. Where's your good evidence of a real shooting? Got any photos or videos you want to share?

              I don't need to make an argument. You have deduced secret hand signals with no evidence to back this up. Further more why in the fuck would they film their "secret" hand signals. I was totally ready to read the whole damn thing but couldnt make it past what I quoted. Keep doing what your doing but you are only hurting your cause imo. I mean I really don't think there's anything I can say to you to change your mind. I'm just trying to make sure other people don't latch on to your shitty ideas.

               They didn't film "secret hand signals." A slight wave or gesture was captured on video which appeared to this author to probably be some kind of stage direction, which would make sense if this were a drill scenario, which it was.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even if you ignore that one detail you are left with a sizable list of specific anomalies such as a "man" missing half of his head because it didn't render properly. You have no response but to dismiss this excellent and thorough critique so you attack me personally -- it's just what shills do, along with concern troll ("make sure other people don't latch onto your shitty ideas") which you are also attempting to do.
              </p>
              <p>
               So where's your evidence of a real shooting? I'm still waiting. If you don't present any, you're admitting that there is none other than this video which I invite anyone who has played a FPS in the past 10 years to carefully watch and tell me with a straight face that it depicts a real shooting event.

                okay i read some more and still see dumb shit "6:20 to 6:26 Tarrant gets out of his car with a large rifle. He turns right and begins walking on a sidewalk to the mosque. Two people are directly in front of him next to a red car and look right at him. Neither person is alarmed or afraid that Tarrant is carrying a gun. We can rule out the possibility that Tarrant wasn't carrying the gun here as you can see the gun barrel in several frames. Thus, the lack of reaction by these two people tell me they are in on the event. When Tarrant reaches the two people by the red car, he takes a right into the mosque courtyard. Note that we have now had FOUR red markers."
               </p>
               <p>
                Again some retarded shit , either it was faked incredibly badly or maybe he was trying to adhere to the plans he set forth before hand. Why the hell would they record shit lke this that stands out?
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe it lends it self to more acceptance of the reality? Some kind of psychological trick? Oh if we put computer graphics in and editing then it will be more accepted. Or maybe if we leave some trails of fakery it will keep the autists busy and just give us more credit that it infact happened. How do you explain it if everything this guy says is true? Ya shit doesn't add up. I watched JFK for the first time the other day and I totally buy JFK was killed in a government coup this shows you how easily I can just buy into something. It just needs to be done correctly.

                Na that 2nd part you say is interesting tho. Ya throw terms at me that don't apply. Its the same tactic the left uses, oh just call him a "troll" he couldn't honestly mean what he says. He must be a glow in the dark cia nigger. Its paranoia like this that makes it difficult to even have a debate or conversation. I'm not a police investigator, nor have any experience with high level analysis. I defer to people with expertise and authority. You are gonna tell me with a straight face you buy into all of this shit yet your not bombing the government or living on a compound some where? This is just like global warming or abortions. These people say its the end of the world, or babies are being killed. If you really felt that way "you" would be blowing up oil refineries, and doing more than mere sign holding at people killing babies. I do well reducing someone's pursuit of truth down to their psychological variables. All I see here is people that don't even believe the things they purport. Its just another instance of tribalism and degrading of basic trust between individuals.

            At around 11:50 when the shooter leaves the mosque, notice how the left wall is all white and clear. Now after he shoots the one girl and goes to approach her watch the same white wall through the gate. There appears to be some sort of bush that was not there before?

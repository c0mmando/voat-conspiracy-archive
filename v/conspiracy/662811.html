            Sodium fluoride (or just fluoride) is a chemical that was a by product of metals processing, such as aluminum and uranium. The companies doing the refining had a shit ton of it. They didn't know what to do with it and storing it was expensive. The EPA and the Forest Service told those manufacturers that if they dumped the stuff in any rivers, oceans, or streams, then the producers would be fined a few thousand dollars per barrel. So instead of paying storage costs, they sold it to city councils around the country "to help people's teeth." There really is a sucker born every minutes, because all these city officials bought the con and instead of paying for storage, the producers got paid by suckers.
           </p>
           <p>
            To sweeten the deal, the fluoride producers sold the shit to toothpaste manufacturers as "a feature." It turns out their claims to help teeth were greatly exaggerated and by the time anyone figured it out, most cities and toothpaste consumers were suffering buyer's remorse, but were too stubborn to change course.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is also true is that same sodium fluoride is the primary ingredient in serotonin re-uptake inhibitors like Prozac and Saran nerve gas. One theory about average IQ shows data that when Iodine and iodized salt was introduced to the general population around the turn of the century, average IQ went up. When Sodium fluoride was introduced in the late 50s it started to decline again. Sodium fluoride appears to induce an inflammatory response in nerve tissue. Well dosed iodine seems alleviate inflammatory response until fluoride is present.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl;dr- drink distilled water only and find alternatives to fluoridated tooth past.

             distilled water is far too acidic (7.0) for your body for chronic exposure.  it's also a "thirsty"  water,  it will chelate a lot of minerals out of your body.  Really not good to drink.
            </p>
            <p>
             your body operates at 7.35-7.45 exclusively.  any higher or lower is acidosis or alkalosis.
            </p>
            <p>
             given the inherent nature of proteins,  our body has been designed alkaline,  but creates acid in everything it does.  From transporting CO2, to lactic acid in the muscles.
            </p>
            <p>
             too acidic requires your body to strip the bones a little to help neutralize the acidity over time.
            </p>
            <p>
             too alkaline doesn't really happen UNLESS you really overdo it. examples of too alkaline are the shakes you get after puking wayyyy too much, or the feeling you get after hyperventilation.  With alkaline water, Your stomach acid gets neutralized a bit,  which then requires a movement of hydronium ions into the stomach to make more acid over time.
            </p>
            <p>
             that's why lemon juice in water is so good for you,  it makes an ash when combined with water,  and is actually alkaline!
            </p>
            <p>
             the absolute best water is gravity filtered tap.  Get a berkey,  or Katadyn that filters everything.  turbidity,  bacteria,  antibiotics,  etc.

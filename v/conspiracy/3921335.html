  'formattedContent' => '<p>One of the greatest mythical frauds in history is that of Albert Einstein, the famous physicist who invented the Theory of Relativity, E=mc² and so many other esoteric things. But this is all fabrication. The claims about Einstein inventing any theory of relativity, or light and photons, or time, are false. Almost every claim – almost everything – attributed to Einstein is simply a lie. Einstein was an inept who contributed nothing original to the field of quantum mechanics, nor any other science. Far from being a competent physicist, he once even flatly denied that the atom could be split and, much later, admitted that the idea of a chain reaction in fissile material “had never occurred to me”.</p>
<p>Einstein was a third-class clerk at the government patent office in Bern, and never progressed beyond this level even with years of experience. By all contemporary reports, Einstein wasn’t even an accomplished mathematician. It has been well documented that much of the mathematical content of Einstein’s so-called theories were well beyond his ability. Walter Isaacson, president of the Aspen Institute, stated that Einstein’s first wife Mileva Marić was a “Serbian physicist who had helped him with (his) math . . .” Other prominent scientists have made the claim that his wife did most of his math for him.</p>
<p>Henri Poincaré was the foremost expert on relativity in the late 19th century and the first person to formally present the theories, having published more than 30 books and over 500 papers on the topics. Extensive documentation exists that Einstein and his associates had studied Poincaré’s theories and mathematics for years, yet when Einstein published his almost wholly-plagiarised versions he made no reference whatever to these other works.</p>
<p>In the accepted historical account, Einstein is credited with having written the correct field equations for general relativity, an enormous falsehood. It is an undisputed fact that David Hilbert sent Einstein a draft of his work (which had already been submitted for publication), containing precisely these equations, evidenced by the existence of a letter from Einstein to Hilbert thanking him for doing so. Yet a few weeks later, Einstein delivered a public speech of Hilbert’s work, claiming full credit for the derivation of Hilbert’s equations. Similarly, E=mc², the famous equation relating mass, energy, and the speed of light, had been published several times by Italian physicist Olinto De Pretto, long before Einstein was suddenly given credit for it. In multiple thorough reviews of scientific literature, prominent scientists have unanimously stated that there is “absolutely nothing to connect Einstein to the derivation of this formula.”</p>
<p>Einstein’s papers, theories, mathematics, documentation, were almost 100% plagiarised from others. He combined the prior published works of several people into one paper and claimed ownership of all of it. His so-called theories were nothing more than a composition encompassing the prior work of men like James Maxwell, Hendrik Lorentz, Joseph Larmor, Olinto De Pretto, Robert Brown, Ludwig Boltzmann, Friedrich Hasenöhrl, and many more.</p>
<p>In a paper he wrote in 1907, in part responding to (already-virulent) accusations of plagiarism, Einstein declared that plagiarism was perfectly acceptable as a form of ethical research, stating “… the nature [of physics is] that what follows has already been partly solved by other authors. I am [therefore] entitled to leave out a thoroughly pedantic survey of the literature…”[6][7][8] In other words, scientists all build on each others’ work, so Einstein could freely compile the work of everyone before him and re-present it as his own, with no obligation to even mention them or their work. His view of ethical science was like building a tower where each person adds one stone and, if I add the last stone, I not only take credit for the entire design and construction of the tower, but I own the building.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most damning evidence was when in 1953 Sir Edmund Whittaker published a very detailed account of the origin and development of all these theories and equations of physics, with extensive reference to the primary sources, documenting beyond doubt that Einstein had no priority in any of it, and clearly stating so. Einstein was alive and well when Whittaker published his book, yet he offered no dispute to the conclusions, no refutation of Whittaker’s claim that he (Einstein) had been irrelevant to the entire process. Einstein made no attempts in his own defense but simply hid in the bushes and refused to make any public comment whatever.[9]</p>
<p>Einstein was almost certainly the greatest fraud and plagiarist in modern science, an unashamed intellectual thief but, according to sources like Wikipedia, this is all just a minor “priority dispute” about who said what first in the realm of relativity physics. These sources misleadingly imply that several people made a discovery independently and more or less simultaneously, and we are simply debating who went public first. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Wikipedia is renowned as being virtually useless as an information source due to widespread ideological bias and censorship.</p>
<p>Einstein was Jewish and had the support of the Jewish-controlled media who conspired to create yet another historical myth. His fame and popularity today, his status as a hero of the scientific world, are due only to decades of a well-planned force-feeding of the Einstein myth to the masses by the media. The propaganda machine simply airbrushed out of the history books all the physicists who formulated these theories, and credited everything to Einstein. Without the extravagant generations-long PR and propaganda campaign, Einstein would have remained in the dustbin of obscurity where he belongs.</p>
<p>There are many Einstein apologists who produce reams of heavily-documented irrelevancies masquerading as proof, items such as a schoolmate who claimed “the flight of his mathematical genius was so high that I could no longer follow.” Many scientists and scientific historians know the truth of all this, and the accurate historical record is readily available, but many appear afraid to speak out for fear of damaging their careers.</p>

            I'm so glad someone posted this, thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            It's strange, I've been thinking of exactly this topic, him being a fraud for the past few days.
           </p>
           <p>
            My first glimpse at him as a big fraud was when reading a book about recovered and discovered 'strange' weapons and technology. from the Nazis, during WW2 and Operation Paperclip.
           </p>
           <p>
            The weapons energy output was much higher, the weapons deadlier, the energy storage devices smallers, etc. Everything that had been based on Nazi science and NOT einstein science, was better. The author didn't hit the nail on the head all the hard about this, but he did mention that the scientists in Germany had been forced to recreate scientific fields/disciplines while ignoring any jewish influence, including new info coming out of America, from einstein. Although he wrote the passage as if it was some punishment or it was holding the scientists back from achievement, either a more detailed reader or someone who already had been thinking of/reading about the trickery of jews, would begin to put together the few pieces given, and amount to the simple fact that thankfully the nazi scientists had not been tainted by the foul science coming out of einsteins ass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh and a few of the theory's that somehow today we accept as 'fact' that came out of einsteins ass, were in response to a previous claim or theory not really making sense, so einstein would just decide on another theory that would strengthen what he had said before. a real trixter.
           </p>
           <p>
            In general, as I've become more and more exposed to so many of the goats's minds/thoughts/ideas/knowledge on this forum, the more i've come to the conclusion that the same as we have come to acknolwedge that water is wet and "never relax around blacks!" the same approach should be given to jews when acknowledging that they can't be trusted and anything in history or currently, that came out of a jew's mouth/hands/ass, should be first doubted till extensively verified, and not be surprised if it can NEVER be verified and eventually the entire theory/idea crumbles to dust.

            Epstein met Albert Einstein at Roughton Heath, Norfolk, in 1933 and had three sittings for a bust. He remembered his meeting with Einstein as, "His glance contained a mixture of the humane, the humorous and the profound. This was a combination which delighted me. He resembled the ageing Rembrandt.

            because they've created a stranglehold on media, and the power of media allows it to dictate reality and our everyday lives, including our thoughts and opinions.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you control every corner of the media you're able to overload the masses with the same lies from every angle, creating a false reality that people eventually have no other choice to believe. That is why kikes try so hard to suppress every independent media source because they're able to spread the truth, and the truth is the jew's worst enemy.

            Can I paraphrase? Einstein was a parable like the Hall of cost and Wakanda. Using a media feedback loop reinforcing the parable until noone can remember the parable is in fact... a parable.

               Easiest way I've come to understand the uncertainty principle is measuring something changes its attributes.  So imagine you want to know the exact air pressure in a tire.  You put your measuring device on it (pressure gauge) and immediately the air pressure in the tire changes ever so slightly because your gauge modified it.  Measuring things changes them.  That's the observer effect in a nutshell.

               I wouldn't say the studying of the quantum world is bullshit, just that our understanding of what it all means is extremely limited.

                I don't like where the come up with an uncertainty princle, like trying to make up a law that says we can not know something, that's a copout, they need to keep working to figure it out. Just use netownian physics.

                 same goes for saying particles "come into existence from absolute nothingness, therefore the big bang and entire universe came from absolute nothingness"
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's retard logic, and it's all they have to back up their materialistic worldviews. At the very least particles aren't coming from nothingness, but rather a realm/dimension/spectrum that we're simply currently unable to detect. It'd be like having a radio and observing music coming from the speakers and just assuming all the sound was produced from nothingness because we can't visibly detect the radiowaves.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Einstein’s papers, theories, mathematics, documentation, were almost 100% plagiarised from others. He combined the prior published works of several people into one paper and claimed ownership of all of it. His so-called theories were nothing more than a composition encompassing the prior work of men like James Maxwell, Hendrik Lorentz, Joseph Larmor, Olinto De Pretto, Robert Brown, Ludwig Boltzmann, Friedrich Hasenöhrl, and many more.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a paper he wrote in 1907, in part responding to (already-virulent) accusations of plagiarism, Einstein declared that plagiarism was perfectly acceptable as a form of ethical research, stating “… the nature [of physics is] that what follows has already been partly solved by other authors. I am [therefore] entitled to leave out a thoroughly pedantic survey of the literature…”[6][7][8] In other words, scientists all build on each others’ work, so Einstein could freely compile the work of everyone before him and re-present it as his own, with no obligation to even mention them or their work. His view of ethical science was like building a tower where each person adds one stone and, if I add the last stone, I not only take credit for the entire design and construction of the tower, but I own the building.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The crap of it is that almost all of this has always been perfectly acceptable in academia - as long as you cite your sources.  You can copy like hell from anywhere, using anything you want, even if your conclusions are just simple additive incremental steps, as long as you document the source you copied from.  And you'll probably get far more credit than you deserve for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            He probably could have done pretty much everything he did exactly the same, plus adding citations, and with the media manipulation coverage he had to smooth it over, he probably would have come out just as well if not better.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the arrogance, greed, and complete lack of care and understanding of the culture he was working in belies what seems to be an inherent nature.  It really should make you stop and think for a minute...

             When asked what it felt like to be a genius, Einstein stated, "Go ask Tesla."  Decorum of that time period prohibited Tesla to provide his real thoughts on Einstein, but he did hint to him being a nothing by stating that he was a theoretical scientist.  Anyone who studies Tesla knows this is a critical observation.

            I’ve read Isaacson’s biography on Einstein. He even admits Einstein’s math was subpar for his field (red flag right there).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, Einstein’s hagiographer—who also is Jewish—is forced by the learned community’s awareness of his pedestrian math skills to tell the truth. However, since the Jewish race is ‘supreme’, he deemphasizes the one skill that’s necessary to thrive in the field.

               Correct. In this case, they are parables and myths. jews teach each other myths as parables. They also need to believe the myth as real.

              Satelites and assteroids are cgi. Go google search sattelites and look at all the cartoons and cgi. Saturn is matte orange and flat when observed through an optical telescope. Its not a space ball.

               CGI on what? Is there a screen in the sky? Saturn looks flat and matte orange because of the distance and the observational device. Go look at something through binoculars; it will appear flat because depth perception is eliminated.
              </p>
              <p>
               Was it CGI when the ancients observed them? Or are you saying those accounts were simply faked?

                The images that NASA produces are fake and CGI. Literally search up any image of a satellite and it's a fake picture using 90's special effects.

                 I've seen their fake images of Earth. I don't think it's because the Earth isn't a sphere, but rather because NASA is an excuse to funnel away taxpayer money without actually exploring space or advancing tech. It's a propaganda firm more or less. They put out a ton of anthropogenic climate change bullshit, for example.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Not sure if all of their images are fake though. I haven't looked closely at the others.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Earth is a sphere, this has been known since antiquity and I can't see any reason for our overlords to lie about it. The Greeks proved its roundness and so have many others. Navigators have been aware of the Earth's sphericality for ages. It
                 <em>
                  feels
                 </em>
                 like a lie though which is strange to me, I can go out to a desert and prove that it's round. I don't think a round Earth undermines its sanctity or the existence of the Divine. I figure that the seals such as the UN flag have less to do with the reality of a flat Earth but rather with their perverse goal of eradicating nations and uniting the globe under a single raceless, borderless, cultureless degenerate folk.

                  Interesting note, ships use plane navigation even to this day. Same for pilots.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Ships "disappearing" under the horizon can be explained by angular resolution and can even be tested at home with a simple experiment. I've done this myself and observed the phenomenon first hand.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Greeks didn't prove the shape of the Earth because that experiment can work exactly the same whether the Earth is flat or round.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The number 1 reason people have such a hard time letting go of the globe Earth theory is because it has been so heavily ingrained into our minds since as young as we could remember. You can't just undo decades of indoctrination overnight

             <p>
              In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the principle that anything having mass has an equivalent amount of energy and vice versa, with these fundamental quantities directly relating to one another by Albert Einstein's famous formula: This formula states that the equivalent energy can be calculated as the mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.

             If you are a good programmer you shouldn't be depending on so many libraries. You certainly didn't write those libraries, so, you wrote the code you wrote and not the code you didn't write.

               You didn't say that. You said your code is 50-75% modules. The answer is no, you didn't write that, it's a pretty simple answer. The same applies to incestuous kid fucker Einstein.

                I'm confused. I write code which utilizes modules - then those modules are 'included' in my code base. The inclusion is in the form of the 3rd party modules and also the constructs and methods used to call the modules. I didn't 'invent' those I simply use protocol/language someone else devised to utilize their module. So I would count that too.

                 You've moved the goal posts. If you included the language as being "something you didn't write but are just using" then you may as well include the operating system and so on. In which case the sum total of your code is nothing close to 25-50% of the project. So that isn't what you were talking about.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You were talking about libraries and modules. If your project is comprised more of other people's code than your own, then most of the project wasn't written by you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You understand that. So I'm losing track of what we're actually talking about.

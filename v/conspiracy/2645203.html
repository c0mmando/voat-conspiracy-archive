            From McGowan's book "Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops and the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream"
           </p>
           <p>
            Zappa, along with certain members of his sizable entourage (the Log
Cabin was run as an early commune, with numerous hangers-on occupying
various rooms in the main house and the guest house, as well
as the peculiar caves and tunnels lacing the grounds of the home; far
from the quaint homestead the name seems to imply, the Log Cabin
was a cavernous five-level home that featured a 2,000+ square-foot
living room with three massive chandeliers and an enormous floor-toceiling
stone fireplace), will also be instrumental in introducing the look
and attitude that will define the ‘hippie’ counterculture—although the
Zappa crew prefers the label ‘freak’. Nevertheless, Zappa will never really
make a secret of the fact that he has nothing but contempt for the
hippie culture that he will help create and with which he will surround
himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given that Zappa is, by various accounts, a pro-military, rigidly authoritarian
control-freak, it is perhaps unsurprising that he will not feel
a kinship with the youth movement that he will help nurture. And it is
probably safe to say that Frank’s dad also would have had little regard
for the youth culture of the 1960s, given that Francis Zappa was, in case
you were wondering, a chemical warfare specialist assigned to—where
else?—the Edgewood Arsenal near Baltimore, Maryland. Edgewood
is, of course, the longtime home of America’s chemical warfare program,
as well as a facility frequently cited as being deeply enmeshed in
MKULTRA operations. Curiously enough, Frank Zappa literally grew up
at the Edgewood Arsenal, having lived the first seven years of his life in
military housing on the grounds of the facility. The family later moved
to Lancaster, California, near Edwards Air Force Base, where Francis
Zappa continued to busy himself doing classified work for the military/
intelligence complex. His son, meanwhile, prepped himself to become
an icon of the peace and love crowd. Again, nothing unusual about that,
I suppose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Making up the other half of Laurel Canyon’s First Family is Frank’s
wife, Gail Zappa, known formerly as Adelaide Sloatman. Gail hails from
a long line of career Naval officers, including her father, who spent his
life working on classified nuclear weapons research for the US Navy.
Gail herself once worked as a secretary for the Office of Naval Research
and Development (she also once told an interviewer that she had
“heard voices all [her] life”). Many years before their nearly simultaneous
arrival in Laurel Canyon, Gail had attended a Naval kindergarten
class with “Mr. Mojo Risin’” himself, Jim Morrison (it is claimed that,
as children, Gail once hit Jim over the head with a hammer). The very
same Jim Morrison had later attended the same Alexandria, Virginia,
high school as two other future Laurel Canyon luminaries—John Phillips
and Cass Elliot.

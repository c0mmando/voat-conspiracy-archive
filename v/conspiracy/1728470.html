<p>Hi! :)</p>
<p>I AM writing a little story for my 5th grade ascension project in school. It is based on a short play called “Riddle Me This --- Said The Joker to The Fool.”</p>
<p>This super fun and scary short story will be posted in 5 parts because the Scariest Stories are Interactive --- Think of this as a Scavenger Hunt and understand that YOU are part of something very special!</p>
<p>Please Enjoy! </p>
<p>:)~</p>
<p>Part 1: &quot;Ancient Aliens --- Just When Did Those Rascals Leave and Where Inside The World Did They Go?”</p>
<p>But First:
Have you ever wondered why so many of our elite politicians, celebrities and religious leaders eat babies? </p>
<p>I have travelled very, very deep my friends and am being compelled to share this message --- I hope you may find value in these gentle rants and musings.</p>
<p>CAUTION: With many apologies, please understand that this &quot;truth&quot; is being framed by this puppet\'s language and experiences and like all truth, is restricted by the capacity of our human form to process information. The true majesty of our reality would quite literally make our little heads explode! :)</p>
<p>In order to fully comprehend the magnitude of what we\'re dealing with, I ask that you please first consider the following clarifying questions. </p>
<p>However, if you are familiar with the work of Hidden Hand or have been &quot;blessed&quot; to read through my earlier rantings, please skip to Part 5 at the end. :)~</p>
<p>It will take approximately 35 minutes to post this entire short story, unless the silent HEREOS (WAKE UP) here are voat would be so cruel as to shadowban a completely harmless and fictional short story based on current events.  
</p>
<p>Or if you would like to jump right into the nitty gritty of &quot;Why the Elite Eat People&quot; --- please read my gentle rants and musings at the following link below. Please Take note, the biggest Secrets are Hidden in the replies Near The End of this thread --- as it is always so important to set the mood. </p>

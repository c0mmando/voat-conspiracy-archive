            I believe the term "God" came into English from the name of a demon Tuetonic tribe of Europe worshipped, as even a good dictionary will tell you.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're dealing with a creation of a matrix to train, test, educate a remnant of those created in the image of Yahweh. This purge of the Earth has been part of that message since it was first placed in the stars for Adam to pass down.
           </p>
           <p>
            So DON'T FORGET THE CONCLUSION ...
           </p>
           <p>
            THE REMNANT WIN THIS.

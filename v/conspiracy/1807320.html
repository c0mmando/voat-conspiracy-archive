            I don't think /pol/ quite understands they are just merely following a time line towards the new world order &amp; ultimately the end of the world as we know it, they have played their role perfectly.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes me sad but the establishment nor does the time line of life care about a couple of people behind a computer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me explain.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, we are talking about deities. Ancient races that were attuned to nano tech &amp; a culture that built the pyramids they can't even figure out today.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they predicted today /pol/ 2000 years ago, do you honestly think they don't know more around other events?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Illuminati Card Game was made in 1990's
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=iACn_sV5Wus">
             It is &amp; has explained events coming up &amp; that have been.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            /pol/ You don't get it do you. I feel sad for you, you tried or believed you were doing the right thing. It is all just going according to plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reality is the establishment have stated themselves, "knowledge is power", you think they don't know more then you &amp; hiding what is to come, hiding text of truth from manuscripts from long ago? Before you were even born, before /pol/ or the internet ever existed?
           </p>
           <p>
            You are merely a step in the time line. &amp;
            <a href="https://mysterybabalon.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/thefroggod.jpg?w=370&amp;h=548">
             your card has been played.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            ..
            <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CekwfI7VL._SX355_.jpg">
             as predicted 2000 years ago
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            before you born or the internet even existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The establishment knows more than you more than you know, but there's one that knows more then them. Get right with him because in the end Heaven &amp; Hell &amp; where your going is all that matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, &amp; love is awesome &amp; life is here to live it. Enjoy it, stop being puppets or better yet do your research before galavanting around the country side speeding up the process of the end of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, live life. The End will happen, you played your part. The End will happen no matter what, whether from a meteor or the push of a button, why worry about such things?
           </p>
           <p>
            Live your life. It's here to be enjoyed. Help people along the way yes, but to think you have "changed" the fabric of a line that was here before you existed &amp; will be after everything turns from dust to dust is foolish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do what you can to help others but

             Matthew 6:23
But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            What you thought was light was merely darkness &amp; a role played &amp; we all know what the establishment is like. Full of Pedo, Satanic Worshiping, Spirit Cooking weirdos.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is, you merely played your part in the role of these people.

              You think you know better? Then try &amp; stop Armageddon.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have 100 years to live on this earth. It's insignificant. The elite have been doing this long before the internet existed. Generation after generation. /pol/ been around how long?
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah, like I said. They played their part. They meant well but it's just a small part of the bigger picture.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll post links to a couple of more things which I'm sure you haven't being paying attention to. Cause while /pol/ is chasing guys with bike locks, the elite are on track to tearing America apart from within &amp; about to destroy the place.
             </p>
             <p>
              They're fighting the wrong enemy. It's like this, people &amp; /pol/ included is trying to pick out a splinter while ignoring the fact their whole other arm is missing.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is what it is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm just passing on the message. Ignore it, I really couldn't care less. But when shit hits the fan &amp; the elite run &amp; hide leaving you all to your fate.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's on you. Sorry.

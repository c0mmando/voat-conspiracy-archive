            i cant change your mind, one day there was an island visible from the US-east coast, an island which is usually covered by the earths curvature. i dont rememebr the exact details, but it was over the news, they explained it by atmospheric phenomena, that the air will refract the light for a day, and make the island visible from overseas. implying that on a normal day the air shows no such light refractions, which it obviously does...
 i cant find any sources, it seems they are scrubbed off the search results. there are also some zoom recordings around where you can clearly see that ships in the distance disappear above the sea level, due to the sea creating a mirage on top of the water at exceeding distance, and the ship drives right into the mirage until it is fully engulfed and becomes invisible to the camera, the sea level on the horizon is actually lower down than it appears to be, what you perceive as the horizon, is the water and its mirage type reflection above it.

             nasa official "photo of the Earth". Now, that image is
             <em>
              perfectly
             </em>
             spherical. Perfect, put the image up in Gimp, and make a circle over it. Perfectly spherical.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, what's your answer to that?

               Eratosthenes' experiment would give the exact same result with a Sun that is ~3k miles away.

                NASA is a fucking idiot there is no misunderstanding between us mate.
I just tell you to not glow like a cianigger, because whatever they hiding, its not something so stupid like flat earth.If you want to have evidence without external evidence to convince you that they are hiding something amazing, and not something stupid like flat earth is a seismologic map of the geoid planet because you can follow the movement of the plates.
The question is not about NASA being full if shit. Its about you please not be so stupid and believe things like flat earth. Just think about it. How can you move the plates if they are on a flat structure?You can follow individual earthquakes transfer energy from individual earthquakes moving around the planet in the plates.Earth is guaranteed not flat.They are hiding either aliens or the fact they cant even send a camera to make a picture that survives the true enviroment of space, or something they do or cant do.

                <p>
                 Lying about the very shape and nature of reality makes every other deception that much easier. These occultists believe they practice magic, summon demons, gain power from killing children, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look how easily people swallow even the boldest of lies. 9/11, Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbour, Iraq (and every other war in the ME), are all easily seen as lies. Why does everyone go along with it? What's the difference between our ancestors, and people of today?

                <p>
                 There was serious debate surrounding helio/geo-centrism right up to the "Moon landing".
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't "advocate flat Earth", I'm am genuinely unsure. I think "infinite plane" is most likely, if the heliocentric model is false.

             Of course the moon landing was faked. They wouldn't let that shit out so that US enemies (Russia during the cold war, etc) could get any useful information.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, while the videos were fake. I don't think the actual landing was. Consider that nowadays we have thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth in space, and they've been up there for quite a while, we definitely have the technology to do so. Add to that, that if any one country actually secures "the moon" and is able to hold it and develop military bases etc. they could have a huge military advantage. With satellites nowadays, every single square meter of the earth is viewable. You couldn't hide something like a nuclear program if you tried.
            </p>
            <p>
             They definitely sent a manned craft of some sort to the moon, and it's not that much of a stretch to say that someone got out and walked around for a bit.

               But here's a question for you. If satellites don't exist. How do you explain how GPS works? I mean, you COULD have them flying around in planes all day and night, but that'd be pretty expensive as opposed to having them in orbit.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for why it's an issue now... it all comes down to funding. There is no military case for - nor money to be made from - landing on the moon any more. Back then, they had to do it because cold war and if the Russians somehow built a weapon on the moon, they needed to make sure they could deal with it. Nowadays, unless China decides to pull a "South China Sea" on The Moon, there just isn't a need to do it again.

                Why does gps stop working in remote locations? Why have you never seen a satellite dish point anywhere other than the horizon? Doesn't matter where I go, coast to coast, the dishes are never pointed up.

               <p>
                Now, if you are telling me you're intelligent enough to have an advanced stem degree, but you also believe nasa put humans on the moon, I'm going to have a difficult time reconciling those things.

                There's no need to go to the Moon? Didn't I read a paper that stated the Moon is covered in H3? If so, you could become very wealthy mining the Moon.

                 Yeah, nah mate. Modern GPS systems do not use LORAN. It's much more expensive; no where near as accurate, especially over large distances; and you can prove it yourself: buy a GPS, and configure it to use LORAN. It won't work that way.

                 Of course not, they're all pointed some-what south towards the equator (in America), right? That's because of geosynchronous orbit. They need to point to a satellite (in space) that is located above the equator. If you go to countries on the equator, they'll point slightly east or west, but not north or south; and if you got to countries south of the equator (like Australia) they'll point north.
                </p>

                <p>
                 That's not how it works. It could be covered in diamond and unobtainium, but but unless you could could bring it back to Earth and sell it for more than it costs to get, you're not going to make any money. It costs around 50k USD / kg to send something into space. Estimate double that for a return journey at minimum, 100k / kg. And now you also need to send the equipment to actually do the "mining" as well, and some way to store the H3 that is robust enough to make it back to earth.

                 The moon landing was most likely real, the video they showed the world is probably faked, the ISS is real.

                  Diagram that. You'd have to point through the Earth, eh?

                 <p>
                  So, it's impossible that gps is just better LORAN? Why? You ever try to use gps deep in the ROcky Mouontains (Canadian ones, not those pussy hills America has)? It doesn't work, son.

                  Ever use a sat phone? How the fuck is that antenna doing anything to help talk to fucking space? Looks like a powered LTE antenna in the Garmin I dissected.

             Nice try.  I came to Voat with the Fat People Hate exodus.  Fat people suck and so does NASA.

            Everyone knows the earth isn't round.  It's an oblate spheroid.  Duh.

             Yeah, but it's fatter below the south pole, more pear shaped, right?

             So why does nasa keep showing us a perfectly spherical planet? Go look at the photos. Measure them. They are certainly not oblate, never mind pear shaped.

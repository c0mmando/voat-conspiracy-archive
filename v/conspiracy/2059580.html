            There is a market for someone to develop a phone app that would be able to detect different frequencies of Direct Energy Weapon attacks. Based upon microwaves and other HF's  this would allow the victim to be able to know if an area was under the presence of a Energy Weapon attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whoever develops this would really need to know their stuff though, and keep anonymous.....

             That's a deep issue and not as easy as "coding an app". The phone has sensors that might be used to detect certain frequencies, some are accesible through low-level to use all its "capability" and others can be coded with just the APIs. The most common way is using the magnetometer, that detects disruptions, like metal, magnets or strong electromagnetic fields, causing a deviation from earth magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p>
             That would assume that the tools can only sniff or analyze within the sensor frequency boundaries (example: If microwaves, then the sensor range, leaving the military ranges out of the equation). Not all physical detectors would work if we don't know what's the frequency range used by the weapon, that is extremely possible that doesn't operates within commercial detector ranges.

              Thanks for your knowledgeable reply. So basically weapons grade microwave weaponry cant be detected (so far) with main street level tech.

<p>Okay,</p>
<h2>I’m just going to be straight up with you. I’m being channelled by a Divine Soul Group Family who call themselves the Jokers and the Fools. Yes Kek’s Soul Group Family!!! Hahaha!!!  :)~ </h2>
<h2>They call themselves this because all they want to do is have fun and be happy. They are loveliest most joyful Soul Group Family you could ever imagine. They are just like cartoon characters and are so fucking funny it’s absurd! </h2>
<h2>They have given me all the secrets to the universe, well some of biggest secrets anyway, that they need us to share with as many people as we can. :)</h2>
<h2>I’m going to post the link to the blog here, because I am prone to rambling. But please note, with many apologies in advance, these secrets are in the form of a Short Story/Riddle --- I guess it’s their thing. Heaven forbid that they could make me seem less crazy?!! Right?!! </h2>
<h2><a href="http://2012comingsoon2anearthnearyou.blogspot.ca/2017/03/in-name-of-truth-and-light-mark-these.html">http://2012comingsoon2anearthnearyou.blogspot.ca/2017/03/in-name-of-truth-and-light-mark-these.html</a></h2>
<h2>In these riddles/short stories you are going to find out what the “Grand Deception” is and also some insight into our “True Cosmic Destiny” and Believe Me --- it is all good news my friends!!! :)</h2>
<h2>A little background information in case you’re interested:</h2>
<h2>The reason why they are here right now, is because all of our Life up until this point, has been a Test --- and All of Us have passed big time Fam!!! --- We are now on the verge of Ascension!!!</h2>
<h2>Unfortunately, before we can “graduate” there is going to be some scary stuff --- and this message is to assure All of Us that there is nothing to be scared of at all. It is just a game. (And we have already passed, it is has already been written!!! But for some reason it has to be played out. I don’t know why yet.)</h2>
<h2>(Quick Side Note: You know those awesome crop circles? Not the shitty ones that were done by assholes with planks, but the really cool ones? And remember the one with the warning against gray aliens that said “We Oppose Deception?” --- well it turns out --- this was them!!!)</h2>
<p>Here is their Warning:</p>
<h2><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Crop+Circle+Gray+Alien+We+oppose+Deception&amp;atb=v39-1aq&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia-cache-ec0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F3c%2F54%2F0c%2F3c540cdcf9152d553aec51eeb63b1fa7.jpg">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Crop+Circle+Gray+Alien+We+oppose+Deception&amp;atb=v39-1aq&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images&amp;iai=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia-cache-ec0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F3c%2F54%2F0c%2F3c540cdcf9152d553aec51eeb63b1fa7.jpg</a></h2>
<h2>Very Important Note: It is “THE GRAY ALIENS” WHO THEY OPPOSE ---&gt; Gray Aliens are a very LOW vibrational entity --- they are like an interdimensional parasites that hide in the shadows, feeding off the vulnerable and the weak. :(</h2>
<h2>I truly apologize for my behaviour last week to anyone I spammed --- I got really excited when I started receiving messages and shared them all with as many people as I could before it was finished. These are “White Magic Spells in the Name of Truth and Light” though and so I guess the formatting is very important.</h2>
<h2>The way they channel me is very weird, it started off very gradually (I didn’t even know it was happening, at first) but I guess the more they worked with me, the more attuned I become to their frequency and slowly but surely it’s becoming easier to tell the difference.</h2>
<h2>In case you’re wondering why they choose me? Well your guess is as good as mine lol!!!</h2>
<h2>Pretty much because I’m harmless, want to stay anonymous and am very dedicated when spamming assholes with funny memes. These guys have a really amazing sense of humour and most of all they --- OPPOSE DECEPTION!!!  
</h2>
<h2>And listen they want to help All of Us, and if you send out a Call (Just sincerely ask for help “In the Name of Truth and Light” --- they will get in touch. Tbh, I think it probably works differently for everyone. I’m scared of everything, so they probably know better than to visit me “in person” lol!)</h2>
<h2>And yes, you better fucking BELIEVE This Is KEK’S Soul Group! :)~</h2>
<p>Oh and as I mentioned, these short stories/riddles are “White Magic Spells in the Name of Truth and Light” and are best read as thoroughly but as quickly as you can. (Oh and “Please Read The Second Spell First or You Will Have To Read The First Spell Twice.” lol)</p>
<hr />
<h2>You won’t likely won’t wake up right away and will probably think all of this is batshit crazy, but in the coming months, this message might come in handy! :)</h2>
<h2>Also in order for the Spells to have any chance of working, you will need to read them both in one sitting and one right after the other. (Don’t take them seriously at all --- just think of them as insight into someone who shouldn’t be allowed near a keyboard or a computer lol)</h2>
<h2>Thing of them as like a nutty Looney Tunes Cartoon set to paper! Please enjoy them and have fun! They are very very short!   :)</h2>
<h2>Also Please Note: </h2>
<h2>They love All of Us so very much!!!</h2>
<h2>Sincerely,</h2>
<p>Well somebody who is either in the throes of a severe psychotic break (which is causing them to rant like Elmer Fudd and write in riddles haha) or a Puppet being Channelled by the Best Soul Group Family Ever --- “The Jokers and The Fools!!!”</p>
<h2>:)~</h2>
<p>THIS HAS BEEN A BREAKING TRANSMISSION FROM THE JOKERS AND THE FOOLS
(And a very tired and happy puppet lol)</p>
<p>SO BE IT.</p>

            You're full of shit n you know it. Demographics don't matter when they aren't a source of conflict. The source of conflict IS foreign competition over the mineral resources of the region. Tehran DOES have a part in that. So does Washington, Moscow, Qatar, Saudis, Israel, Turkey... The ISIL jihadists rebels are funded and armed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey and Qatar. Not by Tehran and Moscow. Saudi and Qatar and Turkey in turn get their arms from the USA and Britain. The militant rebels aren't even Syrian. The rebels who are Syrian have repeatedly agreed and abided by ceasefires on promises of having representation in the government. The ISIL/all Nusra foreign mercenaries have refused any ceasefire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where DO you get your news? Because it's almost as if you've swallowed uncle sam's dick all the way up to his hairy white propaganda covered balls.
           </p>
           <p>
            You won't even address the 40 nations who monitored and approved of the election of Assad. You won't mention how UN investigators concluded the rebels used gas on civilians. You won't mention how governments other than Tehran are financing terrorism against the Assad government.
           </p>
           <p>
            The turnout in the 2014 election was &gt;  that turnout for the election was 73.42%, with 11,634,412 of the 15,845,575 Syrians eligible to take part voting.
           </p>
           <p>
            With total population of 22 million, if you include people ineligible to vote like children and Christians(totally fucked up on both counts by my opinion), that's still over 50% turnout. Way beyond that 20% figure you pulled out of thin air.

            I'm no fan of Assad, but honestly, he's less offensive than most asshat democratically elected representatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            His government has no legitimacy for the same reasons all government has no legitimacy: it's rooted in violence. But you don't need to go squawking like a crow repeating every stupid thing you hear from the US State Department like it's the Gospel Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rest of the world is pretty united behind the idea that the current Syrian government is not only legitimate but currently being attacked in another imperialist attempt at regime change, only now all these other states have seized on American weakness and taken the opportunity to spin things to their own advantages. Either way. The majority of the world is run by asshat statists who'd just as soon kill you as admit that they're wrong. So, hooray. You're welcome.

            I strongly question where you get your statistics on Syrian religious demographic because there hasn't been a census asking such a question since 1960.

            30 countries observed and approved of the 2014 elections in which Assad won by 88%. At that time, the rebels not only voluntarily withheld their vote, but they also shelled the Syrian people after threatened the people not to vote, killing at least 50.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US forbids independent monitoring of our elections. Syria embraced it. If you've got a problem with the results, you've got a bigger problem than Assad: Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, India, Iran, Iraq... The list goes on.

            So tell me again who is preventing democracy from occurring in Syria? It seems to me like the West has their hands in it.

           <p>
            So, the question still remains- why would a Sunni majority country support a Shia government? Well maybe because they aren't sectarian bastards, and maybe because the Syrian government offers free education and free healthcare to everyone, not just the Shiites. At least that's what

           <p>
            So yeh. You are absolutely fooled. Assad has the legitimate of 30 independent nations having monitored his elections. The fact that mercenaries funded by such horrid regimes as Turkey, Israel, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, and enabled by intelligence operatives from imperialist Western nations doesn't change the fact that Assad is president in the majority of Syria and he isn't mass murdering his people. He's defending them.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Full disclosure, Syria is still a state so they're still wrong, and I support the democratic Confederalists of those egalitarian Kurds who've doing everything Syria could do only better and with less.)

            You are so misinformed it makes me want to march right over there and rub your nose in these mass media lies that you're promoting.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's totally illegal and immoral. The West is financing terrorists. Go look at the UN reports concluding the rebels were responsible for the gas attacks. Look at the peace activists who've traveled that country and concluded that the mass media is wholly complicit in a propaganda war and that there is no civil war in Syria, only an insurgency led by foreign intelligence and fought by foreign mercenaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean, seriously are you still getting your news from CNN and FOX? Are you fucking daft?
           </p>
           <p>
            Syria has elected Assad. The sectarianism you think you see is wholly artificial. The vast majority of Syrians live under Assad in peace. ISIL was almost completely defeated ubtil Turkey sent in tanks and Israel and the US started providing them air support.

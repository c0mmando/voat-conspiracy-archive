<p>If we increase the focus on the nature of conspiracists, that is the nature of people who are behind hidden agendas to exploit, oppress, torture and murder, I think we will move closer to setting things straight. Some of the big \'conservative\' podcasts and so on, keep on documenting and hightlighting bad things that are being done by the psychopaths.

<p>In the long run, documenting that psychopaths are engaged in conspiracies, is not going to accomplish anything, I suspect. The presumption seems to be that there are \'some among us\' who did bad things, and got away with it, and that the solution is to document their trespass, and to then punish them.

<p>What we should do, what I think is the eventual solution that is going to come sooner or later, is to study and learn about the different types of human that exists, to study the different types of personality, motivations, the different types of brain.

<p>We used to demand that left-handed people write with their right hand. That doesn\'t make sense, and so we eventually figured this out, and let them write with their left hand.

<p>I noticed the topic of psychopathy, many years ago. Recently I\'ve noticed an additional approach, namely something called evolutionary psychology. The first evolutionary psychology presentation that I noticed, and it was not the first time but a couple of years later when I came across it a second time, is the Stefan Molyneux video Gene Wars - Part 3. From there I continued on to reading the book he partly based it on, The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics. And now I have, very happily, also discovered Dr. Edward Dutton \'The Jolly Heretic\' (pictured). Dutton livestreams on YouTube, and later removes the video, and instead keeps it on BitChute.</p>

            Interesting.  But modern society lacks almost any evolutionary pressures, except doing whatever it takes to get by or get ahead.  That's either the least effort necessary to scrape by, or being a sociopath to get farther ahead.

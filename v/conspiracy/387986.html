            Bloody good read! It is great to see that more and more information is coming out, even though TPTB are desperately trying to contain the mainstream narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this is one of the most poignant statements, I draw your attention in particular to the last sentence.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In place of Hilberg there came his friend Christopher Browning, an American professor who specializes in the Holocaust. Admitted as an expert witness (and paid for several days at the rate of $150 per hour by the Canadian taxpayer), Browning tried to prove that the Harwood pamphlet was a tissue of lies and that the attempt to exterminate the Jews was a scientifically established fact. He had cause to regret the experience. During cross-examination, the defense used his own arguments to destroy him. In the course of those days, people saw the tall and naive professor, who had strutted while he stood testifying, seated, shrunken in size, behind the witness stand like a schoolboy caught in a mistake. With a faint and submissive voice, he ended up acknowledging that the trial had definitely taught him something about historical research.

             Oh and i of course forgot the Eichman trial, You know the one where their was fountains of blood and the star witness claims he found piles of shoes and other detritus on a massive field that apparently the Nazi's had completely cleaned up. You should watch it, It is hilarious even hearing the judge trying to get the witnesses to fix their stories. Best KEK.

             One can only deny something that has a belief structure, like a religion....
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is the definition of belief if you need help with English.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              1.
an acceptance that something exists or is true, especially one without proof.
"his belief in extraterrestrial life"
2.
trust, faith, or confidence in (someone or something).
"a belief in democratic politics"
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Secondly, Wikipedia is not a source-able reference medium.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thirdly, Can you explain to me or show me any of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
             Vacuum chambers, Co chambers, Co2 chambers, Water chambers, Electrified water chambers, Electrified chambers, Gas (zyklon B) chambers, Roller coaster of death, Sexual torture machines of death, Chambers that opened from the bottom, Gas vans, Dr Mengele being everywhere, Inconsistent dates, Reports of multiple eye witness accounts of Death camps that are no longer Death camps, A bear with an eagle in a pit, Tattoos disappearing, Jewish fat soap, Human lampshades, 30 foot flames coming out of chimneys, People not noticing those flames till they are told to look, Multiple accounts of the same story, Multiple stories, A lack of any proof that there was enough fuel to burn victims, A lack of capacity to burn victims, Lies about how many could be burnt in an oven, Lies of how many fitted into the various chambers, Lies of both victims and rescuers as to times and their locations, Lies about meeting each other (see Oprah), Many inmate reports that there were no actual Gas chambers at any of the camps, The Russians building a fake chimney at Auschwitz, and creating a fake "gas chamber" (No.1), The Russians adding to building at Majdanak, Taking tour groups through he wrong way at the same, The wall of heroes at Auschwitz that has not a single bullet hole, The fake shower room constructed at Bergen-Belsen by the American propaganda machine, Fake us of dead bodies at all the camps...
            </p>
            <p>
             Then of course there is the insane law that finds you automatically guilty to even question the Narrative of the Holocaust. Why is that? If someone lies, is it not important to know? Why is even scientific evidence not allowed?
            </p>
            <p>
             Would you like some more?

             <p>
              The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering is a 2000 book by Norman G. Finkelstein in which he argues that the American Jewish establishment exploits the memory of the Nazi Holocaust for political and financial gain, as well as to further the interests of Israel.[1] According to Finkelstein, this "Holocaust industry" has corrupted Jewish culture and the authentic memory of the Holocaust.

            I think much of our history is fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Stalin really kill off 30 million Russians?  1/3 of the Russian population?  It's Bullshit.  Lies that are used to scare dumb Americans to believe that our Democracy/Capitaism is wonderful and Communism is pure evil.

            Everything you read and hear from the corporate media should be carefully analyzed.  Cui bono? (Who benefits?)  It'll explain why some events barely gets mentioned and others events become a media circus.

             Well, Stalin's deeds were documented by the Soviets and the numbers are not exaggerated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Holodomor is well documented, as is for example Katin's Massacre, which to this day is falsely blamed on the Nazis by Kremlin's shills, even though the documents confirming Stalin's orders were released by Yetlsin in the 90's.

              So Stalin kills 30 million and then Russia loses another 25 million in WW2.  So, 55 million were killed in a nation of 90 million.
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              I don't see the big drop in Russian population.  Russia's population has shown a very consistent growth pattern.  The only exception is the period after the 1917 Revolution and during WW2.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stalin is only documented to order the execution of some 800,000 political prisoners.  I'm sure that he is responsible for a lot more Russian deaths.  But some numbers are just too big to be true.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is definitely an agenda by the US-Anglo-Jewish Media to put Russian Communists in a bad light.
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW, the greatest mass killings that I know of were the Allied bombings of civilian populations of Germany and Japan.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, the Rape of Nanking where the Japanese killed 300,000 Chinese.  A city whose population at the time was numbered to be 300,000.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, after Katrina hit New Orleans and bodies where floating in the streets.  The media initially reported that 15,000 people may have died.  But the actual count was around a 1,000.  Unless someone actually counts the bodies, the numbers of the dead are always wildly exaggerated by the media.

               Did you take into consideration all the lands that were incorporated into the soviet union after the second world war? That's a huge increase in population from the annexed lands.

            It's crazy for how long all the experts have proved over and over again the lies of the alleged holocaust, yet I learned about it year after year after year, and to this day children and teenagers are still taught these same disproved lies.

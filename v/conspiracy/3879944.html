            No, it isn't. A Golem is a man-shaped monster made of clay and animated by Jewish magic into a semblance of life. Jesus was a living man. Stop talking about the Kabbalah -- you don't know what the fuck you are talking about. The Golem has no connection whatsoever to zombies or to people hypnotized.

            sure, a golem made to convert its own makers and flip an entire religion on its back after not only performing countless miracles and saving lives that were considered absolutely lost and deserted, but fundamentally AND philosophically creating a revolution in religious and spiritual thought

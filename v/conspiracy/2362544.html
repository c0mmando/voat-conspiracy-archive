<p>“The Post&quot; (2017) claims to be the story behind the Washington Post\'s publishing in 1971 of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers">Pentagon Papers</a>, which detail the secret history of the Vietnam War. The Pentagon Papers were leaked to the media by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg">Daniel Ellsberg</a>.</p>
<p>This film not only gets the basics of the story wrong, it\'s clear purpose is to enforce numerous other false histories, deceptions and cover-ups. I can\'t tell whether Steven Spielberg is a loveably, oblivious money making machine or a driven, statist propagandist.</p>
<p>Although seemingly innocent enough to the general public, the film promotes or enforces at least the following deceptions and historical fallacies...</p>
<p><strong>1.) The Cold War</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not you\'ve considered it in this way, the Cold War was used as the justification for unprecedented spending and countless injustices. The injustices range from medical and mind control experimentation on unwitting American subjects to immeasurably harmful geopolitical strategies and actions. Some make compelling arguments that the Cold War was a generally advantageous political talking point, but a false portrayal of what was actually an amicable relationship between the US and USSR.</p>
<p><strong>2.) Daniel Ellsberg - Whistleblower</strong></p>
<p>Daniel\'s parents Soviet Bolshevik Jews who migrated to Chicago and claimed to convert to Christianity. Right. Daniel goes to Harvard then Cambridge on a Woodrow Wilson+ scholarship. He then joins the Marines and becomes a lieutenant in 3 years. Going back top Harvard he joins the Society of Fellows. His first job is as a strategic analyst for the RAND Corp. In 1964 he travels to South Vietnam and works under General Edward Lansdale and the State Department. When he returns to the states working for RAND he suddenly becomes anti-war. Can you see the difficulty in accepting this highly dubious storyline? Daniel Ellsberg is and always has been an agent of the state.</p>
<p><strong>3.) Who Published the Pentagon Papers?</strong></p>
<p>“The Post” would have us believe it was the Washington Post that received the documents from Ellsberg, did the due diligence required and took all the risk in publishing the material. In fact, Ellsberg sent the Pentagon Papers exclusively to the New York Times. The Times was awarded victory by the SCOTUS and won a Pulitzer Prize as a result of their work, not the Post.</p>
<p><strong>4.) The Nixon Tapes</strong></p>
<p>Americans became familiar with a certain recorder through the recordings that became associated with the Watergate scandal, also known as the &quot;Nixon Tapes.&quot; In the former Soviet Union and in the meeting rooms of any American think tank, this recorder would be known as a &quot;bug.&quot; Have you asked yourself, why doesn\'t Obama or Trump record their Oval Office conversations? Probably because nobody in their right mind would, including Nixon.</p>
<p><strong>5.) Edward Snowden - Whistleblower</strong></p>
<p>Snowden somehow made his way from the states to Hong Kong and on to Russia, all while being a wanted man by the State Department and intelligence community. He then stayed in a single room with a female journalist friend for over a month without showering. Not one of the hundreds of reporters who invaded the airport claimed to have seen him. Snowden doesn\'t have a college degree and dropped out of Special Forces training when he broke both legs in an accident. Snowden teamed up with Glenn Greenwald as the go-between for his 1,000,000+ pages of classified docs. But how many have been released?</p>
<p><strong>6.) Bob Woodward - Journalist</strong></p>
<p>The reporting of Woodward and Bernstein is thought by many to be the single greatest reporting effort of all time. Right. To begin with, Woodward went to Yale and was a member of Book and Snake. Back in 1971, nobody was questioning how some lit major had suddenly become a prominent reporter for the Washington Post. Later, however the problem began to emerge and required evasive maneuvering. It was decided that an old and defunct weekly newspaper based out of Maryland, the Montgomery Sentinel would serve as a fake entry on Bob\'s resume. So, the official biography of Woodward now shows him as a reporter for this tiny, weekly paper with no official subscribership and only sold occasionally through a few 7-11 stores. Only after working there for a full year does he get the job at the Post.</p>
<p><strong>7.) The Nuclear Threat</strong></p>
<p>As pointed out in the Cold War section above, the cold war may have been a false portrayal of what was actually an amicable relationship between the US and USSR. If true, one can imagine how it would impact the true threat (or lack thereof) of a thermonuclear war. Additionally, there\'s a ton of conspiratorial material on the web suggesting that nuclear bombs are not real. Some suggest that nuclear radiation and nuclear power are real, but that nuclear bombs are not.</p>
<p><strong>8.) The Holocaust</strong></p>
<p>In 1994, Steven Spielberg founded the Shoah Foundation to record the stories of holocaust survivors. Need I say more?</p>
<p><strong>9.) The Shoah Foundation</strong></p>
<p>One would think that, after founding the Shoah Foundation and then subsequently watching some of the claims made by purported holocaust survivors that Steven Spielberg would make a statement denouncing the lies and mischaracterizations. Does he ignore the elephant in the room out of respect for the elderly, loyalty to his fellow Jews or in order that he and his Hollywood enablers can squeeze every last penny out of the holocaust industry?</p>
<p><strong>10.) The Watergate Break In</strong></p>
<p>\'Watergate\' is the story of the top-level assassination squad that dropped their weapons and surrendered to a couple beat cops at the Watergate hotel in Washington DC. Can you already sense that something isn\'t right about this story?</p>
<p>As many are aware, the Washington Post is now owned by Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. To many, this development signaled the complete transition by the Post into a mouthpiece of the state. But as I\'ve shown above, there\'s reason to suspect the Post was a hidden department of government since as early as \'71. Not only has the Post written about history, accurately or falsely, it has become a part of history. And the film, &quot;The Post&quot; only expands upon and enforces the deception.</p>

            A lot of this isn't specifically about the movie, The Post, but it's all still interesting stuff to research.

            I hadn't considered any of that stuff about Ellsberg; hadn't read up on him actually. But I agree totally with Snowden. This story makes little to no sense. His
            <em>
             evidence
            </em>
            was nothing but shitty powerpoint slides. Yet international media ate the Snowden documents and shun the mountains of evidence showing 9/11 was a demolition and false flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone loves to hate Trump right now, because he's the
            <s>
             2 minute
            </s>
            24/7 hate. We've been living in 1984 for longer than I've been alive, and longer than my parent's have been alive.

             Agreed. Thanks for sharing that. Since you mention 1984, I'll leave you with yet another  puzzle. Orwell's real name was Eric Blaire and 1984 was originally entitled, 1949.

              I knew about the original title (although I thought it was 1948, but whatever) as he was talking about events he saw happening at that time. I didn't realize he used a pen name though. I wonder why.

            I gather the dude that wrote that ignored the fact that fuckloads of graduates ended up in the military industrial complex during the cold war, AND in battlezones as civillian operatives, and there are FUCKTONS OF VETS THAT ARE ANTI WAR. Its as if theyve seen horrors with their own eyes and dont want others to have to go through it or something.

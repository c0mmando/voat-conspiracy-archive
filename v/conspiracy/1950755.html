High IQ means we are less susceptible to indoctrination within the &quot;reality&quot; they have created. &quot;mental illness&quot; is a label equivalent to &quot;wrong think&quot; in 1984.

Society is designed to push us towards disconnecting from nature/spirituality and to see ourselves as separate. When you are working a 9-5 job, driving an audi, clean cut wearing a suit and well shaven, struggling to pay off all your debt, you\'re part of the machine. You aren\'t thinking about this kind of shit. Even though a lot of people know deep down there\'s more to life than this. </p>

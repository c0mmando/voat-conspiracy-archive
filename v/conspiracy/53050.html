            Yes. Not sure what else there is to say really. It's been a strategy for a very long time, both in regards to foreign policy and domestically - sending out Agent Provocateurs is just one example, FBI radicalizing stupid people and then supplying them with weapons and then arresting them as terrorist is another.

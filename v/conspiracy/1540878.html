             In order for that to be true, you would have to believe that HRC or Ted Cruz wouldn't have made better lapdogs than Trump.

               Not really. We are controlled. Nobody is falling out of line or bringing resistance. It's about controlling perception and HRC would have done more for globalism in her first year than the last 30 years of presidents combined.
Goals of globalists - Open borders, Devalued US Currency, weakened economy (similar but not the same as devalued currency), Dependent upon allies, Strong UN Presence and eventually, a fall of the republic to turn over to a North American Union.
              </p>
              <p>
               Trump does not help any of those causes. Sometimes you just have to look at what's in front of you.

                That you see a difference between HRC and DJT means you are not perceiving correctly.

                 I believe nearly 40 years of evidence that show Trump being pro-america.
I believe a video showing a random street lady living for free for 8 years in Trump Tower that Trump never has mentioned in his life.
I see Trump implementing restrictions on his administration from future lobbying.
I see Putin stating he will "Wait for the future administration" before acting against the US

                 I could go on and on. It's unfortunate that a lot of US Citizens suffer from battered woman syndrome because the current relationship with a good man is suffering because of it.

                  I wish I could believe you. I imagine it would be nice to have hope for the future. Maybe you are right and Trump is a good man. Maybe They are just waiting till inauguration so President Pence can declare war on Russia or China or Albania.

                   Don't confuse my interpretation of events thus far as "hope for the future". I simply believe what I can see and what I know to be true. The minute I'm shown something to make me believe otherwise about Trump, I will believe that. I don't hold firm to any one line of thought.

                    I just don't believe the globalists would let an actual threat continue to exist. If your not already concerned by the globalists in Trumps cabinet I don't know what to show you.

            There was no way to predict the wikileaks or how pissed off the angry white male (/s) would be. It was aptly put that if they'd had a better grasp upon the situation then they would have pumped much more money into the effort of getting Hillary the presidency. 
Is Trump good? Well, he appears to be. You can bet your ass if they could have slandered him more or found better dirt on him, they would have. Also, there are a lot of good deeds in his history that no one has even spoken about. He doesn't brag about those things. I would like to think that speaks volumes.
           </p>

            Of course, there is always speculation and only time will tell through his future endeavors. It's so very important that we all pay close attention to what is really going on and not allow them to alter the truth. There will be non stop attempts to prevent him from being successful. We need to make sure that people help support the agendas that we want to see and be aware of those things affecting those outcomes. By the same token we have to make sure that we hold him accountable above all, no back tracking. America needs to be done with having presidents that do not do what they say they will.

            I suppose one could be concerned that he is a Zionist since so much of his family, friends, and business associates are Jewish, as well as his professed dedication to Israel. But not all Zionists are Jewish and not all Jews are Zionists. Also, if he is a Christian man he will believe the bible and believe he should protect Israel.

            The hurry up and wait is painful. I can't wait to see what happens in the next four to eight years.

            You really have to learn to read between the lines with Trump. For instance, when he was at that Catholic dinner party where I think Maria Bartoloma's (sp?) boobs were right behind him the whole time and he and Hillary roasted each other. Well, if you remember that dinner, you will remember when he said, "You know, I used to come where with my father when I was a kid. It's been a long time, but I remember coming here back then and thinking of how special a place this is. Well, it's been a while hasn't it? Anyhow, it's good to be here with everyone, thank you for the invite."
           </p>
           <p>
            That was Trump saying, "You cock suckers should have kept me in your little circle. Now I'm going to shit all over you. I'll teach you to not invite me to your little parties."
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many examples of him using almost coded wording in which he is basically telling the globalists that they are fucked. All you have to do is listen.

            I suspect he's better than Hillary. Right now I'm thinking of him as a power player going for more power. I would guess his first priority will be his family legacy, and next to that would be rewarding his business partners.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I think of him as part of the establishment, I also think he's in a power struggle with the rest of the establishment. I hope that works out better than having a pawn in the Whitehouse four to eight more years.

            We stand here, all of us, the children of our fathers. And we are proud. Our fathers and their fathers before them have achieved great and mighty accomplishments. They’ve traveled the world, conquering, building monuments to the glory and magnanimity of their lives, testaments to stand against the ages announcing their lives’ worth to generations who will have long forgotten their names, tribes, languages, and culture. We live in a culture that our ancestors spilled their sweat and blood to keep alive from the countless woes and perils that have best our lands and countries. We come from a family upon whose backs empires have been wrought from the Earth. And it is for this reason the world hates us. Don’t think that they don’t. They hate us because in order to build these empires we had to subjugate their cultures. They hate us because in order to build our monuments we had to take their stone. They hate us because in order to build our culture we had to subvert theirs. But it’s not because these things are evil that they hate us.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It’s because they didn’t think of it first.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The thieves and mongrels that live outside the developed western world have nothing but a mockery of culture dominated by the leftover swill and crumbs from our dinner-side conversations. Their countries are weak because they are full of weak men. Their culture is weak because it is full of weak men. Their lives are meaningless and pitiful because they are meaningless and pitiful people.The world is our birthright and they hate us because our fathers have given us the world while theirs faltered in the mire of irrelevance. It is madness for us to give up what has been built for us. It is insanity to think that the cultures of the so-called third world would have the mettle to govern themselves when they didn’t have running water until we built for them, electricity until we gave it to them, medicine until we injected it into them. It is pure madness to think that these cultures have any value other than what they have created, and they have created little value. Their poverty is their own making and we have no more duty to them than we have duty to the air we breathe.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             It is natural for some cultures to rise and others to fall. We should be proud that it is our culture that has risen.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is madness for us to go against the grain of nature and suicidal to give up the history which we have fought and died to protect from the mongrels that would take it from us. Their very existence is an affront to reason, that they would choose to e a part of a culture that has given them nothing but trouble and attack a culture that has built everything they value. And to the men inside our culture who wish to give away our birthright, I tell them to leave it first. Be the first to shed the shackles of the so-called “white supremacy” of European domination. Be the first to give up your iPhones, your manufactured goods, your motorcars, and your heated homes. Be the first to live off the wild, fend for yourselves, and hunt and gather like the natives of which you’re so fond.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             If you hate our culture, you should not benefit from it.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            We live in a time when our enemies have never been more numerous. We live in an age when the self-defeating ideologies of masochistic ignorance is touted as the one and only correct belief. Our countrymen have lost faith in our right to rule–the right that is, by all measures, the birthright that our ancestors had forged for us when they lifted the rocks for Stonehenge and built the great cities of Rome, Paris, London, and Athens–the pinnacles of architecture that in their time had not been matched for a thousand years after they rations had fallen. Our right to rule is taken by our might and will, instilled in us by the generations of glory that ensured and protected the existence of a civilized world. We are the products of a civilized world and we have a right to that world.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             And we are proud of it.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Spare us your platitudes, natives, your lectures on the evils of racism and cultural appropriation. Spare us your pity and your petty anger, your stories of woe and white guilt. You talk without end of your great culture, your harmony with nature, and your way of life. Yet where has it gotten you? Where are your feats of engineering, your voyages of discovery? Where are you scientific advances, your technological wonders, your insight into the nature of the Universe? Even at our basest–when we dressed ad you do, hunted as you do, lived as you do–we did more than merely survive. We built wonders. We forged epics. We carved our names in stone and secured our place in history.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             You did not.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            We came to America in search of land and resources. Whether you had let us in (as you did) or driven us off, the result would have been the same. And in a thousand years, you would not have changed from your contact with the white man. We would return once again, more advanced and enlightened, to find you still living in your huts, hunting with bows and spears, communing with your Great Spirit–a sad parody of civilization, lacking the special spark to become something more. Because you refused to advance, to adapt, to improve, you yourselves doomed your “culture” to a painful death. To blame us for your demise is as useful as blaming the sea for washing away a sandcastle. You had the run of this land for thousands of years, and because you wasted that time this land has been taken from you. And above your graves we carry on, ever improving, ever expanding, constantly reaching for a higher plane of existence. We conquered you all and we set you free. The only force that can bring us to our knees is our own. You think a brief moment of lethargy is a sign of our downfall? Our blood was forged in the frost of mother Europe, tempered like the extremophiles which became the archetype of all true life. And every time we fell, we found a way to rise again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not mistake our cuts for mortal wounds or our slumber for a lifeless corpse unless you want to make the same mistake that all the other opportunistic hordes lost throughout the ages have done. By all means, continue your heckling and defilement of our legacy, continue with your delusions of victory. The sooner you wake the sleeping giant, the better. It matters not how many of us remain when it happens. We have turned the tide against greater calamities before. Mother Earth will once again feel the marching feet of her greatest children on her surface. Perhaps this time in true unity, and perhaps this time to your lament. With less mercy.

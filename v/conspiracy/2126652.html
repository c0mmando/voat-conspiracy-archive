            Contained in the FBI's reports of information that was gathered over a few months of investigations was a contact sheet with businesses and numbers for the 5 Israelis and the 1 Owner of the company that fronted their operations, Urban Moving Systems.
           </p>
           <p>
            From inside of this letter, was a complete list of names of companies that seemed harmless upfront, but formed a series of messages from a multi layered cipher system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beginning with the title, and moving into acrostics and Biliteral Ciphers that spelled out operations, coded words and full phrases are derived to show that ISRAELI's were taking messages from US Military associates and that these were given to the agents to brief them as they were not told of their plans till they got here through these operations.
           </p>
           <p>
            They were told one thing up front, but of course that's part of their excuses as you will see that they also planned alibis for the agents and gave them the cover story in the coding.

            )
           </p>
           <p>
            even had a a CPU programmer planned to be killed here as well for a heist of software that was used to set up their networks

             This proves the theory of the Amerithrax Letters
            </a>
            as they both are geared at using the MR.Z Monikers as a source of their encoding
           </p>
           <p>
            MR. BABBA or MR. Z is none other than BIBI NETANYAHU IMO
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT again this is a network and the original Z Agents were known by an assortment of names.
           </p>
           <p>
            One was CRUZ one was HOLT one was AQUINO one was NEITZEL and there was even the Z Agent in Vermont that was working with Leahy on the East Team in Project Monarch and Operation Northwoods
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is calling it PIZZAGATE but that is a front......the real game is called Project Monarch and the terror network is run through Operation Northwoods associates still to this day
           </p>
           <p>
            The first two vids are showing the Z agents in the Amerithrax Letters, as well as the use of older Zodiac and Scorpion Ciphers.....to plot out the original Phantom Menace called ISIS

             THE ORANGE THEORY
            </p>
            <p>
             based from the exposure of the FBI's AMERITHRAX CASE and their coined term for their suspect MR. Z
            </p>
            <p>
             The same drumroll theme can be seen in the Urban Moving Systems Cipher in their contacts sheet
            </p>
            <p>
             Produces a MMMRRRR BABBA
            </p>
            <p>
             (MR BIBI is what I see here)
            </p>
            <p>
             But run through Francis Bacon's Biliteral Cipher Systems it speaks volumes
            </p>
            <p>
             It shows that BABBA is the Key for the letter Z
            </p>
            <p>
             MR. Z is the guy the FBI called their suspect
            </p>
            <p>
             Its unreal how they coincide.....the whole online media frenzy was alive looking for MR. Z

              Take a closer look
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Title are the letters UMSIDPLESVPAAF
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Anagram Maker I use frequently it reveals the key to the message as this is the first thing noticed about the segregation of the Title sections and the lower patterned acrostics
            </p>
            <p>
             The Title is a horizontal acrostic using the first letters of the page
            </p>
            <p>
             Results are the descriptors to its decipherment
            </p>
            <p>
             1) MAP FIVE PLUS AD (layout 5x5's + add below)
2) VALUES PAD PIMP (One-Time Pad / PiMP)
3) MAP FLED VISAS UP (alibi for students)
4) IF MAP SAVED PLUS (save hidden info)
5) FIVE AD UP PSALM (? possible columnar composition of 15 letters each in columns)
6) ADVISES FLAP LUMP (Missile Pod Recommended For Wing Of Plane)
            </p>
            <p>
             After running the cipher through a Biliteral System (segregating the letters into blocks of 5) the Capitals are assigned a "B" and the Lowercase are assigned an "A"
            </p>
            <p>
             The variances of CaPs vs. LOWerCase letters makes the pattern recognizable
            </p>
            <p>
             They produce a series of keys for the one time pads and then you take the letters that are in the Contact list in full........laying them out in these columns in a specific order to take the words and rearrange them using the 5x5 squares.....you take them and enter them as it said....
            </p>
            <p>
             MAP 5 so you map them in fives
            </p>
            <p>
             PLUS AD so you use a vertical entry as if they were being mathematically set into addition tables left to right top to bottom

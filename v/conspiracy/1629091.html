<p>BOOKS (by last name)
Bruno Bettleheim… Freud and man\'s soul (how entire psychiatric community distorted his work, they worked against him,  they purposely mistranslated his work completely destroying his real message) VERY IMPORTANT WORK.
<a href="http://suraj.lums.edu.pk/">http://suraj.lums.edu.pk/</a>~ss182/Books/Bruno%20Bettelheim%20--%20Freud%20and%20Man%27s%20Soul.html
English renditions of Freud\'s writings distort much of the essential humanism that permeates the originals. Freud often spoke of the soul--of its nature and structure, its development, its attributes, how it reveals itself in all we do and dream. Unfortunately, nobody who reads him in English could guess this, because nearly all his many references to the soul, and to matters pertaining to the soul, have been excised in translation
          Freud was influenced by goethe

<p>Water Flouride Safe &amp; Danger list (look it up)</p>
<p>How to Remove Fluoride from Drinking Water</p>
<p>How do you remove Fluoride from tap water? Or any water for that matter?</p>
<p>Ways to Remove Fluoride from Water</p>
<p>Reverse Osmosis Filtration
This process is used for purifying some, but not all types of bottled water. Reverse osmosis systems is typically not affordable for personal or general public use.</p>
<p>Activated Alumina Defluoridation Filter
A home water filtration solution. But it\'s quite an expensive solution at approximately $30/filter and the filters require frequent replacement.</p>
<p>Distillation Filtration
Commercial distillation filters that can be purchase to remove fluoride from water. While the fluoride can be removed from distilled water, it still may have other impurities that could prevent it from being unusable as drinking water.</p>
<p>Brita, Pur, and other Filters
These filters do not remove Fluoride. If you check the websites, and labels, the descriptions state that fluoride is left in the water after filtration.</p>
<p>Will Boiling Water Remove Fluoride?
No, this will only concentrate the fluoride rather than reduce it.</p>
<p>Will Freezing Water Reduce Fluoride?
No, this method has no affect on the presence of fluoride.</p>
<p>Quotes</p>
<p>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read or write, but those who cannot unlearn the many lies that they have been conditioned to believe, and seek out the hidden knowledge that they have been conditioned to reject.  ~Gavin Nascimento</p>
<p>&quot;George W. Bush used to famously say that terrorists hated America for its freedoms.
So he and Barack Obama conveniently solved that problem by eliminating America’s freedoms.&quot;
Simon Black</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm#menu">http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_sociopol_bush.htm#menu</a> </p>
<p>“Enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It\'s seeing through the facade of pretense. It\'s the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.”
? Adyashanti</p>
<p>Ian Williams Goddard: A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and deserves the Police State Dictatorship it’s going to get.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, some are born with spiritual immune systems that sooner or later give rejection to the illusory worldview grafted upon them from birth through social conditioning. They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over the veils of ignorance.”
? Henri Bergson</p>
<p>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. Jiddu Krishnamurti

<p>Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives…. I think we’re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends … and I think I’m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That’s what’s insane about it.

<p>Always listen to reason and truth, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel. If you ignore the truth because of your own ego bullshit, you do so at your own peril. - Mark Passio</p>
<p>Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. Man is the only living species that has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.

           How to Remove Fluoride from Drinking Water
          </p>
          <p>
           How do you remove Fluoride from tap water? Or any water for that matter?
          </p>
          <p>
           Ways to Remove Fluoride from Water
          </p>
          <p>
           Reverse Osmosis Filtration
This process is used for purifying some, but not all types of bottled water. Reverse osmosis systems is typically not affordable for personal or general public use.
          </p>
          <p>
           Activated Alumina Defluoridation Filter
A home water filtration solution. But it's quite an expensive solution at approximately $30/filter and the filters require frequent replacement.
          </p>
          <p>
           Distillation Filtration
Commercial distillation filters that can be purchase to remove fluoride from water. While the fluoride can be removed from distilled water, it still may have other impurities that could prevent it from being unusable as drinking water.
          </p>
          <p>
           Brita, Pur, and other Filters
These filters do not remove Fluoride. If you check the websites, and labels, the descriptions state that fluoride is left in the water after filtration.
          </p>
          <p>
           Will Boiling Water Remove Fluoride?
No, this will only concentrate the fluoride rather than reduce it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Will Freezing Water Reduce Fluoride?
No, this method has no affect on the presence of fluoride.

           The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read or write, but those who cannot unlearn the many lies that they have been conditioned to believe, and seek out the hidden knowledge that they have been conditioned to reject.  ~Gavin Nascimento

           "George W. Bush used to famously say that terrorists hated America for its freedoms.
So he and Barack Obama conveniently solved that problem by eliminating America’s freedoms."

           “Enlightenment is a destructive process. It has nothing to do with becoming better or being happier. Enlightenment is the crumbling away of untruth. It's seeing through the facade of pretense. It's the complete eradication of everything we imagined to be true.”

           Ian Williams Goddard: A society whose citizens refuse to see and investigate the facts, who refuse to believe that their government and their media will routinely lie to them and fabricate a reality contrary to verifiable facts, is a society that chooses and deserves the Police State Dictatorship it’s going to get.

           “Fortunately, some are born with spiritual immune systems that sooner or later give rejection to the illusory worldview grafted upon them from birth through social conditioning. They begin sensing that something is amiss, and start looking for answers. Inner knowledge and anomalous outer experiences show them a side of reality others are oblivious to, and so begins their journey of awakening. Each step of the journey is made by following the heart instead of following the crowd and by choosing knowledge over the veils of ignorance.”

           Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives…. I think we’re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends … and I think I’m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That’s what’s insane about it.

           Always listen to reason and truth, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you feel. If you ignore the truth because of your own ego bullshit, you do so at your own peril. - Mark Passio

           Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. Man is the only living species that has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.

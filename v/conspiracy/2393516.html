            im convinced assange is dead and has been dead. He was not in front of a crowd, that was old footage that was presented as new. He hasn't been seen since his power was shut off in October of 2016 and the Embassy cat stopped tweeting for quite some time. His accounts are now controlled opposition and he is dead.

            I think he's dead or captured. He used to frequently pop out onto the balcony at the embassy but hasn't since his internet was cut briefly and somebody climbed the wall. It would be so easy for him to show himself and dispel all the rumours, which he's had no problem doing before, be he hasn't. It doesn't make sense; if he was free, we would have seen him in the flesh in the last 6 months.

             That's where I'm at as well. I wonder though, how long will they keep this up? When Assange is 95, are they still gonna pretend he's in there? I just can't figure out their exit plan for this narrative if he really is long gone.

            My thoughts are that it is ridiculous to still be persecuting this man, who it is obvious the Deep State set up for a fall to get him out of the way. Assange is being persecuted unjustly. All charges against him should be dropped.

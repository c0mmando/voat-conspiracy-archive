           Everyone I've spoken to has reported that July had a variety of weird, and/or bad, things happening to them throughout the entire month. I myself had a month where it seemed like one little thing after another kept happening.
          </p>

           The people I work with all had a bad month as well. Without getting into too many details, it was as if at the start of the month someone flipped a switch that started effecting the way people go about their daily routines and how they think.
          </p>
          <p>
           After talking to someone that was in an entirely different part of the country, and them reporting similar occurrences, I got sort of curious.

            The newspaper people used to call it the "silly season." When it gets too hot to do anything, the minds of people turn to space aliens, bigfoot and haunted toasters that talk to them. It happens every summer.

            I called it "bloody July" at work- small family business and I am the only person working there that isn't somehow married in or longtime friends with someone there.  So on the 3rd my friend and a company og got fired.  Middle of the month, the family that owns and runs it just packs up and goes deep into the woods for over a week, unreachable by any signal.  Then they came back and fired another person. Last day of the month, supervisor is hanging around me just staring weird like a weight on him.  I was very anxious.  Made it august though.  Everyone was trading stories of their suspicions of wtf is going on with the owner.

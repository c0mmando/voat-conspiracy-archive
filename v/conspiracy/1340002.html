<p>Hypothesis: Peter thiel is helping trump with resources and expertise as a means to remove his enemies from Washington. </p>
<p>This election is an abnormal one. The regressive political scientists will tell you otherwise, but that is because they do not understand data analytics despite being heavily dependent on it. </p>
<p>What i have been curious about, is peter thiel\'s involvement in all of this. How does an openly gay libertarian get a standing ovation at the RNC, while ted cruz gets booed. That was a detail that was buried by the media real fast. </p>
<p>We know thiel from the gawker lawsuit and destruction. He funded hulk hogan. We know he had a vendetta against gawker because they ousted him as a homosexual. This was viewed as a scumbag move by everyone in the media. It also was quickly buried. </p>
<p>Yet this brings up a lot of questions: Why did gawker publish this story on peter thiel? Gawker was a tabloid. Thiel was not that famous, and really not tabloid worthy. He was very rich, part of a very powerful firm that spies on people for profit, has huge government connections. So why make enemies with him. It does not make sense. </p>
<p>Was nick denton stupid, or was he working with someone else? did someone put him up to publishing this story? Thiel is connected to the people who brought down acorn. </p>
<p>If thiel does have enemies in wallstreet and washington, he would know it. He is the type of tech entrepreneur that you can not keep secrets from. As we have seen from this election, the democrats are unable to keep secrets. </p>
<p>As such, i suspect that he is going to get trump elected. Trump would be the perfect candidate for him. Trump has economic incentive to be a popular president: He makes money off of his name. If he is unpopular, then being president will hurt him far more than if he avoided politics. </p>
<p>IF Trump can remove thiels enemies, then i suspect that thiel will use his data analytics resources to make sure trump is popular among the people, which will exponentially expand the trump name not just in the US, but overseas as well.</p>',

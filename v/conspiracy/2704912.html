            Nazism arose in Germany in reponse to street fascism by the communists against the German people. The communists were led by Jews, and these communist gangs were largely composed of Jews. Communism itself is a Jew creation. The Brown Shirts began to patrol the streets to defend average German men and women from the violence and intimidation of the communist thugs, and when Nazis met communists, they often fought.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, Jew propaganda translated this into a narrative in which evil Nazi thugs were roaming the streets, looking for innocent people to beat up. No rational reason is ever given by the Jews for this supposed behavior, but the implication is that the Nazis were just really, really evil and wanted to hurt people for fun, and also to force them into supporting the Nazi Party. This is the cracked, irrational Jew explanation, and as usual it is exactly the opposite of the truth, because the Jews can't resist projecting their own failures and vices onto others. It was the communist gangs that roamed the streets, using violence to force the people to support the  communist party in Germany. Nazism would never have come into being at all were it not for the violence and crimes of the communists.

            The Jews certainly did align with the Communists throughout Eastern Europe when they tried to take it over. This is what some cardinals/archbishops in Poland say at least.

             The Jews have done their level best since the end of WW2 to bury the truth as to why the German people felt such animosity against them. The general explanation, if it can be called that, is that Germans were just really, really racist and bigoted and prejudiced and anti-Semitic, and decided to hate the Jews no good reason at all. Sometimes Jews suggest that they were made into a "scapegoat" -- which, by the way, is a Jewish concept and something out of Jewish history, i.e., something Jews did.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality is that Germans resented and hated the Jews because the Jews profited and benefited hugely at their expense. The Jews took control over Germany after the end of WW1, destroyed the German economy through greed and corruption, and let ordinary German Christians starve in the streets. When the Jews tried to assume total and absolute control through communism, Germany reacted in its own defense with Nazism. Naturally, the Jews used the media to demonize the Nazis, and have never ceased doing it.

              Yeah, history is rewritten by the victors. The Nazis should have never gone after the Orthodox Jews. That was their biggest problem. 70% of the Jews they killed were Orthodox Jews who were no threat to Germany.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think the Nazis should have done more to back Walter Rathenau and try to use him as a leverage point to get Jews to be sent to Turkey, North Africa, or the area of Palestine, preferably Lebanon or Syria. Some Jews might have headed for Russia even, since Bolshevik Russia was on friendly terms with them.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Nazis dealt with Brandl anyways to negotiate a peace with the West in exchange for sending people to death camps. Stalin approached his issue with minorities in a much better way. He just scattered them throughout the Middle-East or Turkey and did not kill many people, although there is Holdomor, which proves Stalin was a true beast. I think when ever you radicalize too much you start to incubate and inculcate the ways and forms of your enemy and become like them in some manner.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Nazis should have adhered to the Nietszchean principle that when fighting with monsters one should never become monsters.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jews don't demonize the Nazis that much. They use it as a ploy to destroy the white race. They have become like the Nazis in many ways and maybe even worse.

              I haven't read it, but in it he supposedly talks about extermination of Jews by throwing them into fiery pits.   This apparently was dropped out of the narrative, have you heard of it anywhere else?
             </p>
             <p>
              Everywhere else there is talk about cremation and gas chambers, but only he talks about the fiery pits.

               He talks about cremation. He says he can tell what kind of Jew was being burned by the color of the smoke from the chimney, ie green for Hungarian, pink for Polish etc.

            “To describe the differences between these versions as a stylistic reworking is to miss the extent of what is suppressed in the French. Un di velt depicts a post-Holocaust landscape in which Jewish boys “run off” to steal provisions and rape German girls; Night extracts from this scene of lawless retribution a far more innocent picture of the aftermath of the war, with young men going off to the nearest city to look for clothes and sex. In the Yiddish, the survivors are explicitly described as Jews and their victims (or intended victims) as German; in the French, they are just young men and women. The narrator of both versions decries the Jewish failure to take revenge against the Germans, but this failure means something different when it is emblematized, as it is in Yiddish, with the rape of German women. The implication, in the Yiddish, is that rape is a frivolous dereliction of the obligation to fulfill the “historical commandment of revenge”; presumably fulfillment of this obligation would involve a concerted and public act of retribution with a clearly defined target. Un di velt does not spell out what form this retribution might take, only that it is sanctioned — even commanded — by Jewish history and tradition.”

             They sure must have been healthy and well-fed, if their first thought was to rape.

              Spending most of the war in what amounts to the equivalent of a USA minimum-security resort-prison: I'd believe it.

<p>What really bugged me was what this implies. Are we going to see this more often, statements like <em>&quot;according to google\'s definition of&quot;</em> historical and political accounts. Are we going to encounter users that don\'t even bother to go to any source material, in this case the UN, which has been largely responsible for adopting the word \'genocide\' after world war 2. </p>
<p>Is this just about controlling information? Or is this some kind of business decision by google wanting to pull out of the search space, because I can\'t see them being a valuable search engine if their is going to be conflict between them and the source material. </p>
<p>What do you people think? </p>

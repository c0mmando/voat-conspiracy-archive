            Neocons and Israel will use it to try to drag us into a war, they will tell us it's all Iran's fault. But they will have a hard time to tell us that it was a missile coming from Iran because it was not the first missile strike on SA - we have already seen Patriot systems in action in Riyadh in the news. There were already attacks on oil infrastructure deep in SA, the last one just a few days ago. The Houthis attack airports, oil infrastructure and military bases with different drones and missiles every day, and learn in the process how to deal with the Patriot systems. It was not the first time they have landed a direct hit. And Neocons and Israel will have a hard time to convince us that the missiles are shipped from Iran into Yemen - there are just too many of them and the Houthis are surrounded and have no port.

              The Houthis claim it was their drones (used to crash into the radar of the Patriot systems) and their cruse missiles (for the final blow, one was found crashed nearby in the desert). They do it almost every day, hitting airports, military bases and oil infrastructure deep in Saudi territory, so there is no reason not to believe them. But Pompeo and Israel are claiming now that it was two missiles directly fired from Iraq or Iran. They want to tell us that they have the smoking gun, that Iran has committed an act of war and that we have to invade now to stop them.

             The USG is bankrupt.  It's been running on fumes, and is probably being propped up (temporarily) by monied interests until they can find a reason to crash it and congeal more power (more laws).

             Look at 1929 and the great depression.  Banking interests along with the newly formed Federal Reserve, tightened the money supply (after radical expansion) and the government confiscated gold.  They blamed the stock market, but the stock market ran up because of the radical money expansion by the Fed in the prior years.
            </p>
            <p>
             It works like this... if you're an investor and you see the value of money decreasing, but the value of running a business as returning a higher rate than the decreasing value of money, you're going to invest and create more business activity.  If the value of money is increasing, you're going to find holding your money better than investing.  This is what happened in 1929.  Prior years, money was expanding (value decreasing), so the stock market and investment went wild.  In 1929, they reversed that trend and everyone that borrowed money from the banks to leverage to buy stocks and invest (leverage) could no longer get loans.  Investments dried up and the stock market crashed.  It was better to not produce because the value of money was increasing (deflation).  Thus, massive unemployment, no production, etc.
            </p>

             "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." - Thomas Jefferson

             What's worse is that the federal government blamed gold holders for manipulating the money supply and gold was confiscated.  Gold was an alternative to the federal reserve notes.  Confiscating the gold further tightened the money supply (an alternative money).  (Fucking evil!)
            </p>

             Fast forward to today:
            </p>
            <p>
             The USG has been borrowing from the Federal Reserve system (that issues more money) and the value of the dollar has been propped up by monied interests. (More money issued, but private investors and other countries have gobbled up those dollars to hide the inflation.)  Now Americans are hooked on government subsidies and a particular quality of life.  (We're fat, happy, and ready for slaughter.)  If those monied interests refuse to buy up more federal reserve notes, the USG can borrow more from the Federal Reserve, but when the Federal Reserve now creates more money, we're going to see massive INFLATION because they're (the monied interests) are not going to back up those new loans.  (In 1929, the problem was DEFLATION.)  Most everyone understands what happens in massive inflation.  If you want an example of that type of economy, simply look to Venezuela for a recent example.

            <p>
             So the USG HAS to create a distraction (like they did in 1929) to blame for the economic woes.  Attacks on SA's oil infrastructure fits that bill.  "Hey everyone, the economy sucks because Iran attacked the oil supply, and now oil prices are destroying the economy!"  (Partly true, but not the whole picture.)  This might be followed by justifying war with Iran (which is what the monied interests wanted in the first place).
            </p>
            <p>
             The correct way out of this mess is to do away with the Federal Reserve and drastically cut the federal budget.  But no politician can pull that off without a massive political backlash.  Especially since everyone is hooked on government hand outs and thinks "free stuff" (Health Care, college tuition, Universal Basic Income) is what the government should be doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, basically, we're fucked and don't know it yet.  (Or if you do, you're preping to get the fuck out of dodge or hording food and shit.)

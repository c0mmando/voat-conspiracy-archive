<h2>Deep State Six: Non-Violent Collapse</h2>
<p>We sent 100,000 manufacturing plants to China since 1990. Each plant had 1,000s of jobs. All we have left are tertiary and service workers. Long before the tertiary sectors goes down, the service sector goes first. First the malls, then the offices, and finally the power plants. </p>
<p>But, it doesn\'t stop at malls, soon all financial bricks and mortar bank offices will be gone along with all the A.T.M. cash machines in your neighbourhood. Even the loan offices will shut down as services migrate online. </p>
<p>This is happening while all institutions are corrupted. Taxes used to pay for Health Care not Health Profit, defence meant No War not World Terror. We are paying taxes to starve millions in Yemen so we can make money making arms. This is a money-death cult. Without Deep State Collapse earth will die. </p>
<p>When millennials hit their 30s they will forget the Bernie Sanders daze and the Deep State will win again unless their defeat is decisive and complete, otherwise millennials will intensely regret their lack of action. They will end up as drunks like me.</p>
<p>To defeat the status quo, you have to have a self-organizing automated online barter system based on open source e-credits. So, instead of hiding money off shore, we know exactly how much money there is all over the world. </p>
<p>Gold is no good because it\'s not as tradable as online credits. Gold can\'t move at the speed of light like 100% private carbon tax credits can. This means we can destroy the war tax and privatize the carbon tax to counter the Deep Six our planet is going into.</p>

            It's weird that the most plausbile reason didn't make your list.  People don't understand that China is more inwardly focused than the west is.  China would use this as an excuse to consolidate their power, eliminate opposition,  and solidify the authority of the police state. The quarantine conditions enable them to label troublemakers and dissidents as "infected" and haul them away to be murdered and disposed of in a remote location and then claim that they died of the sickness while leaving no witnesses to claim otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            When a totalitarian state murders someone that opposes them it breeds resentment and creates more support for the views of the dead person. When a virus murders someone the states hands are clean. It can also help unite the people in a shared struggle against the disease. The timing fits too because since it was Chinese new year a lot of people had weeks off of work so the loss of productivity is less than if it had hit in the middle of summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously the virus has to be real enough and widespread enough to kill lots of non-dissidents and to discourage no suspicion that it was all orchestrated by the state.

                  Yeah. I haven't heard anyone explain how or why the government officials would know that somebody at that address is sick and needs to be picked up. The best legit rationalization that I can think of is if somebody else who lived there had gone to the hospital and tested positive, so the cops went to that address and hauled everyone else away to a separate quarantine center.  If that is the case then I don't think we'd be able to get confirmation of it until after this all blows over and any survivors are allowed to share their experiences.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If there's no survivors though, they could just as easily tell the cops someone was exposed and needs to be picked up. Even if they don't want to go as far as to put someone in front of a firing squad, they could just pick them up and haul them away to another location where other sick people are and increase their chances of getting the virus for real.

            I've been hearing about Bill Gates and the Pirbright group theory more lately, and it seems to make some eerie sense.. He has lots of stock in pirbright, which are the owners of the copyright on coronavirus (yes fucking VIRUSES can be copyrighted).. Just 3 MONTHS AGO bill gates some how predicted that there just might be a coronavirus outbreak....wow what a lucky guess.. The virus only seems to mainly target asians, so bill doesn't have to worry about him self or his own country.. He has always been a big proponent of eugenics, and he has always believed the world needs to solve its over-population problem.. Then, he gave $9 million to Inovio labs to "create a vaccine" for this coronavirus outbreak.. SUPPOSEDLY they created a vaccine in THREE HOURS (seriously look it up).. Do you think that's a little fucked up?.. They probably had the vaccine long before they even released the virus in to the middle of china.. bill and his pirbright stand to profit MASSIVELY for eternity from this because they will push to make their coronavirus vaccine mandatory for all new-born babies for the rest of eternity..
           </p>
           <p>
            THAT is a much more convincing conspiracy theory than "china released a super virus on them selves".. Reports have said china doesn't even have the capability to create a virus that advanced, and that only 3 places in the world has the advanced bioweapons technology to create a virus like novel coronavirus (USA, russia, and israel)..

             It's a good theory and the 201 simulation a few months ago is the kind of coincidence we can't overlook.  There were Chinese working at the lab where the virus was supposedly stolen from.

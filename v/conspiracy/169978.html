            I'm familiar with ideas like gradualism. But many of the claims being made are clear cut claims: e.g. is martial law active? Does the 2016 election occur on time? Do any US cities get nuked? (All of which I've heard as claims either here or back on the reddit subreddit of the same name). These are clear cut, and so if people are going to make them, they are opportunities to make testable predictions.

            I like humans making testable predictions. Specific predictions which have definitions so one can then tell if they are right or wrong. Otherwise, there's nothing to prevent people from keep saying something is going to happen
            <em>
             real soon now
            </em>
            and keep delaying it, and never realizing that their model is just wrong. So, my general approach is for people of all sorts of beliefs to try to get them to make specific predictions and then see how much they actually believe what they are saying by offering to make a bet with them. This is an excellent way of seeing how seriously people take their beliefs and helps all of us behave more rationally.

              Oh man, I'm definitely not pulling an Alex Jones or some other prophetic armageddon bullshit. I definitely don't think this is a "sign" or any other such end time thing. I was thinking more along the lines of social engineering. Kinda get the impression there is a narrative being built here to make big changes or whatever might have been unthinkable years ago, thinkable. Maybe just a gut thing, I just can't help but thinking with all the "oppression" BS being spewed by all sides, something is gonna pop.

            Creating 'honey pot' scenarios that are more likely to goad the more unhinged fringes and use the media to associate (even if the similarities are vague) those individuals with less radicalized groups seems plausible. For the most part, you don't see a lot of Confederate flags in Texas. We have our own state-patriotism that satiates that aspect of pride. There are Texas flags all over my neighborhood, we're about 80% white/ 15% Hispanic and Asian/5% black.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jade Helm fiasco is just that- a fiasco. The Military does these exercises fairly often with absolutely no fan-fare, no bullshit. Those claiming the exercises are anything more than they are siphoning energy from real threats. There's no plausibly realistic scenario where the US Gov't would disrupt an economy as large as Texas for the sake of 'really I have no idea what the end game would be.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Jade Helm doesn't have shit on TPP when it come to matters that effect our state. TPP Goes through, Companies sue Tex for their NAFTA highway- and bam- we have 24 lanes of jobs moving south across the Mexican border. To add to that- the goods, services, manufacturing can by-pass Texas altogether.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have our own similar situation going on in Denton County. Folks voted to ban Fracking, business lobbied George Bush and the gang to nullify that vote at the state level- and viola- in the stroke of a pen Denton County lost managing control of it's mineral resources.
           </p>
           <p>
            All this confederate bullshit, all this Jade Helm bullshit- it's a slight of hand distraction to keep your eyes off the big swindle.

             Makes a lot of sense actually, I mean I wouldn't actually imagine that scenario (a violent takeover of an state). But a more likely passive aggressive one, using JH as the proxy for other means. And is true TPP is more threatening than a takeover scenario (because its actually going on and apparently its gonna happen), but it doesn't mean that JH could be a way to eliminate any civilian guerilla or groups that could be against FG, after all it would all be part of the exercises. And while is going on TPP can become a reality and people didn't stand a chance.

             Thinking about it, assuming everything is coordinated, this gay marriage legalized nationwide  thing is just another distraction from the TPP going through the camera of representatives. And we have become part of the machinery, we us previous reddit users, If you go there right now there are at least 5 post about the legalization of gay marriage and a AMA of a monsanto scientist, back then when SOPA was going Literally everyone and their mom knew about it, and  fuck it was stopped at that time, but now its different and apparently its just going to happen and nobody cares at all

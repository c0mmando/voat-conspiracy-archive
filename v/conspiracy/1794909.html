<p>It\'s important not to waste it by doing nothing. And conversely, it\'s good not to waste it by doing pointless things as well. What things are worth doing? What things are worth <em>not</em> doing? </p>
<p>There is a lot of energy being put in to fixing the world. People care a lot, they just care about the wrong things. People ready to latch on to a movement that aligns with their goals are capable of being mislead by a powerful person who signals the right virtues in the right way.</p>
<p>Are we really doing what we want with our time? Is this really who we are? Will the repercussions of our actions leave a good mark upon human culture? Will the echoes of our every action help the people around us? What exactly are we doing in full, and why? </p>
<p>Are we truly expressing ourselves, or are we just jumping from one culture or counter-culture to another? Are these cultures organic or artificial? There are so many traps in our modern world. Traps to change our spending habits, our ideologies, our feelings about the world. To change our behavior and our voting patterns. We are in an avalanche of words and opinions. It\'s so easy to get swept away if you let your guard down. We get exploited in this way, just like the democratically voted anti-corruption law passed in South Dakota, that was overturned by emergency measures put in to place ot overturn the law, which I was quite upset about. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/658o42/the_people_of_south_dakota_democratically_pass_a/dg8kosv/">Until I found it it\'s actually funded by billionaires anyway.</a> I got swept up in a story of revolution.us, but it was seeming as though it was just billionaires using a cool meme to push power-grabbing legislation through.

<p>Man, I have this feeling we\'re going to be tricked in to thinking we did the revolution, but it\'s all money driven. It\'s like that Pepsi ad, but for real, and we believe it. Damn it.</p>
<p>It seems like any time a revolution gets momentum and starts getting big, then big money swoops in and corrupts it and yanks it in this corporatist direction, while continuing to use the corpse everyone is attracted to, like some &quot;Weekend at Bernie\'s&quot; situation. </p>

<p>But it has to be a very calculated withdrawal, lest we get entangled in more traps. </p>
<p>Looking at the world, there will probably be a war coming that billionaires will drag us in to, which they will profit from via their military-industrial companies. And at the same time nations around the world are seemingly being deteriorated intentionally.

            This is how they plan to sell globalism, since the slow method didn't seem to work out well (e.g. Brexit, UN is a joke no one believes in). Some people think they're gonna fake an alien attack to push globalism. Idk if they can do that. Maybe they're destabilizing Europe to push their globalist solutions ("Oy see this invasion? The states did not protect you from the muslim invaders, let us take over, for your children's sake.").

            Yes and no. A ruler only has power because the people enforcing his rules think so (and because he can pay them with the currency he took from the rest of the people with his thugs).
            <br/>
            So while they are taking away our currency automatically, they will be able to use it to bribe some part of the population to dominate the rest.
            <br/>
            However, those two parts of the population are in a huge disproportion. There are so few soldiers and policemen relative to citizens, that if every citizen stopped giving a fuck about the state and ignored it at the same time, the state would cease to exit within a month or so. This would work especially with a heavily armed populace and maybe less so with a disarmed populace.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, how are you going to wake up so many people when they get fed statist propaganda their whole lives?
            <br/>
            Even red pilled people can fall in line out of fear.
            <br/>
            What needs to happen is for the paid thugs to stop giving a fuck, and that's hard since the state is part of their identity.

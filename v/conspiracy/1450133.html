           The eugenics angle ties in to the globalist agenda more than the satanist one. After all, the globalists want a perfectly engineered global society. So making "better people" would be on their agenda.

           It also explains western foreign relations in the third world. It is always "birth control", and never about improving their economy. We never build their industries or help them take advantage of resources, it is always "limiting birth rates", and the birth rate being too high is always considered a negative thing.

            Well my comment was absolute sarcasm obviously.

            But this angle does make sense. Especially when you factor in the other aspects of their political platforms. Many of which deconstruct the idea of the nuclear family. Without family, descendants, to pass accumulated wealth and knowledge to then the individual's life has less meaning to themselves. Less ambition, shorter term goals, expendable wealth and expendable life even to one's self. Without family there's no belonging to tribe. No tribe, no nation. No nation, no civilization. By destroying traditional sexual norms they are tearing out the literal foundation of a free and productive society. Removing all real motivations to better ourselves. We don't better ourselves for our selves. We do it for our descendants.
           </p>
           <p>
            How better to remove people from the world than to remove the reason they're there? Take that away and they'll remove themselves for you.

            I don't know much about Pizzagate, but how many children have been supposedly removed? Because if they want to remove bad genes from the pool, killing a few hundred children won't do much. Hell, killing a few thousands wouldn't be enough. If they truly wanted to eliminate the bad genes, they would push birth control(which they do), and sterilize them, maybe by putting something on the water. Unless they go on a systematic slaughter like in Nazi Germany, or they dropped nukes, killing children won't be enough.

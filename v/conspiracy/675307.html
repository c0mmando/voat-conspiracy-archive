            I have to admit, I came into this link ready to prove why, only to find out, I have no idea.  I have no evidence, I can't link you to articles, although there are many, but I'm basically only believing for the sake of believing and trusting the sources that I've read information about.  So, even I'm having doubts as to whether I should stop and get ahold of my thoughts first.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can tell you that there was a link on voat about the WTC Bombing of 1993, in which there was damming evidence that the FBI knew before hand about the bombing, had interacted with the people identified as being the bombers.  It was all very interesting, which lead me to finally go into those websites where you have numerous people talking about 9/11 and some facts that were not made known to the public, and some things that seemed very farfetched, to name a few, the passport on the plane that supposably disintegrated from striking the ground so hard leaving a big charred hole around the area.  The events of the WTC 7 and Barry Jennings, and his going missing.  The comparison of the towers falling to that of a controlled demolition, pilots speaking about how the planes mentioned would not have been able to make that direct impact because of maneurability and constraints of the planes said to have been used.  How the buildings structure was made specifically to be able to withstand plane crashings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly, the list of terrorists that claimed they were responsible for the attacks, naming them as dead from the explosions, when more than half of them were very much alive and confused in their own countries seeing their faces on the news.  There was so much to it that still doesn't make sense.  Oh and also how the only reporter to film Ground Zero had to escape to Argentina and is now wanted for supposably killing his first wife.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know what, whats my point?  Where is my point really?  What am I trying to say, it's really just lead me to believe that the official story of 9/11 isn't the truth.  Again what evidence apart from watching videos and reading articles about the events do I have?  I was literally just sitting down at my desk when searching.  So what ties has the US had with ISIS and it's groups that directly caused it's formation?  I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or see like this link on voat started around the hour.
            <a href="http://www.zengardner.com/admit-refuse-hear-problem/">

           <p>
            I don't know, is someone fucking with me?  It's still pretty clear on that video from what they are saying.

              I'm not sure about the Jew comment though, although I am pretty tired of jewish whatever comedies, and now they have them in football commercials.  It's just, I'm not going to like bar mitzvah's no matter how many times you say it.

              But I did want to ask, what did JFK want to install, accomplish, setup before the end of his term?  What was the need of killing him?  And who benefitted ultimately for it?

               JFK's father was very jew aware according to Benjamin Freedman. Check out JFK's secret societies speech where he mentions an international conspiracy, similar to Hitler's "international clique". The only ethnic group truly international in nature is the jewish people:

              </p>
              <p>
               JFK wanted to end the Fed which gives the jew power over US purse strings and ensures the US stays a slave to Israel ultimately due to how it is ran and staffed. He was making moves on the fed according to his father:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                "First, some background: in 1994 this author’s book, Final Judgment documented—for the first time—a Kennedy family plan to move against the Fed, outlined by JFK’s father, Ambassador Joe Kennedy, in a private meeting in 1957 between the ambassador and a friend of mine, international businessman DeWest Hooker, an outspoken critic of the Fed."

               Israel wanted nukes. JFK was stopping that. He's dead. Israel also did 9/11. Half the us government are dual Israeli citizens. The other half are blackmailed child molestors controlled by mossad/CIA. Look up ry Dawson on YouTube. War by deception is an epic intro into what is REALLY going on in the world today... "War by deception" is a documentary on YouTube.

              <p>
               /edit Also there's pix of John McCain and the Isis leader all over the place. And evidence that the Isis leader is an Israeli actor. Plus, they caught an Israeli Isis general who confessed to all of it.

            It all started in Afghanistan. Russia was fucking them up with helicopters and some people in the US government went over and supplied ground to air missile's to take out the Russian helicopters. These people were the mujahideen. They included the CIA asset mr Bin Ladin. However you spell his bitch ass name. Anyways... Mr Tim Osman the CIA asset and his PC Brahs (Phaggot.Cunts) formed Al Que sauce. Al Que sauce eventually moved into Iraq after Bushski went into Iraq and hung Saddam for talking shit about his dad. Al Que Peso Sauce then became Alque Peco Sauce in Iraq. Then after the muslim Obama bin Americao said 'lets leave iraq' they all formed into isis and cut off your head.

            I agree, would it take religion for you to want to kill a motherfucker if drones had claimed the lives of your family members. I don't know how I would react, but im pretty sure I would do whatever I could to subvert the government responsible.

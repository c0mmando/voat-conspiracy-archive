            I've seen synthetic drugs lobotomize.  It's one of the best arguments for legalization.  Then it can be talked about open on the net and safety information shared and identification of who is safe and liability on manufactures if it isn't safe (because they'll be actual registered llcs who aren't hiding their address and can be sued).

            I think China is just filling a demand.  Most of the chemicals people order in bulk from China are either not controlled or only very vaguely restricted under analogue laws.  Most of them wouldn't cause a fuss at customs which is why they are allowed through most of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sad truth is it's actually easier to get online and order a kilo of some synthetic shit than to find a strip of acid for most people.  People like to do drugs but nobody wants to deal with shady fuckers and cops so if they can click a few buttons and have it come to their door without the hassle of bitcoins and fickle darknet markets they will.  And if someone is able to fill that need at very little risk, why wouldn't they.  China has the infrastructure to produce it already in place and they never miss a chance to make a buck.  I think it's standard supply and demand but there could always be ulterior motives.

              We've already established that China is filling a demand. This article does nothing to lead me to believe they're doing it out of malice or for destabilization. China likes money. Drugs are cheap to make and high in profit. Simple. If they also get to cause a little chaos for us in the process I'm sure they don't mind but I highly doubt the main motivating factor is anything but profit.

             Dang near every independently owned gas station trying to compete with the oil franchise or local monopoly tend to have no qualms providing a local easy to buy location. Head shops tend to draw to much unwanted attention and can get raided as they change and local laws catch up to it. They may close, most times things go by business as usual. Everyone looking for a way to make money all along the way.

            I'm not sure I'm with you 100% on this but it's an interesting idea. I think if China wanted it's money back they wouldn't be trying to put a strain on our government/society.

             10 years ago it looked like we would never be able to pay china off. Today as we piss through trillions yearly on paper alone, china and everyone else is preparing for the financial reset by buying tons and tons of gold as much off the books as on. China is not a fool.

            The problem with RCs is that they are RCs. The long term effects are not known. Some quickly get banned as analogues of known illegal drugs (the 2C family for example), some get through as they are unlike anything else (GBH etc).
           </p>
           <p>
            As for a Chinese attack, I find it hard to believe. I would suggest that the supply is solely because the drugs trade is profitable, massively profitable. RCs in particular used to come from Canada as they had laxer laws about such things. (Indeed I used to order 2CI from there)
           </p>
           <p>
            Occam's razor: Is Chinese government trying to destabilise the west using synthetic drugs (which in the case of opium is madness as natural opium is far, far easier to produce) or are a few enterprising Chinese seizing the opportunity to make a quick buck sending fake or watered down gear abroad?

             Yes I remember very well the boards with sites that were up over a decade ago. I remember Canada supplying very large portion of the RC market as well as pressed xtc pills cut with that supply of RCs until the people were ran out and arrested. I remember pills slowly becoming pipes or other rc anaolgs completely though while still dangerous from personal experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not remember china sized labs or any labs doing what china is at that size in Canada.

              China always ups the anti, they have a huge, cheap workforce and very flexible morals when it comes to the west. I am positive if you trace it all back, it would be making someone very very rich.

             Blaming China is such a fucking shill thing to do. Hurr-durr, the Chinese are tryin' to brainwash 'muricans! Bullshit. Just more divide and conquer tactics. If TPTB wanted drugs to placate the masses, they would have them that way- and frankly, we are getting there thanks to marijuana and the mental health benefits of psychedelics.

              Um what? That is like the opposite of what I said. I stated that the Chinese, if they are supplying loads of synthetic drugs, will be doing so for money. Nothing else makes sense. Chinese have good heads for business.

             This guys knows whats up (28C straight from Montreal, back in the days of SR). While profitability is a great argument, the reality is that there are far better capital investments available to the Heisenberg wannabes of the world, be it industrially cranking out ice or using $50 of stolen gear from the high school chem lab to extract LSA. This is especially true for the untested shit, given only morons or people with cash to burn would put major capital investment into something that could potentially be worthless. If it were that profitable, we'd be seeing more from South America.
            </p>
            <p>
             Labs that can make these sorts of synthetics also require a fair amount of specific material and equipment. The Chinese government is way too stringent on drugs (ie weed) and has far too large of a security apparatus to not be able to follow the breadcrumb trails. While I think it's unlikely they're directly orchestrating it, I have little doubt there are a whole lot of blind eyes being turned to the new revenue streams.

            I posted the above post on reddit and it was gone instantly. If someone else could try to get a similar topic up that would be awesome. I don't care that much but would be cool to know if the topic itself is the reason it came down and not my new account or something.

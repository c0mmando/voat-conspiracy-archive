<p>First, if anyone has additional information on Antarctica, feel free to post it because this stuff is fascinating.  
</p>
<p>Second, I have a theory about these &quot;potions&quot; they are discovering:  
</p>
<p><strong>Could they be a form of alien/demonic possession?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is how this could work:</strong></p>
<p>First, we need to have a working theory for \'free will\'.  Hume suggested that it is impossible to demonstrably prove the existence of \'freewill\'.  Kant, on the other hand, offered a suggestion to <em>infer</em> freewill (even though it cannot be scientifically proven).  
</p>
<p>Before we begin, if you don\'t have any understanding of these topics, here is an overly brief explanation: </p>
<p>Without freewill, humans are just robots.  These robot humans couldn\'t actually make choices, they are just programmed to feel like they are making decisions.  However, since it seems ridiculous to believe that humans do not make any conscious choices, we then assume some unknown accounts for our conscious decision-making process.  
</p>
<p>In ancient times, this process was called the human \'soul\', and that soul is what provides us with our &quot;humanity&quot;.  In other words: our body is not human; our body is merely a robotic vessel which houses our human soul.  
</p>
<p>In present times, we no longer say we have &quot;souls&quot; because that sounds religious.  Instead, we say we have &quot;freewill&quot; (a term that is more palatable for some).  In either case, they are the same.  
</p>
<p>Though for clarity\'s sake, it should be noted that the ancient greeks separated the unconscious mind (which makes programmed decisions) from the conscious mind (which makes conscious decisions), labeling one the \'human soul\' and the other the \'human spirit\').  thus, we arrive at the tripartite human, consisting of mind, body, and soul (or mind-body-spirit, or body-spirit-soul...depending on the terminology you prefer).  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But how does the soul function?</em>  
</p>
<p>Here is the theoretical concept via analogy: If one was to look at a radio and listen to the music it played, without understanding how radio waves operate, one would imagine that the music was coming from the radio, itself; however, once one understands radio waves, one realizes the music originated elsewhere, and the radio was just the vessel that generated the music which had originated elsewhere.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now,  freewill could operate in a similar fashion.  Although it is impossible for freewill to originate within our bodies according to the laws of the universe found within the 3-dimensional world in which we live, it is also possible that our freewill opperatesunder different laws and that the freewill is then transferred to us via some yet-to-be understood mechanism, and then finally it is generated within our bodies in a fashion similar to how radios operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But what does this have to do with Antarctica?</em></p>
<p>Well, these potions, could be interfering with this yet-to-be understood mechanism, and thereby, interfering with one\'s freewill/soul.  Worse still, not only could it interfere with freewill\'s signal, but it could actually be allowing access to a foreign signal.  Or in other words, these bacteria/viruses could be &quot;changing the radio station&quot; in our body (so to speak)...which is to say: it is removing one\'s freewill and replacing it with the freewill of another being.  If we are to understand \'freewill\' as one\'s spirit, then what looks like an &quot;infection&quot; is really a \'spiritual/demonic possession\'.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or in other words: by infecting people with these unknown viruses found in these potions, we are actually releasing demons from their imprisonment.  Moreover, by allowing us the opportunity to &quot;change the radio station&quot;, these viruses could also be the key to immortality, since they would allow particular spirits the ability to re-enter a living vessel even after the spirit\'s original body had perished.   
</p>
<p><em>This could be biblical.</em></p>',

            It has been demonstrated that our perception of agency is greater than our actual agency, by several reproducible experiments focusing on specific processes. However, you are correct in stating that proving agency is impossible, but that is not remarkable.

            Super interesting stuff. Love it. Find the second link a bit less believable though. Guy says they been friends for 50 years, putting his age in the ballpark of 60. Personally it’s hard for me to buy it given the style of writing. But who am I to say for sure. Thanks for the post!

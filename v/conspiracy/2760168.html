            Divide and conquer.  It may also serve as distraction/diversion
           </p>
           <p>
            Roll back the clock to 2013 or so.  Libertarians were siding with liberals and there was talk uniting to fight government corruption, while ignoring the big/small government debate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, the "leftists" are going bonkers against trump and the libertarians are aligned closer to conservatives based on issues of freedom.  While the liberals (not leftist) are empationed by the "leftists" to hate Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, the Kavanaugh ordeal looks like a contrivance.  But the whole election cycle is also bonkers/circus like.  Probably because society was on the path to revolt.

            Three things happened late last week while this circus had everyone's attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            They quietly closed the Russian probe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump sign a $834 billion spending bill.
           </p>
           <p>
            They quietly closed the Las Vegas shooting investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, it was all a distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too lazy to find sources so this is from memory over the last few days.

            The entire government is a show. Voting doesn't matter. Trump doesn't matter. Kavanaugh doesn't matter. All wars are pre planned 5 - 10 decades in advance. And there is nothing physical that anyone can do about it to stop it or change it to make it better than what it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those that run the show are satanic luciferians who practice black magick and engage with demonic occult spiritual beings. In addition they have access to technology that is thousands of years ahead of what you or I have access to.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only way they can enjoy sex is if it is mixed with murder and for some the only way they can orgasm is if a murder of a baby or small child is included in the sexual act.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have no conscience, no morals, no qualms, no shame, and no guilt. And would murder you just for the fun of it not even to get anything out of it. They are demon possessed psychopathic baby murdering cannibal rapist.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has been going on since ancient times. The government of the ancients and the governments of today are run the same way with the same 13 families in charge for ten and thousands of years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The united states government is barely 200 years old. It is not infallible. It is not invincible. These people create, grow and collapse governments on demand and right on que. They have no loyalty to any nation or state.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are only loyal to satan. They don't think in terms of nation or country. They think in terms of power and control. Chaos and destruction.

             There is no way to fight the system to make it right. This material world will always be an unhappy place, on account of our separation with God, Lord Sri Krishna. The only way is to escape the matrix. Learn how to do that here -

            It was an easy way to bury the Russian probe and draw the attention elsewhere. If anything its just another thing for the populace to fight over so that divide and conquer continues. The real news, whats actually happening would break the fucking Earth.

            I think the world makes a lot more sense if you assume that all of the political issues being pushed this hard in mainstream media are just theater.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is little reason that the powerful people in government, in MSM, in finance, or in academia would want the general public to know the details of how power structures are being built, protected, or destroyed.  Often, it would be a detriment to them.  But these industries underlie all of the main channels of information to the public, so instead we get a big dramatic circus to obsess about, the exact same way we obsess about blockbuster movies and hollywood celebrity lives.  It keeps us busy, and it makes us feel involved while having no actual effect on the direction of our societies.
           </p>

            Kavanaugh is going to sit on the Supreme Court.  And no matter what this does to the reputation of the Democrats or Republicans, no matter how it might effect elections, we will still get: insurmountable debt placed on the heads of our descendants, more and more dependency communities being built to justify more government intrusion in personal lives, just slightly fewer freedoms than we had last year, and more money and weapons and blood to uphold Israel.

            But it probably won't even effect the election results that much.  Once this event is done, it will quickly blow over when we're given the next dramatic situation to be outraged or hopeful about.  Some side will be sure that some important figure is about to go to jail, or that some aspect of the government is about to fall, or that we'll get some proof to let the public really see all of the corruption and manipulation going on.  Very few people will notice that this will never happen, because by the time it is predicted to arrive, we'll have gotten the next drama and next set of promises to obsess about.  And we'll be told to have patience, to trust in the plan, to have faith in some savior figure.  It's all about to start going down next week, you know, so just wait.

            Obvious psyop, yet even the people who know we're being manipulated and lied to will mostly play along.

            It's an interesting time in history.  I wonder how it will turn out.

            whilst ignoring your loaded labels on both Trump and Kavanaugh and sounding like maybe you need to read more..
           </p>
           <p>
            the original accusations more of a show by the dems to smear him.. if anything was even close to a show on the trump side it was how Flake tricked dems into agreeing to an FBI investigation that in the end would end up backfiring.. and this investigation will end later today.  they should vote for him Wednesday.. then the REAL show will start approx Thursday with release of FISA docs and possible other classified documents exposing corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            the use of CIA Dr Ralph Blasey's daughter by the Democrats in order to frame the judge has failed.  their illegal leaking and money trails will bite them in the ass.  show is over.
           </p>
           <p>
            still makes me laugh that people still think Trump is some sort of compromised hack.  but it is what it is.    the truth is stranger than fiction.

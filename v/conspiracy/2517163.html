             It was like a weird thick plastic semi circle that used to project out of the crease between the cartiledge of the lower part of the ear and what looks like from a chart to be called the external auditory meatus.
            </p>
            <p>
             After that was gone I notice a bump rises in the same spot kind of at the top of my parietal bone. It will be there for a week or a few days and just disappear. I will pick at it and scratch at it. Then it will be perfectly smooth again, but I will go through a period of communications and it will return.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the second one, which I still seem to have, it strikes me that the bump is from accessing it like a port. IDK.
            </p>
            <p>
             All I know is it is related to communications I have access to [not necessarily the thing allowing the communication, but maybe just the fact that I can communicate in this way] and that those communications have occasionally given me very important prescient knowledge - I think to assure me that I wasn't going crazy.

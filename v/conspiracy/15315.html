<p>Lately I have spoke up to two separate mods who each have a dominating power control on a broad topic verse, both offering rejection towards anything that doesn\'t abide by the story of their systems. They have on multiple occasions rejected any alternative aspects regardless of the intellectual idea, and have labeled all conspiracy-related talk as nothing but made up stories. Instead of development on the open discussion, they have avoided any talk on the subject and instead decided to make fun of it. I come here today to offer an open discussion on the issue that I feel these particular individuals don\'t seem to be fair as moderators, and the awareness of it is at a low. Every comment offering some rational response has fallen prey to downvotes in conversations where they only participate in (mostly together).  Since I have offered ideas to help minimize abuse, they have voiced against it and used discriminatory words to discredit anything I have said. I have now watched in the short moments since their recent activity a very large increase of negative voting against the comments I offered towards them. I cannot acuse them of downvoting as that is not my dilemma, it is the attitudes of such individuals in control. I have kept a civil and fair approach, and would like to hear some outside input, particularly from the folks who have experienced such behavior before or can maintain a rational conversation on the matter. </p>

            Honestly dude, you're coming off as a petulant little child who's not getting his way so you're crying to the admins.  A user who sets up a subverse can run it how he or she sees fit, whether you agree with it or not.  I think you're being pretty ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I don't like the way a subverse is run, I stay away from it and go to an alternate subverse.  It's called being a mature adult.

            Well visa vi your examples I dont see huge issues, sure that one guy was being a dick about his rejection of some common conspiracy theories, but the work you put into that second post was thumbed up by Atko, the og admin haha, and the people disagreeing, were just enjoying some open discourse on the matter, everyone wont agree man, keep the conversation moving! dont be bogged down because people have opposing views!!

            I think moderators should rule with an iron hand. There aren't an army of shills anyway, it's all tickety-boo.

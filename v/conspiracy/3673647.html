<p>One Arrested, Second Still Sought For Columbine Threats</p>
<p>From NewsHawk Inc. &lt;hawkeye@saber.net 12-17-99</p>
<p>No sooner was 18-year-old Michael Ian Campbell of Cape Coral, Florida arrested by the FBI at his home Friday, charged with making an Internet threats of an impending massacre at Columbine High School such as occurred there last April, then Colorado\'s U.S. attorney Tom Strickland disclosed that other similar threats regarding the school were currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Campbell\'s threats were frightening enough for school authorities to cancel classes at Columbine for two days.</p>
<p>Strickland said Campbell was arrested for &quot;transmitting in interstate commerce a communication containing a threat to injure another person;&quot; adding that the arrest &quot;should send a strong message that threats, especially against our schools, will not be tolerated.&quot;</p>
<p>Even though Strickland then noted that other threats against the school had been made and were being investigated, he refused to comment further, which would indicate that the ongoing investigations have yet to yield tangible results.</p>
<p>Comforting, isn\'t it?</p>
<h2 id="md-maybe-parents-ought-to-just-stop-sending-their-children-to-the-place.">Maybe parents ought to just stop sending their children to the place.</h2>
<p>They\'re really getting into the holiday spirit at Columbine High School in Jefferson County, Colo. The school has been shut down for two days because of threats posted in an Internet chat room, apparently warning of a military-style attack such as occurred at the school last April 20; involving numerous gunmen, lots of weapons and over SIXTY pre-placed explosive devices.</p>
<p>This is now like about the EIGHTH time there have been some serious, disturbing incidents involving threats made or actions taken by certain students (OSTENSIBLY, anyway) at Columbine High since the 1999 fall semester commenced--which have included threats of violence and mayhem scrawled/painted on school walls; posted on the internet, and issued directly to other students &amp; faculty in at LEAST one case. This latest incident would seem to be the most frightening so far.</p>
<p>It\'s funny... we THOUGHT that the FBI, the Jeffco Sheriff\'s Department and just about every other government &quot;official&quot; in sight--along with the vast majority of dog-on-a-leash mass media outlets--had proclaimed that Harris and Klebold &quot;acted alone&quot;--without the aid, assistance or complicity of one single other person on the face of the earth; despite, for one example, the utterly contradictory statements made by Jefferson County top copper John Stone--who\'s publicly claimed on a NUMBER of occasions that in his view, based upon such FACTS as the vast quantities of materials used in the April assault, there is no doubt whatsoever Klebold and Harris MUST have had help--to put it mildly--in executing the logistically complex commando attack on Columbine High last April 20, 1999.</p>',

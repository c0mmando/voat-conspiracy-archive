            Do what they ndo. Make a big deal. Ask for a manager next time. In front of her tell the manager what happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            And than tell them what you told us.
           </p>

            You will be ordering online.

           <p>
            From my own experience, the towns I visit, typically if a new place to eat opens or a store, the first month it's all white. Later they replace each staff member with a black dindu. The same thing you described happens in each store. Guess how many remain open for a year afterwards? Practically none.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you stop going it may not be effective. Hell they may even pay the!selves on the back and claim they doing a good job and you're just racist...
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell the manager youll be buying online.

             I'm not going to be bullied by anyone. I already informed the manager. I'll go elsewhere and start ordering on line because I prefer peace over conflict. I don't care what anyone claims. The diviisive rhetoric is just that and I won't be a part of it.

             I didn't keep quiet. You obviously didn't read the comments. And if anything, I'll be buying several acres in an even more remote area in a red county so me and my own can be left the hell alone.

            The town I grew up in used to be like 90% white. We have a very Christian college so that is probably why around there. They get a scholarship or a free travel to the USA to go to college. Then drop out.

            I went there recently and was surpsied to see how many migrant workers there are now. Used to be just white tweakers now it's like obedient migrants.

            This is COINTELPRO. It's the modern iteration of what has long been called a "low intensity operation." The Jew-black Alliance trains the filthier sorts of people to engage in this behavior towards high caste whites or goy intelligentsia. How to perform god awful customer service is studied and refined by ZOG. I'm under 24/7 surveillance -- gangstalked-- I'm a  recipient of this stuff on a permanent basis. "She misheard" ? Nope. You're mistaking malice for stupidity. The entire catalog of Communist Conspiracy literature is filled with nothing but examples of situations in which conspirators try to explain malice as stupidity. It's fuckin malice, bud, not stupidity.

               If I search for the keywords you just gave, will I find information on this intelligence operation? In the past, I signed up for a mind development course. I was very good at it. So good, in fact, that one of the teachers of it came to my home,( I was young so thought nothing of it at the time,) and he did some NLP work on me that didn't work.  However, soon after I had some very bizarre happenings in my home. I'm very healthy. I wasn't and am still not a drug user or drinker. I've always been very alert. But something strange happened after that class and his visit. I would later learn on my own about some " technology" that could be used on people and that this course was affiliated with the CIA. Furthermore, I've always had an acute awareness of my surroundings and my intuition is spot on and has kept me alive through many precarious moments in my life. Consequently, I'm very interested in what you have to say.

                Well, I don't think of it as "an intelligence operation made me a target." The jews made me a target. You can get sanitized information on the Army Counterintelligence Corps (there's even a book we have at my house that I consider watered-down propaganda:
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Army-Counter-Intelligence/dp/0531150976">
                 https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-Army-Counter-Intelligence/dp/0531150976
                </a>
                )
               </p>
               <p>
                As far as resources online on the gangstalking program. I don't cannonball right into the pool with those. There's some stuff I see and like, other stuff I don't. I believe that COINTELPRO was expanded rather than shut down; it focuses on finding ways for non-whites to mistreat whites and aid in white genocide however possible. I've wondered if I get V2K, but I'm not sure, and electronic weapons -- or what you say, "technology" -- is not something I worry over.
               </p>
               <p>
                It occurred to me after my first comment that ZOG focuses on captive markets when they're doing these customer service operations. I thought of your small town--there might not be a competing you could frequent.

                There was also a story in the NY Post a week or two ago about a woman cop involved with a low intensity operation. Her story is very similar to yours. Here's that link:

                 Thank you for all the links; I'll look into them!
                 <br/>
                 Btw, What does it mean that you're a white genocide guinea pig for Israel? Why would they target you? Do you have information they want concealed? And as far as the " technology " I experienced, it was just strange and it linked up with the mind development course or mind control course I would later find had a link to CIA. However, the technology didn't scare me nor was I fooled by it. So it's not a concern for me today. It's just something I experienced and aware of. As far as competing grocery stores where I live, there are very few here. But the one I went to, very few people go to because it's more expensive to buy all food stuff. I go there because it's no hassle. Because of that, I'm willing to pay extra. I'd like to add one thing. Where I'm at very few people live. But recently we had a " protest" here and over 200 people showed up! I left for another remote state nearby as soon as I heard about it because I was worried about fires if the protest turned violent. There's very few ways in and out of this small town It's very remote. So the protest here also seemed very odd.

                   Why you? Why Israel? I'll have to look into this Pacific Theatre and pre- CIA intelligence to understand further I suppose. Sorry if I sound inept regarding this. I'll look into it. Again, thanks for all the information. Be safe..

             I did go to the only manager there that day. When I explained what happened the manager quickly made an excuse for this new employee. However, that's when I asked my young daughter to SHOW the manager what she did. Only then did a lightbulb appear to click on and she said she would address it with the other manager when he got back .

              i complained about a black guy at kash n karry once. When I asked for the manager a black guy came out. i explained to him that I had decades of customer service experience and that I did not appreciate rude service from anyone. He acknowledged my experience and i could tell by his body language that he took me serious.

               I didn't get the impression the manager took my words seriously. That's why I had my daughter SHOW her what their new employee did. It's frustrating because I just want to be left alone in peace. I'm not one to make waves but I could tell it scared my daughter. Glad it worked out for you .

            it's your town, don't let them take it from you. i don't normally recommend this but if they act like that complain to their manager. they are counting on your White niceness and their brown privilege for that not to happen. if enough people do it then the management will have to address their bad hiring decisions

            <p>
             Every time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Teach your kid how to handle rude service employees by standing up for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bullies count on the fact that you won’t speak up and embarrass them, they want to keep it quiet, less witnesses to corroborate your side of the story. So make it loud and proud every time.
            </p>
            <p>
             If not, you’re just creating a monster. If you stop going to that store, it will serve as a constant reminder that you let a service worker own you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hopefully the way I worded this pissed you off enough to where you won’t take shit next time.

             Yes definitely let the manager know exactly what happened.  Reminds me of a new middle school that opened in the country and the blacks complained it was unfair despite them having one built a couple of years earlier.  The county decided to bus the thugs out to the school and they were complete delinquents.

             I did complain to one of the managers and I'm not one to complain. I usually mind my own business but her attitude was disturbing. I let my young daughter show the manager how the new employee threw our salad at us. At first she made an excuse for her behavior and admitted she was doing so. However, after my young daughter showed her what this employee did she said she would talk to the other manager above her. Incidentally, I went back today, reluctantly, and maybe it was her day off, but I saw they hired another diversity hires. Again, this is a small town; I've never seen these people. Just seems odd given the negative political environment recently.

              that was my best advice, good luck man

             <p>
              i'm guess the owner might be a woke liberal that's trying to give those opposed minorities a leg up, but idk

             <p>
              eventually when their employee keep showing up late, stealing from them, and pissing off customers they might hopefully reconsider

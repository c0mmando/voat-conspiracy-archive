<p>transparency is important moving forward in any given circumstance with the amount of lies and corruption over the hundreds if not thousands of years.   conspiracy theory is a term created by CIA to denounce people who did not believe in the narrative.. yet we constantly live in a world where conspiracy theories are fact and constantly fluid.  usually they are or crumbs of them are.  whether you want to believe or not.. it may be very telling 40 years on now looking back on these pictures which could be the first time a president has given a clue or a sign about what is to come.   if you have known or ever researched anyone who works in intelligence agency.. they will always tell you that there is no such thing as coincidences.  everything is planned.. everything has a reason.. nothing is on accident.  i believe as trivial as a picture of a crowd is and everyone makes fun of him.. there is much more in this picture for us to look back on.</p>',

            Fundamentally wrong? Power-tripping? Occult necessity? Ego boost?
           </p>
           <p>
            No. There's a simple dynamic to this. Pedophilia MUST be illegal and widely despised because the whole game is a system of control. That's the stick. The point isn't that people don't get caught. The point is not that for Britain's biggest pedo case the police can say "whoops we lost the folder". The point is that the folder can be rediscovered at any time, and that the pedophile will be subject to the court of public opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The carrot is that people will supply you with children. Some portion of the kiddy-diddlers are probably only mildly interested.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gay connections worked the same way when gay was illegal. And, believe it or not, so did abortions. Abortion doctors had a ready piece of information on Hollywood stars. Every kind of prohibition creates another underworld.

            Power structure. When someone is fueled by greed and ego, whilst having 'everything' that money can buy... they need something out of reach. This is why many high profile 'elites' have a lust for young children for the fact it is illegal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most of them are on an ego trip just for knowing that they will get away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forbidden fruit is fuel for boosting ego.

            Kids still play cowboys and indians, it worked there. They could try and do it if they wanted to but it's much easier to just ignore the upset people and destroyed lives, they are massively rich and own huge parts of the country and industries, they can just pay an army of people to obscure the problem forever.

            The ones you talk about are a parasitic cult that worship Molok or just MLK. The current cult's origins can be traced back to at least 800 A.D. to Khazaria on the Black Sea, although the worship of MLK can be traced back before the common era. They consider themselves those who are owned by the Light-carrier Lucifer, which translates to Illuminati. However, they surrender their own light when they accept indenture. They consider much of what they do to be religious rites and ceremonies. As crazy as it sounds, pedophilia is the least of their evil. The reason they don't normalize their problems is that they neither need to nor would they consider their blood sacrifices as valuable if everyone were doing it. It's a pretty exclusive club they belong to and they don't like admitting new members. What I haven't been able to figure out is why they don't understand that death is only the beginning.

            For them, it is legal. Doing bad things and getting away with it, regularly? -Yeah, that's power tripping.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know it's happening. We know governments use it regularly. (Saville / Franklin cover-up).
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that it's happened several times we see the pattern: EVERY time it hit's the echelons of government: investigation gets classified,  or material witnesses begin to disappear..  They either die, or material is lost, or lost in plane crash..

            I've been researching this for quite some time - as in decades of time. I'm amateur, not some paid-per-show type or anything, but I have watched countless hours from people like Michael Tsarion's "Irish Origins of Civilization" to Joseph Campbell's "A Hero's Journey". I've read Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation of cuneiform tablets and studied Graham Hancock's idea of ancient gods. I could keep going, but it's irrelevant - your question was what I have found.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have found evidence from many sources that indicate humans were never alone in this universe, and only recent history has these non-human 'people' stopped contacting us. This is evident in historical documentation of prophets and demigods that were present and now seem to be quite absent. The idea is that these are humanoid species that originated extra-terrestrially - most pointing to the former planet that is now the Kuiper asteroid belt. These 'people' were giants - some reaching several stories high (like 30+ feet). These 'people' were descendants of another, even more ancient race called the 'ancient builder race' that engineered things like our moon (yes, it is an artificial satellite that is hollow). There was some sort of great war in which their planet was destroyed, creating the asteroid belt, and forcing refugees from this planet to flee. This was the origination of the ancient gods on Earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            These ancient peoples moved inwards - they created giant caverns and underground civilizations with technology they had left over from this war. From there they affect us by appearing in subconscious (like dreams and mind stuff) and in person as gods or supernatural beings. There is some sort of agreement that they stop interacting and let us figure shit out on our own, but this is allegedly coming to an end?
           </p>
           <p>
            On that note, it should be said that this is evidently one of many species of intelligent life not from Earth that has visited, let alone interacted or even guided our Earth-human development. These other 'races' have their own intent - some are not benevolent and some are extremely peaceful and really only want what is best for all of life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there is the AI (artificial intelligence) permeation that affects all things within this universe. Evidently, the idea with the AI is that it is sort of like an artificial god - god being the permeating 'intelligence' that all life displays - like self awareness and consciousness. This AI is an artificial source of this and the AI takes over entire systems in order to perpetuate itself. Very much like the Borg allegedly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, this is just what I've read and watched others talk about. I've read their books and the religious texts that are referenced and sourced, but have never been in some ancient underground cave or seen the entrance to Valhalla on Antarctica, so its up to faith really.

            There is a lot of intrigue surrounding supernatural conspiracies.  The first conspiracy I believed in was the Kennedy assassination, but if the US government was overthrown in a coup in 63, and the perpetrators never caught, then they are still active.  If they are active, I will always see supernatural conspiracies as calculated disinformation.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, there is compelling evidence for flat-earth/hollow-earth theories surrounding the exploration of Antarctica.  There are also some interesting interviews from people who claim to know about a secret martian colony and a base on the far side of the moon.  Then there are those like Laura Eisenhower who have such fantastic stories that I want to believe if they didn't sound so far out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still encourage everyone to question everything you've been taking for granted your whole life if just for yourself.  Is the world round?  Was Einstein right or just did he just have good PR?  Was the moon landing footage faked?  Unfortunately, I feel that while the results of a kidnapped electoral process are still en effect, as I believe they have been since 63, the truth will too far indistinguishable from science fiction as those who rely on the conspiracy have too much to lose.

              It's not a sphere. It rotating fast enough to be squashed at the poles and bulge at the equator. Plus if you have ever used a radio you know the earth isn't flat, why do you think we have so many towers if RF can go on infinitely? After 16 miles the curvature of the earth is to dramatic and the RF waves just go straight into space. Wicked!

               It's close enough to a sphere for me. I guess spheroid would have been more correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah, as far as radios are concerned, f layer ionization and grey line propagation pretty much prove it's a sphere. Oid.

             Ive always had a suspicion that there might be a dark moon base. For those who dont know, we only ever see one side of the moon, as it's day (axil rotation) is the same length as its "year" (orbital period).

              There is some compelling info out there that alludes to this. Some hacker found a list of Naval officers for space ships. I believe we have a lunar base, and I think we may even have a base on Mars, or are currently working on one.

               Plus, even if there is no military presence on the moon, the far side would be the absolute most ideal place for a deep-range telescope. When eclipsed by the earth, the moon is the darkest place we can currently get equipment of that scale. Realistically, a lunar observatory wouldn't even need to be manned.

               That would be absolutely amazing to see. It might finally put to rest a lot of the silly conspiracy theories about space being impossible to reach, flat earth, ect. Or hell, maybe it would prove them correct. I just want to see and end to all the arguing haha.

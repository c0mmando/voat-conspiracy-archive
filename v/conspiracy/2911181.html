            Just a couple of points to add. The UK, France, and China also did above ground testing. The UK in Australia, France in Algeria and the Pacific. Lots of people and animals got exposed to fallout in the Australian tests. Only the US, USSR, and China had enough empty land to do testing in their own back yard. Also, above  ground testing started before satellites existed. Sputnik was 1957.

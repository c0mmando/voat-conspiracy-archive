<p>A buddy of mine lives near Portland and says has seen a 10CPM increase in the Columbia River during the incident week. This really is not unusual but, was a noticeable increase. Bases readings tend to be around 7-19 CPM and during the first incident he was reading between 27-31 CPM. </p>
<p>Once again fluxes this small are really nothing to be concerned about. Only when we see readings jump 100+ CPM do things need to be taken a bit more seriously. If the site is leaking then even 5 miles outside the no fly zone, we should see an increased CPM reading. Don\'t know if anyone has done it yet but its probably time to fly a drone up with a Giger counter and start taking our own readings... </p>
<p>Radiation networks map has not shown that dramatic of increase. but there nearest recording station is east of Portland. They don\'t keep recorded data, which sad. I believe this webpage was originally built and set up during the Fukashima event, So primitive but useful radiationnetwork.com</p>
<p>I hope this is conspiracy enough to talk about here. This event could be Huge. The Columbia river is a vital part of the NW waterways. Anyone is in the Tri-Cities area or around the Hanford Site and has info to add, please do! Hope this discuss worthy!</p>',

<p>Why does this entail a consipracy ?

This is of course so that the real bad guys can slip through the cracks.

Emmanuel Malynski said it best when he identified the nature of the trick : Which is and was a unification of certain key factions (communism, feminism, and judeocaptalbankernepointernationalism - sensational but a good summary of a long book) This unification would result in world wide revolution and the implementation of a deathstate or global state of decay with the intention of one ruling class above the ashes etc...) To relate back to the initial claim of consipracy ie playing certain factions against each other, it is quite simple : while the deathforces listed above ally into one large faction they clearly want to impede their opposites from doing the same.

           I can't deny the obvious redirection of public angst away from most pressing matters and towards the general faction known as Islam. Consider for a moment that the strict rules imposed within the religion are nothing more than age old solutions to many of the same problems which currently plague the modern western/european societies of today.

            The Jews are terrified about us making an ally with Islam.  Outside of wahabi-ism I find Islam to be highly respectable, as did Adolf Hitler.  I especially hold high regards for Iran and Syria and other nations such as Indonesia and Malaysia, albeit I wouldn't choose to live in these countries.

Russia Identifies Las Vegas Shooter As CIA Arms Pilot; Israel Probes Stolen Weapons Flight To Nevada 
WARNING: This report contains graphic photograph of dead shooter Stephen Paddock</p>
<p>October 4, 2017</p>
<p>Russia Identifies Las Vegas Shooter As CIA Arms Pilot As Israel Probes Stolen Weapons Flight To Nevada</p>
<p>By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers</p>
<p>A stunning new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today states that based on documented evidence developed with the aid of both Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations (MOSSAD), the identity of the person named responsible for the “Pyramid Sacrifice” ritualistic massacre in Las Vegas, named Stephen Paddock, has established his being an arms smuggling pilot employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)—with further evidence being developed that the weapons and ammunition used in this massacre were likely stolen from an Israeli arms depot sometime during the past fortnight. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]</p>
<p>According to this report, the SVR has already identified this “Pyramid Sacrifice” as bring a “false flag” operation conducted by rogue elements within the CIA—and whose most noted past examples include the “Tower Sacrifice” of 11 September 2001, the “King Sacrifice” of 23 November 1963 and the “Child Sacrifice” of 19 April 1993—to just name a few—but whose latest massacre in Las Vegas is being marked with uncharacteristic sloppiness, said to be due to President Trump’s severe disruption of the “Deep State” that has long ordered these ritualistic murders to be conducted in order to fulfill their political goals.</p>
<p>In order for the CIA to protect itself against the American people discovering the truth about these ritualistic murders (like Las Vegas), and as the true facts about the “King Sacrifice” murder of President John F. Kennedy were beginning to flood into public view, this report explains, in April 1967 they released a secret memo on how to combat the truth from ever being known—and that for the first time in history introduced the terms “conspiracy theory” and “conspiracy theorists” the CIA instructed the US mainstream propaganda media to use in labeling anyone who came close to discovering the truth—and whose other orders included:</p>
<p>Claim that it would be impossible for so many people would keep quiet about such a big conspiracy
Have people friendly to the CIA attack the claims, and point back to “official” reports
Claim that eyewitness testimony is unreliable
Claim that this is all old news, as “no significant new evidence has emerged”
Ignore conspiracy claims unless discussion about them is already too active
Claim that it’s irresponsible to speculate
Accuse theorists of being wedded to and infatuated with their theories
Accuse theorists of being politically motivated
Accuse theorists of having financial interests in promoting conspiracy theories</p>
<p>Spearheading the CIA’s massive propaganda effort to label anyone coming close to the truth as “conspiracy theorists”, this report continues, was its notorious Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton—who firmly believed that his spy agency was in actual control of the United States, not the citizens of his nation who elect their leaders—and as he so arrogantly stated before the US Congress, in 1975, when he shockingly testified: “It is inconceivable that a secret intelligence arm of the government has to comply with all the overt orders of the government.”</p>
<p>Even too today, this report notes, the CIA controls all of the media in both America and among its allied nations—and as stunningly revealed last year by the noted German editor and journalist Dr. Udo Ulfkotte who said “we all lie for the CIA”—and who, also, was assassinated just hours before meeting then President-elect Trump where he was expected to reveal more information on how the CIA controls the media.</p>
<p>In spite of these CIA “headwinds” against the truth, though, this report says, the SVR can report with a high level of certainty that between the years of 1986-1988, Stephen Paddock was employed as a arms smuggling pilot in the CIA’s “Operation Cyclone” programme to arm and finance the Jihadi warriors, mujahedeen, in Afghanistan, with flights based from Pakistan—with Paddock being paid through an American defense company named AlliedSignal—a company that is now owned by Honeywell, but who, in 1982, became embroiled in the Martin Marietta “war”—with Martin Marietta eventually merging, in 1995, with Lockheed to become the United State’s largest defense company named Lockheed-Martin—and whose only statement on these facts states: “Stephen Paddock worked for a predecessor company of Lockheed Martin from 1985 until 1988. We’re cooperating with authorities to answer questions they may have about Mr. Paddock and his time with the company.”</p>
<p>As with other known CIA covert operatives, too, this report details, Stephen Paddock was continuously paid through US government entities such as the Internal Revenue Service and US Postal Service in order to maintain his “deep cover” status—and that generously allowed him to purchase properties in Texas worth over $6 million, and to maintain his private plane there too.</p>
<p>Stephen Paddock’s “deep cover” activities in Nevada, this report further details, are being described by the MOSSAD as his working with an FBI informant named Marilou Danley who was tasked by this American intelligence agency to report on Russian mafia persons living in Las Vegas—and who is now reported to be back in the United States under the protection of the FBI.</p>
<p>Among the covert “actions” performed by Stephen Paddock for the CIA while in Nevada, this report continues, was his brokering a deal with the Russian mafia to obtain a computer malware programme this criminal organization created—and that once obtained by the CIA, allowed them create their “Grasshopper” spying programme that allows its users to detect if a target device is running a specific version of Microsoft Windows, or if an antivirus programme is running.</p>
<p>The importance of the Russian mafia in understanding this “Pyramid Sacrifice” massacre, this report details, is that over the past decade they have flooded into Las Vegas in massive numbers—but not from Russia, but from Israel—where, since at least 1998, they have taken over the Israeli underworld.</p>
<p>So it was a “shock/surprise” this past week, this report continues, when MOSSAD recorded the arrival of “certain” Russian mafia figures at the just opened US Air Base located in the Negev Dessert—and who departed from there on a known CIA C-130 transport that had been there since 10 September—and that the Americans had claimed was due to “maintenance issues”.</p>
<p>Upon MOSSAD discovering this “linkage” of Russian mafia persons and the CIA, this report explains, the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) command ordered an immediate inspection of all arms depots—and who then shockingly discovered a massive breech in one of the emergency armories where a large quantity of military-grade weaponry and ammunition, including explosive devices, were discovered missing—and that included thousands of rounds of 5.56 mm diameter bullets—like those used during the “Pyramid Massacre” in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Most troubling about the CIA flight that left the US Air Base in the Negev Dessert, is that its destination was the Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada—and that was originally due to arrive there between 22-23 September—but due to its “maintenance issues”, didn’t arrive until a week later on 29 September.</p>
<p>The critical significance of this CIA flight being delayed for a week, this report says, is that it coincides with the actions of Stephen Paddock too—and who was preparing to carry out his “Pyramid Sacrifice” massacre last week upon the Life Is Beautiful Festival headlined by Lorde and Chance the Rapper—and as evidenced by his renting multiple condos from the Ogden 21-story luxury building overlooking this venue, and exactly as he had done a week later at the Mandalay Hotel.</p>
<p>To the CIA’s orchestration of the “Pyramid Sacrifice” massacre, this report continues, it shows an unusual level of sloppiness that even their propaganda media is having a hard time trying to explain—and includes:</p>
<p>Multiple reports and videos saying the shots came from the 4th floor, not the 32nd.</p>
<p>Australian Brian Hodge, who was staying in the room next to Stephen Paddock on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay, and who stated that there were multiple people dead and multiple shooters inside the hotel.</p>
<p>Las Vegas police confirming the testimony of Brian Hodge by their stating that Stephen Paddock engaged security guards in the hotel and shot one guard in the leg through his hotel room’s door.</p>
<p>Photographs of Stephen Paddock’s hotel room secretly emerging showing a maybe suicide note he left behind on a table—and his bloodied-head lifeless body too.</p>
<p>As to the stunning photos released showing Stephen Paddock dead, his room and his weapons, and from the most secure crime scene in America today, this report notes, shows it being done by President Trump who had them forwarded to his close ally Alex Jones of Infowars—and that SVR intelligence analysts state is part of the “game” of “narrative fixing”.</p>',

            The deep state had allowed 30 MS-13  Gang members into CA for a special job.
The Exercise in California was the military rounding up (some killed) all of these gang members. No I don't know what the specific job was the Gang was to carry out.

            CIA Pilot Linked To Las Vegas Massacre Blown Out Of Sky February 6, 2019

            US Special Forces Descend On Los Angeles After CIA Pilot Linked To Las Vegas Massacre Blown Out Of Sky
           </p>
           <p>
            By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers
           </p>
           <p>
            A mainly redacted “Of Special Importance” highly classified new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) circulating in the Kremlin today confirming the Ministry of Defense (MoD) assessment that elite US Special Forces have begun high profile arrest operations in Los Angeles-California, notes that this urban combat operation was begun within hours after a known CIA deep cover pilot going by the name of Antonio Pastini was blown out of sky—whose true name is Jordan Isaacson, and whom SVR intelligence analysts had previously identified as being one of the CIA pilots who flew stolen Israeli weapons and ammunition to Nevada where they ended up in the possession of CIA arms pilot Stephen Paddock, who is reported to have singlehandedly carried out the worst massacre in American history on 1 October 2017 when it was said he fired more than 1,100 rounds from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas-Nevada killing 58 people and leaving 851 injured—a feat of marksmanship too preposterous to believe as no single solider in any war in history has ever come close to matching such a death toll.  [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to this report, 8 days ago, on 29 January 2019, the specialized American intelligence unit of the SVR sent out an “Urgent Action Notice” requesting heightened surveillance of all known CIAoperatives believed to have been involved in the Las Vegas Massacre—and whose stated reason for doing so was based on their belief that “retribution killings” could begin because the FBI had just closed their case on this massacre with their concluding that Paddock’s motives remained a mystery to them—thus meaning that none of his co-conspirators would be brought to justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            As per standard operating protocols long established within the US intelligence community, this report explains, once a criminal CIA target and/or targets are deemed unable to have their crimes revealed to the public by normal prosecution procedures, and as determined by the FBI, they face non-judicial actions—that mostly sees them arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for made up sex crimes, but in some cases sees them being assassinated—one of the most infamous of them being the assassination of CIA drug and weapons smuggling pilot Barry Seals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of particular surveillance interest by the SVR noted in their 29-January “Urgent Action Notice”, this report details, was CIA pilot Jordan Isaacson—who was operating under his deep cover name of Antonio Pastini and was long associated with CIA pilot Stephen Paddock—both of whom were residents of the State of Nevada, and whose frequent flights between Mexico and Chicago-Illinois showed the CIA exchanging guns and ammunition for drugs—and was an arrangement deal worked out between the DEA and the Sinaloa drug cartel—leaving it no wonder why top Mexican government officials publically stated that the CIA manages the drug trade in their country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Four days after issuing their “Urgent Action Notice”, on 4 February, for increased surveillance on CIA pilot Jordan Isaacson, this report concludes, his plane was blown out of the sky over the Las Angelessuburb of Yorba Linda—and upon whose body was found a Chicago Police Department badge and retirement papers that would have allowed him to land there without being overly searched—and who, for 21-years after retiring and moving from Chicago to Nevada, freely posted to social media and granted media interviews telling of his time being a Chicago policeman—but upon whose death than saw the Chicago Police Department denying he had ever worked for them, and saying that the badge he had was stolen in 1978—with it further to be noted that even as his bomb out plane was still blazing on the ground, a US Navy P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft rushed into the air over Los Angles where it took up a circularly flying pattern at 20,000 feet remaining there for hours—until they were joined by elite US Special Forces troops who began a series of raids they masked for the public as an exercise—and whose explosions and gunfire continue to rattle the nerves of the citizens of this city.

            Kaspersky involved with this? Was Kaspersky knowingly or unknowingly working with Russian mafia? Did the Russian companies give their experience to the Russian mob or did the Russian mob just use their tech with out their involvement? Does this go all the way up to Putin?

            The missing LVPD captain who got rid of guns and evidence had to have got rid of the guns when he found out they came from Israel and found Russian mobsters finger prints on the weapons and found out about MLD and SP being FBI/CIA. They brokered a deal to get the malware but the deal was actually a sting but the Russian mob found out and did the shooting?

            So he was going to sell guns to Russian mobsters for malware and they found out they would be arrested the same time Saudi shit is going down so the Russian mob shot up the venue. Mossad was there in Vegas. Had to have been tracking the stolen guns and ammo.

            With “narrative fixing” being an intelligence directed propaganda action intended to “guide/instruct” public opinion towards whatever goal is trying to be achieved, this report explains, there are no shortage of examples being displayed, and that include:
           </p>
           <p>
            Las Vegas police reports saying that Stephen Paddock may have been radicalized.
           </p>
           <p>
            Confidential medical records being released stating that Stephen Paddock was issued a prescription this past 21 June by Henderson, Nevada, physician Dr. Steven Winkler for 50 10-milligram diazepam (valium) tablets that are warned could cause psychotic behavior.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other reports stating that Stephen Paddock transferred $100,000 to the Philippines where his associate Marilou Danley was staying.
           </p>
           <p>
            Marilou Danley reported to have 2 Social Security numbers and 2 husbands she was/is married to at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hotel receipts showing Stephen Paddock ordered room service for two people just prior to his opening fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephen Paddock equipping his weapons with a “bump stock” that’s designed to achieve rapid fire results on semi-automatic rifles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Semi-automatic rifles equipped with “bump stocks” found in hotel room of Stephen Paddock
           </p>
           <p>
            To the CIA’s motivation in their creation of this “Pyramid Sacrifice” massacre, this report continues, SVR intelligence analysts have determined is to place the blame of on ISIS terrorists in Iraq—with the end goal being that President Trump would be forced to enter into this conflict nearing its end tens-of-thousands of American troops.
           </p>
           <p>
            Greatly angering these rogue elements in the CIA, this report explains, was President Trump cutting off their secret funding to their terrorist forces in Syria—and whom Russian and Syrian forces are now annihilating by the thousands—but whose final demise is being hampered by the US—with the Ministry of Defense stating: “The main obstacle to the complete elimination of radical Islamic terrorists in Syria is not the military capabilities of these terrorists, but rather the support of our American colleagues.”
           </p>
           <p>
            To whom will win the “narrative fixing” war ongoing between the CIA and President Trump involving this “Pyramid Sacrifice” massacre, this report concludes, is not now knowable

<p>Honestly it started here, on voat. Someone posted something about the Berenstain Bears... but I VERY VIVIDLY remember Berenstein Bears. I didn\'t think much of it at the time. I just thought maybe they got a misprint, or maybe they printed different spellings to different areas. Or had gone through a trademark dispute and had to change the spelling of the name for whatever reason... either way I shrugged it off for the time being. </p>
<p>This topic has resurfaced but with way too many differences that I just can\'t shrug off anymore. Over all the vids I\'ve watched there\'s a lot of name brand things that seem to have changed over the years. I\'ve noticed some as time has gone by but just thinking they were &quot;re-branding&quot; or have had some legal reasons for having to change their name. Come to find out &quot;They\'ve always been that way&quot;.</p>
<p>I\'ve come up with a list of the ones that I can 100% &quot;remember&quot;.</p>
<p>The first being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Berenstein Bears.</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember as a kid this being the same as Frankenstein or Einstein, as those names are not common in my area.</p>
<ul>
<li>STAR WARS! </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; even James Earl Jones remembers it that way. I guess he now says &quot;No, I am your father&quot;.</p>
<p>C3P0 having a silver leg in the original 3 movies?!?! He was ALWAYS completely gold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mister Rogers Theme Song</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;It\'s a beautiful day in THE neighborhood&quot; but I guess he\'s only talking about his own now. &quot;It\'s a beautiful day in THIS neighborhood&quot; </p>
<ul>
<li>Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Mirror mirror on the wall&quot; I guess it\'s really just &quot;Magic mirror on the wall&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Forest Gump </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Life IS like a box of chocolates&quot; it\'s really &quot;Life WAS like a box of chocolates&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Apollo 13 (the movie)</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Huston we HAVE a problem&quot; but is &quot;Huston we HAD a problem&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Coca-Cola</li>
</ul>
<p>I remember the logo being&quot;Coca~Cola&quot; but I guess it\'s always been more along the lines of &quot;Coca`Cola&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>KitKat</li>
</ul>
<p>I always remember Kit-Kat</p>
<ul>
<li>Febreze</li>
</ul>
<p>When did they drop the E? &quot;Febreeze&quot; is how I remember it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oscar Mayer</li>
</ul>
<p>The second name is MEYER!</p>
<ul>
<li>Volkswagen</li>
</ul>
<p>There was NEVER a space between the V and W</p>
<ul>
<li>Volvo</li>
</ul>
<p>What\'s up the the &quot;male&quot; symbol? It was always just a circle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ford</li>
</ul>
<p>I never remember it having that weird loopy thing on the end of the &quot;F&quot;</p>
<p>The Mandela Effect list goes on and on, but these are the only ones (currently) I can verify 100% for myself. Now I\'ve heard a few different reasons for why this is happening, and the main stream reasoning are commonly vague (if not just out right saying you\'re crazy or need to lay off the drugs).</p>
<p>What are your Mandela Effects you can say for 100% certainty? Why do you think it happens?</p>
<p>TLDR; I remember things different than what they &quot;are&quot;, but I\'m not the only one. What do you remember different than what it &quot;is&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: Just thought of a couple more (the weird side effects of the Mandela Effect)</p>
<ul>
<li>Looney Tunes</li>
</ul>
<p>IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN &quot;Looney Toons&quot; (even &quot;Tiny Toons&quot; hasn\'t changed yet)</p>
<ul>
<li>Froot Loops</li>
</ul>
<p>As a kid I remember &quot;Fruit Loops&quot; I just thought they had to rename because there was no real &quot;fruit&quot; in the cereal. </p>

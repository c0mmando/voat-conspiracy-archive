            Lithium-ion batteries are garbage. They don’t work in the cold (and have terrible life even in cooler temperatures). They only get a thousand cycles before starting to lose peak charge. And the explode upon puncturing, so expect your car to explode when it’s hit or hits something.

            Worst part is that we don’t have anything better.

             <p>
              Yes. You’ll also notice that the pinnacle of human achievement was first created in 1960. Every piece of technology we have today is derived from something created in the 1960s or earlier. The Internet. Transistors. Modern rocket engines. Even nuclear fusion plants. All 60 year old tech or greater.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why?
              <strong>
               Multicultural societies don’t advance technologically.
              </strong>
              When everyone “hunkers down,” refusing to engage socially or work to improve the community, we see technological stagnation. After all, in a multicultural society, there is little reason to expend energy for the sake of others, because those others aren’t your kind. When everyone around you is of another race–another species–your subconscious brain knows that it is dangerous to the survival of your species for you to waste energy on others when it should be directed toward your own children. There’s no guarantee that a society made up of people other than yourself will want your children to survive, so your brain tells you that it’s counterproductive to support anyone but your closest relatives. Everyone else follows suit. No trust in society means no cooperation. No cooperation means no advancement.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews run society, but they aren’t interested in advancing the state of humanity. With every step forward comes the uncertainty that their power may collapse–that people may gain independence from them and control of themselves again. That’s not a unique psychological affectation, just a strong one. This is why the Internet was such a global upheaval and why jews have fought so long and so hard to control it. They’ve used everything from social engineering (to herd people like cattle into just a handful of websites, which they control) to draconian censorship laws (to govern what you can and can’t say online) to outright blocking or deleting entire websites (so that information which questions their power can’t be distributed). Why? Because the Internet was a step forward. It allows communication and the spread of ideas faster than the plans and control system of those in power. It was real progress, and as such it had to be stopped. The Internet has also reminded them of the necessity of controlling all speech. Without censorship of new ideas, progress is no longer stifled. Without total narrative control, their power slips and they may find themselves with their white enemies at their gates.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Instead of progress, they give us stagnation. The same thing, over and over, packaged in a new box so that it feels fresh to the masses who eat it all up.
              </strong>
              Derivative technologies. No breakthroughs. No leaps forward. No advancements. No extensions to lifespan. Meanwhile, they use government-sponsored monopolies to crush their competition. They use the body politic to stifle anyone who would willingly lose money on a venture for no more reward than the hope of spreading messages or spurring humanity along a bit. If the world remains like this, we will never see a cure to stop human aging or a meaningful extension to lifespan. We’ll never see human colonies on other planets. We’ll never solve the energy crisis by using fission and fusion nuclear power. We’ll never mine asteroids to save us from the scarcity of rare metals used in industry and technology.
             </p>
             <p>
              We
              <em>
               will
              </em>
              , however, soon see “full dive” virtual reality computer systems. They’re already spreading Hollywood propaganda in favor of this. Why? Because our reality is so terrible that people are screaming for any “escape” they can get. And since jews refuse to allow anyone to slaughter them and obtain true freedom, they offer prepackaged “freedom” in the form of a hedonistic virtual world where “you can do anything”… Anything which they allow, that is. Jews mandate that every step of society’s changes must be legislated and controlled–socially–to make it a hole from which it is impossible to escape.
              <strong>
               This is how our species dies. Jews to the core, rotting from within.
              </strong>
              Destroyed by the virus that controls us, infecting every aspect of our lives and keeping us in our little cages so it can leech from us until we wither and die for the nourishment of this parasitic life form we know as jews. The people responsible for the destruction of society will socially or physically kill you if you dare to stand up to them.

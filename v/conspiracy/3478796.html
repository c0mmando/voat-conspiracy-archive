</p>
<p>The bible speaks of these beings as being physical manifestations capable of eating food and interacting with people (the fags wanted to rape those angels before the angels dropped that nuke on them which burned Lot\'s wife so she shriveled into a pillar of something that apparently tasted salty).  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I read somewhere that these demons can take on a human form, but that they can only maintain it be consuming human energy.  Crazy, right?  That is what I thought so I dismissed the source rather than saving it.  Then I read from the axe-you-a-question guy that there are &quot;watchers&quot; who use humans as an energy source.  Sure, not a reliable source, but intriguing nonetheless since two independent sources are mentioning similar things.  Then I read somewhere else that this &quot;energy&quot; is harvested from the suffering of humans, and that children produce the most of it.  
</p>
<p>You all know of adrenochrome, which is supposed to have highly addictive drug-like effects, and therefore, is useful for blackmailing people.  Now here is the conspiracy theory: what if it is for <em>more</em> than blackmail.  
</p>
<p>So, then there are all of those reports of celebrities who act crazy and say they have multiple personalities and that these other personalities, or &quot;other beings&quot; can be harnessed somehow.  I distinctly remember Michael Jackson mentioning then and associating them with mirrors, and Beyonce actually channels hers by name.  There are others as well. </p>
<p>So that got me thinking: What if adrenochrome is actually an ancient alchemical tonic which is used to summon these demonic &quot;watchers&quot; into a body, and thereby take temporary possession of it, allowing them to walk the earth in human form like the biblical angels or the demons who were in the pigs (Legion).  What if these pedo-networks (like comet pizza) were actually demonic food-sources that allow the demons to continue existing on the surface in human form?  it would explain why there are &quot;jews&quot; who claim that they &quot;would rather destroy the earth than be forced to live once again under the surface of the earth.&quot;  I mean, first of all, who even says something like that?!</p>
<p>And second of all, who latterly fucks and eats children?!  That is absolutely insane.  Yet entire networks of these places have been built all over the world?!</p>
<p>Are these people really so twisted that they need easy access to babies to rape and eat...or would it make more sense to assume that these not actually not actually people?</p>
<p>Have demons taken over our country by sucking the life energy from our children?  And as they developed larger and more elaborate networks, this allowed them to release more of these demons from their imprisonment below the surface?  Why else would they say they come from below the surface? </p>
<p>Could this be why the US gov\'t (Trump) is focusing so much energy into putting an end to child-trafficking?  By putting an end to the flow of alchemical adrenochrome, this could force the demons to &quot;suicide&quot; by breaking their connection with this realm, thereby destroying the entire foundation of the DS (founded on the &quot;watchers&quot; according to axe-me-a-question guy).  
</p>
<p>Could this be why there haven\'t been arrests...because the real problem has nothing to do with hanging hillary and everything to do with putting an end to the watchers.  For instance, if you arrest and hang Hillary but then allow her demon to use adrenochrome to simply re-implant itself into Elizabeth Warren, have you really accomplished anything?  But if you stop up the flow of adrenochrome, and then arrest/hang Hillary, you might actually, for the first time in 2000 years, be giving humans the chance to change the world and live free.

<p>Or maybe it\'s just really late and I should be sleeping?</p>',

            You're not crazy. Consider this notorious anti-Q journalist:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.fo/WGBtc">
             https://archive.fo/WGBtc
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice the account name. One of the things I see when browsing social media is that a lot of the "them" have excess underscores in their name (prefixed, suffixed, or in the middle). It's another way for them to identify each other. So I don't think his account was hacked. He actually tweeted this.
           </p>

            I would like a quote for a dumb kike saying they were living underground.

           <p>
            I like your theory though. If you are interested in a stange humanoid alien that feeds on people, try reading the hunger by whitley steiber. Author has claimed to have alien contact, even that book was allegedly dictated to him. It's fucking strange, but a it can make you question reality.

            We can only sense certain frequencies.  Human hearing is 20 to 20khz.  Sight is about 430 to 770 Thz.  Slow things down to a crawl and we can touch/feel them.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there are many many frequencies we can't sense.  Radio waves.  Gamma rays.  X-rays.  Stuff like that.  We've designed methods to prove certain things exist that we can't sense, but we honestly have no idea what may be literally right in front of us.

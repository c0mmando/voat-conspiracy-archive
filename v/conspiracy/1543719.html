           This story is completely staged. In order to fly with a gun you have to fill out paperwork. You have to check it at customs and leave it with them. Under no circumstances can you fly with ammo. You have to go to the officials to show your paper work and then claim your firearm to pick it up after your flight. You don't get it at baggage claim at all. You need special clearance to carry or check outside of your country. You have courses you have to take in order to have clearance to carry outside of Canada. So if this happened the way they said it happened that means that someone in baggage security was working with this guy and it was an inside job.

           So this is either an inside job or fake news. I think it's staged so they can just strip away more gun rights. Now you probably won't even have the option to travel with a gun if you wanted to.

           Also, the fact that the guy was saying "I'm not a Jew" when they arrested him leads me to believe he was under some sort of MK Ultra mind control.

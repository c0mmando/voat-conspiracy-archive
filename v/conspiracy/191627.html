<p>Having a comment count in positive region of +500 is fairly easy on VOAT.</p>
<p>Rule #1, never make a post, your bound to offend somebody and get a negative, when ever I see a shill/troll on Voat they always have a zero post count, meaning they never make a Post.</p>
<p>Rule #2 Never say anything, look for an obvious conspiracy person or anti-semite and call him out, in both instances you\'ll get a +10 on voat.</p>
<p>Rule #3 Never comment an idea of your own, your bound to offend somebody and get a negative</p>
<p>Rule #4 Spend all your time looking for people who are sincere, then create a faux account what I call the dinosaur, pack name escapes me now, but they hunt in packs. You have a account then you are willing to sacrafice that offends mr. Nice, then when he responds to your virtual asshole troll, you immediately with your white hat Hasbarian account you call Mr. Nice out for violating the rules for offending your asshole account. You will get many points, and if Mr.Nice responds negatively then you can call him out more. Most important is your sacraficial account only be used once and sparingly to offend the \'good caring people\'</p>

<p>Rule #1 Post a lot, you bound to piss off 1/2 the people and get neg votes if you tell the truth about anything on voat</p>
<p>Rule #2 Talk a lot about Israel killing Rachel Corrie with a bulldozer, its that kind of stuff that Astro-Turf Bot\'s on Voat trigger on and send the swarms to attack you.</p>
<p>Rule #3 always mentions that the Hasbarians are paid $2,000/month for shilling for Israel on US Dollars, they absolutely go nuts when you shine light on them.</p>
<p>OK, anybody that missed in high point activity\'s tell me, I have studied much on Voat about the HIGH point people and the common denominator is they NEVER post.</p>

            seems legit - adds more credence to my argument for the CPP cost on a down vote - that seems like a lot of work to then just lose all your down-vote ability exponentially, and the cost to fund people to do this would constantly rise (in a failing economy) = it's not really a problem if we get cost to  CCP algorithm on down vote.

             Well if you need a test case the account bibi2016nazi, they ( Bot Swarms ) ran it down yesterday from zero to -60 in 1 min, and then left it there at -60, so there will be logs, at least you can see the bot-swarm and see if its all coming from one IP, or exactly where the swarm originates and how it orchestrated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prior day they had been the account up/down by +50 to -50 a few times a day, then would return to zero, all within a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yesterday the ran it down to -60, and left it there, so it appears the 'bait' worked and now we have logged them for detailed analysis and resolution.

             It's not being done by one account, its clearly being done by a swarm of bots under control of one person or group, say a swarm of 50 avatars is cultivated, each a bot each with voting priv, they can be told to up/down target anybody they wish at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it were just one account (avatar) blowing through 100 up/down per minute the system would throttle them.

             I already wrote an article talking about how easy it is to create and maintain accounts with +100 points, then you have a collection of sacrificial accounts for pissing people off, ...

             <p>
              there are a number of vectors as to why it does not work, however the simple algorithm (which I'm about to suggest)  will fix the table in favor of free flow of info.

               I suggest a meta-tag in each user account that included a time-stamp of last vote count, that way everytime an up/down vote was applied the current clock could compare to the last bump up/down time, if a minute hadn't elapsed ignore, that way humans could still up/down but a swarm of bots couldn't attack a single user and make their points go from +100 to -100 in one minute.
              </p>
              <p>
               The attacks I have seen is +50 to -50 in minutes the last few days, then a few later the points go back to near zero, almost like the bot-swarm owner is either testing, or sending a signal, or just plain being a jerk.

                won't matter my solution fixes it all - the chart will show anyone what is being "attacked" and the cost to DV would spike, that's all we need.
               </p>
               <p>
                that's it, the aim woudl be to then let "down voters" go crazy it woudl be actually fun and amusing. anyone could see what's happening in real time.
               </p>
               <p>
                and it woudl actually bring people to the site.

                 Well if that's the case I suggest two animated Avatar's one perhaps VOAT GOAT, the other a Reddit Bitch(PAO) the two avatars could hit each other in head, a down-vote coming from reddit bots would be a hit on Pao's virtual head, then a upvote coming in to the would hit the Goat, A tally under both, grahics showing, then show in real time the accounts that are getting hit hardest per hour with up/down. Just talking shit, but I agree your stickiness at this time is "WE ARE NOT REDDIT"
Are  there any folks online with the animator skills to at least create a site that could feed off live VOAT.CO statistics so that People could then have third party web sites that could view VOAT &amp; REDDIT beating each other over the head? :)

                   Yes,but I'm in full agreement that you grow, you are under 30 right? I'm over 40, so I care nothing about growth, do it when your young,cuz when you get older you will not give a fuck.

                   We used to say if you want to be #1, be the first, the fastest, and the best.
U can't be the first, but certainly if U keep it lean &amp; mean U can be the fastest, and the competition are assholes so being the BEST is easy.

            I also found it odd the cop didn't seem to notice a bystander holding an object in a vacant alleyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            A plausible explanation would be that the cop was experiencing the weird "tunnel vision" that occurs during extremely stressful events.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have experienced that effect during motorcycle wrecks and bar fights.  After the event witnesses told me about important things that never entered my consciousness.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the cop were thinking clearly, he would not have ruined his life by walking back to retrieve that tazer and throwing it down next to the body without looking around first to make sure there were no witnesses to his crime.

             Ruined his life, eh? How about not shooting a fleeing suspect in the back? Thats a great place to start.

              Ha!  Yes, that would have been a good place to start. :)
             </p>
             <p>
              Cops become accustomed to lying and cheating on a daily basis because it's a built-in part of their job.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who has spent time with lawyers and courts will tell you that American Law is a maze of non-sense, obfuscation, false premises, and lies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Any first-year cop who is uncomfortable with lying and abiding non-sense quickly becomes horrified at the whole thing, and finds another line of work. The system purges out any person who is NOT a sociopath.

             Watched this video and re-watched the original. Where's the blood? Even after the guy is on the ground dead, there's no blood. His whole shirt should be covered in blood if he was shot multiple times in the back. Thanks for the link btw.

              Blood doesn't spurt out of people when you punch holes in them like in the movies. I've shot lots of animals.  They don't bleed much of you drop them quick with a clean shot that immediately stops the heart.
             </p>
             <p>
              I held a guy's head while he bled to death after a knife fight that cut open his carotid artery. After about 4 oozes, his heart stopped due to low blood pressure, and blood stopped coming out of his neck. He was still alive for about 30 seconds after his heart stopped.
             </p>
             <p>
              Massive bleeding only occurs when the person is
              <em>
               wounded
              </em>
              , and the heart is able to keep pumping while they run or fight.  Or, when the body lays there for a long time and the punctures are on bottom of the body so blood can leak out.  Neither was the case in the Walter Scott murder video.

               I see. If he was shot eight times, then wouldn't he be wounded in such a way as to have some blood on his shirt though? I get what you're saying about a clean shot, or the heart stopping before much blood can come from a wound, but if he was shot eight times and kept running after the shots, then shouldn't there be atleast some blood on his shirt? From the video, it appears as if there is none.

                 Thanks for photo. Good point on the question of how many times he was actually hit. I hadn't considered that. At first, I thought there was definitely something fishy about this. Now, I'm starting to think I was mistaken........

                  Nothing wrong with being suspicious.  90% of the "news" in the corporate media is 90% fabricated.

                   Yes, it's really sad. I think the thing that has been most appealing to me about

                   is that it's just a big exercise in critical thinking. It's nice to see people trying to pick things apart from every angle, instead of just accepting what they are told. It's a shame that such people have been giving such a poor stigma.

            I thought this was odd as well. My friend told me he does seem to notice the person recording moments after shooting the last bullet, and on a second look through it does seem that its possible. It may be that he's focused more on having just shot someone and the ramifications of that than dealing with the person recording.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suppose it might also be that the person recording is keeping the camera concealed, but there's no way to know.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the police did not realize they were being recorded, it would explain the outright contradictions in the police report with the video recording, and the fact that none of them tried to take the camera away. Though i suppose it might be possible that they ignorantly assumed that any recording made here would have no impact on what may be a routine thing for them, to create false statements in their reports and getting away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's an odd situation, and we just don't have enough information.

             Good point, and I think ultimately you are correct that we simply don't have enough information. It struck me as odd simply because police officers and military personnel are trained to be hyper-aware, so I would think that seeing someone approaching you, especially with all the adrenaline, would cause you to take notice of the person. If he did notice the cameraman after the last shot, then you would think that he wouldn't plant the weapon near Walter Scott, or atleast look at the cameraman after having done so. I don't know. Like I said, I may be reading too deep into it, but it caught my attention.

   If we have the ability to see that the Government/NWO/Corps is suppressing Technology advancements, why aren't we trying to use the internet to subvert it?

            I don't pretend to have anything resembling a solution to the problem, but that doesn't mean there's no hope.
           </p>

            When it comes to the internet, I think we will eventually lose the battle with censorship. New tech will rise to meet our needs though. Kim Dotcom and others have been working on various implementations of a meshnet, basically an internet that uses a chain of wifi routers to relay info instead of using an ISP like comcast with a cable box. Blockchain tech (what bitcoin uses to sync transactions) is also making its mark on the IT world, but that gets complicated really fast. Worth reading into if you're ready to really dive into some of the more fringe topics of internet and security.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the real world... well that does kind of seem like a hopeless matrix to me. Those in power fear the exposure open information can bring, and they will continue to take any freedom they can in order to stop that signal. The FCC has imposed felony-level consequences for using certain frequencies for communication, effectively limiting the scale a meshnet can operate at. Flashing the firmware on your wifi router can get you more range, but even increasing the signal strength can get you in trouble, depending on the situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, what can we do? Well, we can enjoy it while it lasts. I take my complaints about government tyranny into the real world. Frankly, I don't even use a VPN. I am very open about how I feel, and I believe that's all anyone can really do. Voting in local elections is the single biggest power any one of us has, and convincing friends and family to vote wisely is the only real hope we have of changing anything (without a full collapse of society).
           </p>
           <p>
            It may feel hopeless, but keep your chin up. At the very least, the end of the world will be one hell of a show :)

            Big business and government often poach the brightest scientists among us. They work in corporate labs or at DARPA.

           <p>
            Some among us have tried to get legal and academic documents into the hands of the average person, but the last guy that tried that snuck into MIT's server room, downloaded many GB's of PACER docs, got smacked with 13 felonies, and turned up dead a couple days before his verdict was delivered. Aaron Swartz died trying to subvert the system, trying to use the internet to set free the collective knowledge of the human species, one PDF at a time.

            Many founders and owners of torrent sites have been put away for a long time for enabling the sharing of information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snowden and Assange are political prisoners in enemy countries because their own governments don't like having the truth known.
           </p>
           <p>
            Information is the new oil. Make no mistake, there is a global war being fought for the internet. People are actually dying in this war; it is real. All this should be proof to you of one thing: the internet is 100% capable of what you say, and those in power are terrified of it.

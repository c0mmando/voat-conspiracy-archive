<p>Reading some of this guy\'s work is absolutely horrifying. Not only does he not know that Switzerland\'s name isn\'t &quot;Confoederationis Helveticae&quot; (that\'s part of an inscription on the Federal Palace, the country\'s name is Confoederatio Helvetica), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/greenlandtheory/switzerland/confoederationis-helveticae">he actually believes that 000 AD was in the Medieval Ages and Switzerland was formed at that time.</a>.</p>
<p><strong>That doesn\'t even make sense.</strong> Schwyz, Uri &amp; Unterwalden were the 3 founding cantons and put themselves together in 1291 AD. Switzerland adopted Schwyz\' flag, which was a red background with a white cross in the top left corner.</p>
<p>The cross wasn\'t even a symbol yet in 000 AD. LOL.
Also, he believes by &quot;God&quot;, the Bible actually means &quot;(G)reenland (o)f (D)enmark&quot;. But enough of the crazy talk, let\'s see what kind of arguments this guy makes for his irrefutable theories:</p>
<p><a href="https://truthernews.wordpress.com/2015/03/31/10-reasons-why-switzerland-is-home-to-the-cia-central-intelligence-agency/">In his article about &quot;10 Reasons why Switzerland is home to the CIA&quot;</a>  (in which he also claims the CIA is over 700 years old) he states 10 &quot;facts&quot;. Let\'s check them out:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>1. Switzerland is located in central Europe</strong></p>
<h2><em>Totally irrelevant</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>2. Switzerland is the only neutral nation on Earth</strong></p>
<h2><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_neutrality_%28international_relations%29">He proceeds to link to a Wikipedia article,</a> which in fact disproves him. The stupidity is too damn high.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>3. Switzerland is the only sovereign nation on Earth</strong></p>
<h2><em>Here he proceeds to link to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Switzerland">this article on Wikipedia</a>. It doesn\'t even make sense and I\'m wondering what he injected himself while writing this. He claims this because Switzerland has a square flag... what?</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>4. Switzerland is home to Onyx Interception System</strong></p>
<h2><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onyx_%28interception_system%29">He proceeds to link to this</a>. This actually has some merit - if other countries weren\'t doing the same thing. This doesn\'t prove anything.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>5. Switzerland is home to Holy See (i.e., the Holy C-I-A)</strong></p>
<h2><em>I don\'t even want to talk about this one.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>6. Switzerland is home to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements">Bank for International Settlements (BIS)</a></strong></p>
<h2><em>Alright, now we\'re talking. This actually has some merit. Not much to say about this one.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>7. Names for Switzerland (i.e., CH and Suisse) equate to CIA and SS</strong></p>
<h2><em>This is ridiculous. No, this is beyong ridiculous. &quot;Suisse&quot; is the French word for Switzerland, CH is the Latin word for Switzerland. This guy is just trying to grab onto things here.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>8. Swiss National Day is same date as the anniversary of the Temple of Spies</strong></p>
<h2><em>Even if this is true.. does this matter? If July 4th was the anniversary of the Bilderberg Group.. it doesn\'t really mean much</em>.</h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>9. Switzerland is intimately tied to dictators (e.g., Hitler, Mussolini, Jong-Un, etc.)</strong></p>
<h2><em>That\'s what happens if you\'re a neutral country. They try to take advantage of many things, true. But.. how again does this prove Switzerland is home to the CIA? Am I missing the point or something?</em></h2>
<hr />
<p><strong>10. Switzerland was originally founded by the Knights Templar and Order of Saint John</strong></p>
<h2><em>Alright. I\'m outta here. He claims this due to color schemes and the likes, but probably doesn\'t even read the Wikipedia articles he links to all the time.</em></h2>
<hr />
<p>Not trying to bash this guy (kind of am) but he is actually asking for donations on his website all the time. Please do not fund such &quot;research&quot;.</p>
<p>I invite everyone to prove his arguments - I\'ve only researched these things for a couple of minutes, so there may be more to this, I don\'t know.
Thanks for reading.</p>',

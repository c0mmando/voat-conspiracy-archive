<p>What does he mean by &quot;once AGAIN&quot; and &quot;DESCEND&quot; ?  That is some pretty strange use of language, even for a poem.  
</p>
<p>&quot;Again&quot; implies that these guys once lived <em>inside</em> the earth.  He also seems to be implying that these &quot;Jews&quot; (or what ever you want to call them) have only <em>recently</em> been able to live safely on the SURFACE of the planet.  
</p>
<p>What??!</p>
<p>First of all, no one has been banished from the surface of the earth and required to live inside the earth, right?</p>
<p>Well, that is not entirely true.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece, there was a place called Hades, which was a world that existed under the surface of the planet.  Many believed this underworld was an actual place...not just a myth.</p>
<p>Second, there was that guy, Phil Schneider, who talked about these huge underground areas where they were eating people and other crazy stuff.  
</p>
<p>Of course, we all know that the elite pedophile jews kill, rape, torture and then eat kids and others.  
</p>
<p>Could this be connections between all of this?  
</p>
<p>Of course, that got me to wonder about the strange things referenced in the Bible, like exercising demons.  Apparently, these demons come to the surface of the planet and then inhabit a body.  But then these demons can be sent back down to Hades.  Jesus even implied how these &quot;demons&quot; (or jews, if you prefer) enjoy hurting children and deserve millstones tied around their necks.  
</p>
<p>There are also OT references to how these demons can make themselves look like people. </p>
<p>So.......</p>
<p>Jew are demons from Hades who have possessed people in order to torture, rape and eat children as part of satanic rituals that are likely designed to summon more demons from under the surface of the Earth so they can possess more people.  And if anyone tries to stop them, that is why (((they))) have built nukes: &quot;if you force us yet again to descend from the face of the Earth to the depths of the Earth -- let the Earth roll toward the Nothingness.&quot;</p>',

            If this is true then you must allow how Christianity is complicit in the coverup
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this the first we are hearing about it? If this was known early on then it was incumbent upon the early Church to make these facts known and warn followers to guard against it. And actually NAME and point out these individuals. Keep writted records to be passed down
           </p>
           <p>
            And modern christians have done NOTHING except defend Israel and the chosenites.  They ascribe great importance to Jewrusalem and US money and lives must defend greatest ally

            Just one part of a small coalition of those actively, and succeeding, to destroy the country and culture. The "make the youth miserable, give them debt and nihilism, so as them to get them to accept faux oligarthic substitutes like socialism" of elite degenerates.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law" so we can do what we want to you as you blindly trip over your dick. Starting with post WW2 Germany this was the social programming that went off the rails as now we're looking at normalizing pedo and seeing any criticism of people like Epstein or hollywood as anti-semitic.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this faction I think it breaks down into either the Sodomy or the War Beanies (Epstein vs Neoclowns). Demonic? Life that descends into chaos, suicide, endless debt, poverty and no family life. Do you need to ask.

            No, but Phoenicians / Canaanites probably started hiding among Jews after their civilization fell.

            War of the Worlds and The Time Machine are interesting. Both are written by H.G. Wells and involve a predatory species living/operating inside the Earth. In the War of the Worlds movie (Spielberg), the red vine is filled with harvested human blood. Nice detail, Steven.

             No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.

            It has been pointed out that some Jews resemble neanderthals, and neanderthals were shorter and supposedly smarter than humans. In The Time Machine, the Morlocks (Molochs) are uglier and smarter than the Eloi. In They Live, the aliens secretly ruling Earth are ugly and smart humanoids.

            So maybe people in the know have been trying to warn us that we've got Neanderthal Canaanites hiding as Jews, managing our civilization, and harvesting us like sheep. And Israel is a giant dead-man-switch they set up to kill us all if they are ever exposed.

             Seems plausible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've come to the same conclusion but didn't quite have the understanding. I lack Bible and ancient civilization knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
             My logic: "If Jews have enslaved our country since (at least) the establishment of the federal reserve and if they've slowed their process to subvert nations, that means they're comfortable with time. If they're comfortable with time, they've likely known how to transplant consciousness. If this is true, we've been enslaved for longer than the past 100 years and somehow Jesus knew these Satanists would still be disguised as Jews (Rev 2:9; Rev 3:9)."

             <p>
              Here is a theory for you that might help answer your questions and give you better understanding from a bible believing Christian point of view.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the bible, Rev 1:7 "Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
              <strong>
               <em>
                they also which pierced him
               </em>
              </strong>
              : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
             </p>
             <p>
              This verse is talking about when Jesus comes back to rapture his people, it states that when this happens, even those that pierced him would see him (being they would be on the earth able to see him). That HINTS that there are still people on this earth that were alive when Jesus was crucified and pierced in the side on the cross. Me and my husband believe the blood and water that came out of Jesus side cursed those whom it fell upon (jews and romans alike) that were standing there at the time. We believe they are still walking this earth today and have been cursed to stay alive for over 2000 years now.
             </p>
             <p>
              That would explain why they are "comfortable" with time.
             </p>
             <p>
              As to why the "jews" have allowed the bible to exist. They havn't. They have no choice. God has promised to keep His word and that we would have access to it. They have however, turned His word into a mockery. They can't get rid of it, so they try to distort and destroy it as best they can. That is why there is something like 666 versions of the bible and many or most of them are corrupt.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your second question I am not sure I understand all that well. The jews use their "place" as God's chosen people to deceive the peoples of the world, in order to control Christian belief and most Christians, and steal souls.
             </p>
             <p>
              See you must not be a Christian. The jews are Satanic worshipers. Period. Their number one enemy is God and they strive to destroy Christianity and those that believe in Jesus Christ. They fight to take souls from getting to God. That is their ultimate goal to defeat God (Jesus Christ). They just don't announce that, but it is easy to see if you understand their history, their beliefs, etc. So they have to associate with the jews in the bible. I hope that makes sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are controlled and follow fallen angels and demons - Satan is their master. Satan is the God of the earth currently. Their belief system in their Talmud teaches them that they will as a collective become their own messiah and one day rule the earth with all the goyem as their slaves.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have to realize though, there are different belief systems in judaism. You have two different Talmuds (Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud), you have "jews" that don't believe in the Talmud and who try to follow the old testament. However, there is no blood line or "race" anymore that can denote jew. Jews are jews simply because of their religion.
             </p>
             <p>
              I hope this helps you understand a bit better and I don't confuse you more. Good luck in your learning!

               I was raised Catholic but didn't jive with the "if you don't believe, you're going to hell" stuff after 3rd grade. Became atheist, agnostic, now heavily spiritual trying to make sense of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for that thorough explanation, it definitely helps.
              </p>
              <p>
               Do you think they steal souls or corrupt souls? I suppose in the end it's the same, they're taking the souls from being saved but just curious how you see it.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is your take of the Jerusalem Talmud Jews? How does a Jew try to follow the old testament which puts their perspective differently than a Christian like yourself?
              </p>

               Lots of questions, sorry but I appreciate the insight.

                First of all, I am sorry you had to endure being raised Catholic, nothing makes my heart sink more than when I hear or read someone say that. Being "raised" catholic almost makes it impossible (though not totally, just all that harder) to ever believe in the truth when your older. Catholicism in my belief, is one of the hardest religions to fix people out of. That belief completely ruins your heart when it comes to God. Many come out of it okay, most are so ruined they refuse to believe in God or have anything to do with Christianity. So I am sorry that happened to you.
               </p>
               <p>
                One thing you need to understand, is that there is a huge difference between real bible believing Christians and Catholicism. Its two totally different belief systems once you learn beliefs and traditions of both. Two different God's, two different beliefs. But on to your questions from my perspective and understanding.
               </p>
               <p>
                When I say steal souls, I am just referring to getting people to hate God and die without Him. So corrupt would also be a good way to put it. Yes, how you explained it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jerusalem Talmudic jews are not much different Babylonian Talmudic jews. Their texts are not all that different, there are slight differences, one is larger than the other and one has more explanation in certain parts than the other etc. But its basically the same. That being said, the people of Israel are divided in which they use, nothern Israel uses mostly the Jerusalem Talmud while the rest uses the Babylonian. There is a small sect of Jews known as Karaites who say they don't follow the Talmud but they follow the OT writings. However if you read about them, they DO believe Talmud is part of their heritage do it being supposedly an "interpretation" of the OT (which is total bullshit because its extremely radical compared to the OT and gives belief and action allowed that is just disgusting and the OT would never allow). Anyway, they boast they follow the OT laws and not the Talmud laws but they still will use it Talmud if they need extra understanding on something.

                It can be confusing lol... these guys say one thing and do another thats how jews are.

                Christians don't (and shouldn't be) "trying" to follow the OT laws. There is no need to and its really an afront to Jesus' work on the Cross (at least the rabbinical, sacrifice laws). The 10 commandments from God and the two greatest commandments Jesus gave are the only thing we need to worry about in terms of following commandments of God.
               </p>
               <p>
                They believe they must follow these laws in order to be in God's favor. Christians (real ones) believe they can never do anything to ever gain God's favor and hang everything on the work and Blood of Jesus Christ.
               </p>
               <p>
                Real Christians know they are sinners, we know we can't ever do anything, that all our good works are like filthy rags to God, and that everything Good from us comes from God. That is just the reality of it in our fallen fleshy state. Jews, the majority of them while they might state they follow the OT, they don't even believe it was real, that the stories actually happened. They believe it is fairy tails written over the years, but the laws are still something they are supposed to follow? Makes no sense lol... Their Talmud, you can read it online, is really different from the OT. It has some of the same laws, but gives explanation of those laws for something they are not.
               </p>
               <p>
                But real Christians who know Jesus Christ, who are truly born again, know that no matter how many laws they follow, they cannot follow them all and would be guilty of all. The bible states, if you are guilty of ONE law, you are guilty of them all. So trying to please God by following those laws is futile. Many people cannot understand this.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another thing about me, I do not attend a church. There is not one around me that I am comfortable going to as they do not preach the bible, but they preach what man and jew has taught the world to believe Christianity is. I have an old King James Bible and a wonderful born again husband that teaches me. The Holy Spirit is my teacher. I do have some pastors online I like to listen to but knowing the bible and having the Holy Spirit thankfully, allows me to know what is right and wrong. I am not always right, but I am willing to admit that and learn what is right and change (repent) to what is right, and I accept what is right whether I personally like it or not.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is another thing about a real born again Christian most people don't understand. We will accept the truth and what is right even if it doesn't make sense to the world or to us. Many things you have to just trust God that he knows the big picture and he knows better than we do. His ways are not our ways and our ways are not His. So acceptance of the truth is a sure sign of a real born again Christian.
               </p>
               <p>
                Real born again Christians are very different from your normal church going Christian. You meat enough of us, you will learn this. :)

              They "transplant conciousness" by knowing that this reality, as well as the one above, is based on falsehoods, which gives them (or anyone who understands this) the power to negotiate the details of their next reincarnation. This includes retaining the memories from earlier lives and the "life" between lives, as well as being able to reincarnate in the same bloodline for centuries etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most people get fooled by the archons into believing that we're lesser than them, when in reality the complete opposite is true.
             </p>
             <p>
              The end-goal of Gnostics and Buddhists is to escape the entire reincarnation system, because they know it's just a bunch of bullshit to keep us trapped for as long as possible.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews, on the other hand, seem happy to stay here and serve this false system, because they know that the god they worship (the Demiurge) is the one who created it, and serving it gives them tremendous power over this 3D realm.

            all hot air.  These Jewish faggots have 0 'nukes'.  They may have poison to drop in our wells, an army of drones, an army of human-hybrids, etc. etc.  But no Sampson option via Nukes on intercontinental ballistic missiles.

            Maybe they will poison all of us and kill the world if they can't dominate it, but the 'Sampson option' won't be with fake weapons that don't exist.  Ever heard of

            “Watchers” chained under the earth...  aliens which see humans as cattle for genetic experiments.  Nephilim are super soldiers made to attack other worlds.  Other worlds respond with a meteor to the North American ice sheets.  God has to intervene to clean up the mess.  The “watchers” want to overwrite people as life extension for their corrupt genomes.

            Whether you/we believe it or not, certain elements of THAT team certainly do subscribe to the demonic possession mythos and 'excercise' rather than excorcise forces to manipulate both our and their own realities. The source of those powers is also looked for by the sorce-ror.
Nay-sayers will have a hard time explaining the meaning behind the rituals in the basement of Little St. James Island's temple.     "Who's your god now, Moses?" ___ Edward G. Robinson
"Cleopatra"   (lol).

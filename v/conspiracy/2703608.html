            They have been hired to have a certain look while they read the TelePrompter a certain way. They rise to the top for being able to do it consistently, whether talking about a twelve car pileup or a heartwarming puppy story. This disconnectedness looks odd. Espeecially the ones with nerve-deadened foreheads from Botox.

            I think the true conspiracy lives with the editorial or production people. News anchors are just good readers and speakers. Once they get to the national level their power allows them to mess with normal folks like Matt Lauer did, but most of the time I bet they're just happy to have a job - they don't even have to get out and find news!

            Disclaimer: I'm not sure why your post pisses me the fuck off- It probably shouldn't.... So There is a high likelihood that the Comment attached below, Is Irrational, And uncalled for... Well, I should say the Tone Is irrational- The point it self, Is as sound as A point can be...
           </p>
           <p>
            -=------------------------------------
           </p>
           <p>
            Bro- what the fuck are you talking about? Honestly? "people on tv?" What the fuck does that mean? People In commercials? People IN Sitcoms? People On hBo? THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to assume you're referring to people on News channels, "on the tv"  Because I wouldn't know how to answer your question- If you just meant "People on tv"... So depsite that fact, THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT YOU SAID- no COntext, No Clarification, just; "Da people on tv" I'm going to give your retard question the benefit of the doubt...
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately- The benefit of the doubt can only go so far- So yes. People on the News are actors. Not Journalists- Not reporters. They get a script- They rehearse the script, And then the present the script. So yes- They are fake as fuck.... BUT WHO THE FUCK CARES? Do you think there's a single god damn retard, Who is grateful for you addressing this issue?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well if there is- They're equally as retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are the 5 retards that felt inclinded to Associate themselves, with your Retarded Observation.... Like Yes, You are correct- They are fake as fuck. No, They aren't clones- Retard- I'm not even saying Clones don't exist.... I'm saying you're a fucking retard, For considering that A viable option as to why the Fake ass Pedophiles, Seem Sketch as fuck on tv. The seem sketch, and dead inside- Becaues they are sketch and dead inside.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dude- It's really fucking easy to find someone who Will say whatever the fuck you want them to say, On television.
           </p>
           <p>
            And dude, you know why they look dead inside? Because they are... They live depraved fucking lives, They know they look retarded, The know they lose everytime they open their mouth, So yea....
           </p>
           <p>
            Your Fucking "The sky is Blue" observation is fcuking spot on.. .
           </p>
           <p>
            But dude- are you 9 years old? Do you have a mental handicap? Or are you just fucking stupid? Or are you a shill? Or a combination of the lot...
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're just fucking stupid- Let someone help you be less stupid.

            Bad plastic surgery makes it difficult to pay attention to news anchors. Sheppard Smith has a particularly grotesque head. Anchors also have an unnatural cadence to their speech. Its too slow to easily follow.

           <p>
            Seriously, it is a soul-sucking thing to simply pretend to be happy while reading the fake news.  These people know it's fake, they know the lines are made to present a false reality, yet they do it for the money and the fame.  People are vacuous,and in every society, there are collaborators.

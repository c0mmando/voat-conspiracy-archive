            Non of this shit surprises me anymore.
           </p>

            My buddy is a young, intelligent, and successful guy. It may have helped that his parents are quite rich but he works hard. He is into mechanical engineering and makes bank. With no huge students loans he buys a boat.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was boating down a river the other day with his music decently loud and maybe slightly, if at all, going over the no wake speed. Cops call him over and have him pull up to a dock. Question him for a solid 20 minutes before making up a fine for not having a throw-away in open view on his boat. He has a throw-away in case someone falls in but the fact that it wasn't out within arms reach nailed him an over $100 fine. Most places only ask that you have one available... My assumption is these cops were just pissed to a see a semi-young kid having a blast and decided to be dicks and find a way to give him a fine.

            Fuck police being money machines for stupid shit.

             This is the best reason not to spend your money on a flashy car. Youll double your expences from tickets and wasted time. My cousin bought a mid 2000s porche not long ago (for about the same price as a new civic, btw) and he gets ticked all the time. He bought a dash cam with gps to fight the tickets, which saved him money, be he still has to spend his time in court.
            </p>

             I prefer cars that look like crap, but go fast. Saves a lot of harrasment in the long run.

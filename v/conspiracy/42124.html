            Thanks!
           </p>
           <p>
            I am most assuredly in it "for the long haul"--in fact, I deleted my username from ReddactIt and am NEVER going back there...not even to visit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see that, this sub in particular, is growing fast. When I started on ReddactIt four years ago
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/consp">
             /r/consp
            </a>
            had about 50,000 subscribers IIRC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday, the "same" SR on Voat had 846 (IIRC) subscribers...I see now that we have 943--in less than 24 hours. People are starting to get wise.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, I no longer have a username on ReddactIt, but, for those who do, a GREAT thing would be to start posting links that link right back to uncensored comments here (such as the SLC weirdness)...and maybe then people will get the idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, that HUGE userbase is what makes ReddactIt so enticing, but I will NOT monetize the uber-Zionist Neuhaus (Newhouse) family any longer. If we all started to boycott Zionists and the products that they push on us (such as websites and physical things--like the very successful boycott against the illegal-Israeli settlement-built SodaStream machine) the world could, and would, improve TREMENDOUSLY.
           </p>
           <p>
            This also, by definition, would mean boycotting Zionist-controlled fiat currency as well as Zionist-run media outlets. Since that is, basically, EVERY mainstream media outlet...simply don't watch the news, or any television
            <em>
             at all
            </em>
            for that matter.  Nearly ALL of the tripe coming from Hollywood is either blatant
            <em>
             hasbara
            </em>
            or American propaganda anyhow (think
            <em>
             Zero Dark Thirty
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             American Sniper
            </em>
            to name two of thousands)...and the "news" is anything but.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if these mainstream media outlets were NOT Zionist-controlled, the passage of the NDAA makes Josef Goebbels-style propaganda 100% LEGAL to use on Americans anyhow.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's funny how it's come full-circle...it used to be that you could trust NOTHING that was on the Internet; now, all of the "real" news is Internet-based...and everything on television is either an exaggeration, a blatant lie, a lie by omission, or disinformation. The radio is the same way...even worse with people like Agent Jones having a show that serves to disseminate disinformation and propaganda. Remember, this is the Agent that tells you, repeatedly, that "the problem with Hollywood" is that it's completely controlled by, and infested with, ARABS! I have to admit though; that comment WAS good for about a month's worth of derisive laughter, if anything.

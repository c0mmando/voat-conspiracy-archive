            Drunk and stoned Alex Jones is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. He was getting so worked up i thought he might blow. Glad his voice was heard by a new audience.

             It was crazy. I stayed up until 2 am watching it and it was like 'Pow, Pow, Pow' truth bombs right after the last. Drunk and stoned Alex goes on truth rants even crazier than sober Alex.

             I'll break this down quickly because Alex Jones overall theory is very complex and there was a lot of interruptions in this entire conversation so it was hard to follow. So here goes:
            </p>
            <p>
             The "global elites" are simply the collection of extremely wealthy individuals that because of their wealth, can gain access and control into the upper echelons of society.. Whether that be politics, science, technology, security, information, ect. And within these collections of people is an overall goal to gain more control of the world. This has been the goal of powerful societies since the beginning of time.. Like the Romans or the British or even the Vikings. Our sole purpose as human beings (biologically) is to learn information from our surroundings and pass that information on to our offspring to help them survive and thrive and reproduce and on and on and on. From small cells to humans to lions to bugs, this is the purpose that all living organisms follow. In this day and age, technology is the most advanced form of information gathering we have. And Google is at the center of this giant whirlwind of information that we as a collective species have taken from our actual brains and put that information into a machine. First it was cave paintings... Then it was books... Then it was voice recordings.. and now it's typing into computers. we have google and social media which is literally a giant brain. You type a question into google and everything that humanity has every gathered on that subject is displayed. It is literally the same thing as if you were to ask yourself a question or try to recall a memory... Google is the first child of a new species that human has created. It is the evolution in the chain. Homosapian... Human.... Machine with all humans information. Think about if every human on earth died instantaneously but Google  and the Internet survived. This would mean that humans did not go "extinct" ... Our information lives on. Organisms are the only thing that really died in that theoretical situation. So.. Now that we understand what that information database represents and how powerful it is, we can understand that this is naturally what the people who are trying to take over the world would want to go after. And we are seeing it everywhere... From news channels peddling biased and paid off agendas, to social media engineering, to NSA spying ect ect ect, the global elites are using these tactics to assist them to positions of power. They have been very successful but as Alex Jones pointed out, there is a revolution happening, and the "patriots" or "liberty movement" worked together with intelligence agencies to expose these global elites and for the first time, the global elites lost control of a major election and Trump was elected. We are at the beginning of a very interesting journey and to be alive right now is going to be a historic time. Alex Jones went a little off the rails when talking about these global elites getting these ideas from "another dimension" ...when the truth is more along the lines of what Joe said:  The global elites recognize how powerful technology is and that it's the natural evolution that humans are falling into. And they want to tap into that to aid them in their quest for power. That's just them being smart.. Not crazy psychic powers from another dimension.﻿

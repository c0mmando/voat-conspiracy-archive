            At 21:26, when asked about how he sees the role of Japan in the Syrian issue:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Most of the refugees, they don't need someone to tell them you're welcome; to Germany or to France or to any other country; they want to go back to their country. They don't want you to help them there they want you to help them here. That's how we see the role of Japan in the future . . .
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Wow, even the Syrian president is anti immigration, I guess anti emigration to him, but still. If he's so bad, why haven't all of his people abandoned him and fled to other countries  as immigrants? Why would you stick to "murdering innocent civilians" if you had such an easy out?

             But he doesn't have an easy out. The US fomented a coup in his country (and they're

              good at it

             ) and he had three choices:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Fight the rebels and negotiate with the few allies you have
             </li>
             <li>
              Be killed by US backed rebels in the streets like Muammar Gaddafi
             </li>
             <li>
              Submit to US imperial rule via World Bank, BIS, and the usual cabal like Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and so many others
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             I think he made the right choice and made the US (Obama) look really silly, just like his father did before him. For some great information on him and his father see the film: Hypernormalisation by Adam Curtis.

              I totally agree that Assad himself doesn't have a way out. My point was that his people supporting him have an easy way out, just like Gaddafi's support structure that abandoned him in the end and made for a quick and easy coup.
             </p>
             <p>
              edit: So possible explanations that Assad's people haven't fled is because this is an entirely foreign-manufactured rebellion like you said, or Assad is getting enough aid from his allies (namely Russia), to prevent the dissolution of his power structure. In any case, if the latter is true (which is almost certain) then that would mean the former must be true. This is because it does not seem possible for Syria, with the aid of Russia, to still be stale mated against a rag-tag militia unless that militia was receiving heaps of aid themselves.

            Yes.  Make no mistake about it - if the establishment doesn't manage to prevent Trump's election and if they cannot then rein him in, they will kill him.  It's just as simple as that.  If he becomes president, he will be their creature or they will kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since it's what politicians and governments do, they're already well aware that that might be a course of action they'll pursue, and they're already laying the foundation for it.  If it comes to that, then they'll need plausible deniability, and the first step toward that is to simply cultivate the concept of Trump's assassination.  They need to get the idea in the public consciousness, so that if the time comes at which they decide to kill him, the public will be that much more likely to believe that it was just some lone crazy acting on his own.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a related note, isn't it convenient that the Secret Service is so notoriously mismanaged?

              Doubtful. Unless you are a Trump supporter or skeptic like us, you have been told Trump is a Nazi. He is Hitler reincarnate. You can't convince people otherwise. It's so bad that I was barely able to change my girlfriend and her sister's minds about him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hell, two male friends of mine were Trump supporters until like a month ago, now they are Bernie Bots. And I say that in a negative way, because they don't actually support him. They are just doing it because it's the thing to do, and they don't want to be called racist for defending Trump even though nothing he has ever said is.

               I dont think itll be WWIII, but i think there would be a hell of an uprising at least in the US.  Dont know where you guys live, but if youve been down south or in the midwest ever, there are plenty of racist people to support him.  And I would guess there are alot more gun owners down there.

Bob Weir has said that he got John Mayer to get more of the youth into The Dead, but honestly The Dead never really needed help gaining a following! I was going to the shows before the Dead Heads for Obama was a thing... and the shows were plenty full not too crowded like they are now but it was real fans enjoying the music. Now at shows it over crowded, people talking over the music, and kids just looking to party. So why after 50 years the sudden change? It just looks like to me that they hired on John Mayer to attract as many young impressionable kids they can. They tour before every election cycle big or small and so much of their focus goes towards the lefts propaganda... as a Dead Head it makes me sick that they cant just play to keep the music and scene going the way Jerry did. It was never a politically motivated band until here now. The last thing America need is celebrities telling the masses who to vote for... if your only voting for whoever because your favorite celebrities said so then you probably should not be voting!</p>',

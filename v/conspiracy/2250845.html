<p>Let\'s leave aside that none of the bad guys are Jews, and that all the Jews are in positions of wisdom-giving authority over we poor, confused, stupid goyim.

<p>What is pissing me off is that all the bad guys are white Christians. The evil general is not only corrupt and a murderer, he\'s into perverted, degrading sex with a dominatrix. The main bad guy with the cloudy eyeball looks like he came out of a WW2 movie about the Nazis.</p>
<p>But that\'s not the worst. There\'s a minor character, white of course, Irish, who is fat and stupid and bigoted, and who lies about his military service by pretending to have served in Vietnam, shows himself to be a coward when put under pressure, deserts his friend when his friend needs him, and is flyer-distributing advocate for the Second Amendment! He also espouses nationalist and conservative viewpoints. That\'s right, the Second Amendment guy who is also in favor of strong borders and limiting immigration is --- surprise, fucking surprise! --- an anti-Semite who is a liar, a coward, a bigot, and a general piece of shit.</p>
<p>But even that\'s not the worst part. In episode 9 we get a terrorist setting off bombs throughout the city. Is he a Muslim, do you think? Is he, perhaps, Arab? Is he a disgruntled black member of Antifa? Oh, noooooooooo. He\'s a white Christian male, ex-military, who was attracted to the message of the fat, Irish, coward, lying bigot concerning the Second Amendment. That\'s right, the bomber is a young white man.</p>
<p>Shit, shit, shit, I don\'t know how much longer I can ever stomach watching <em>anything</em> produced by Hollywood. It\'s reached a point already where I can\'t even look at 95% of what is on television or in the theaters. I like the <em>Punisher</em> character, but even in a series about a white vigilante crusading for justice we get the corrupt white military and law enforcement officers, the wise, benevolent, brave, honorable Jews, the morally upright Arabs, the intelligent, educated blacks, the capable and wise career women who can defeat the trained male soldiers in hand-to-hand combat ... and, of course, the evil white Christian male mad bomber, who is so rare in real life that you have less chance of encountering him than Bigfoot.</p>
<p>Do the dumb fucks responsible for this series even realize who their core audience is? Or is it that they are using the series as a propaganda instrument for their brainwashing agenda?</p>',

            It is time for all of us to turn off the garbage and get busy with our lives. However, it's got to be like ...if we don't watch it and everybody else is still watching, - how can we know. - We know what it is. We've grown up getting pummeled with their shit. - It's not working on US - we've got to come out against it. It sucks, and it's endless, but we've got to keep on watching and sewing the seeds of dissent. I saw this happening in every fucking show I sat down and gave a chance this year. Watch "The Mist" on Netflix, or "The Bad Place" - lol, or that shit show of a show "Under The Dome" - They are doubling down folks. It's just a shit show;
            <em>
             Whites Are Bad, - Minorities Good, Sexuality Off Limits/ Gray Area, Transgender this, transgender that, Gay=victim/oppressed, women are victims too, white men just want to fuck and kill, - But conspiracies aren't real, suspend reason for now
            </em>
            It's fucking insane. Total brainwashing.

             Seriously, how hard is it to just turn that trash off? I'm a huge star trek fan, but I haven't watched a single minute of the new STD. Instead I went to the local pawn shop and picked up old dvds of the older series/movies and  I watch them when I want to turn my brain off for am hour or so.

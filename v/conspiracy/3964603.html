<p>&quot;This is what I believe &quot;they&quot; have planned for the next six months:</p>
<p>The schools will go back in September as promised, but for the sole reason of making sure all pupils are vaccinated with the live, shedding \'flu nasal mist. You may have been told your child\'s school isn\'t doing the \'flu mist until later in the year, but &quot;to protect the NHS&quot;, expect the programme to be moved forward. This is the only reason they want children to return to school.</p>
<p>(If it is at all possible, I would strongly advise not sending your child back.)</p>
<p>Within a couple of weeks, the \'flu mist will have shed all over the country, creating a tidal wave of ill health - as it does every year, but expect this year\'s vaccine to be turbocharged with nastiness - and hey presto, there\'s your &quot;second wave&quot;.</p>
<p>Schools will then be closed nationwide, permanently. They are, we will be told, too dangerous to ever re-open, and all teaching will be moved online (I\'ve posted about this before: <a href="https://miriaf.webs.com/apps/blog/show/48836324-schools-brave-new-normal-">https://miriaf.webs.com/apps/blog/show/48836324-schools-brave-new-normal-</a> ).</p>
<p>The country will then declare a state of emergency and a second, much more draconian lockdown will be imposed at the end of September, of the sort going on in Australia now. No leaving your house for ANY reason, not even to exercise. State operatives going door-to-door to check you\'re inside. Huge on-the-spot fines for anyone found breaking &quot;the rules&quot;.</p>
<p>Then, the coronavirus vaccine will debut - the most dangerous vaccine ever produced in human history, which is a position even held by many pro-vaccine advocates. The wall-to-wall propaganda and marketing for this vaccine will be extraordinary, and the pressure to receive it, enormous. Millions will, and then the country - already in compromised health from the shedding \'flu mist - will see mass illness and death on a scale never before experienced. The extra hospitals will be full (with the death-trap, organ-harvesting ventilators getting plenty of use, now that the state owns your organs*), and at that point, entirely unlike now, we will all personally know people who are affected.</p>
<p>We have already been told the vaccine won\'t be a &quot;magic bullet&quot; (after all, we have a \'flu vaccine, and the \'flu is still responsible for mass illness and death every year), so they will drag out the same script to explain why vaccinated people are dropping like flies - &quot;the virus mutated&quot; - &quot;it would have been much worse if you weren\'t vaccinated&quot; - &quot;anti-vaxxers are compromising herd immunity&quot; - rinse and repeat, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>At that point, the country will be on its knees in a state of trauma and terror and certainly in no mood to celebrate Christmas, which will be cancelled. Visiting family banned. Christmas lights and attractions called off. And of course, no singing carols, because this, as we know, spreads the virus. </p>
<p>You can also factor in food shortages, power cuts, and a breakdown in law and order (the government has already promised us riots that will entirely eclipse those of 2011 in their severity) as the entire infrastructure of the country collapses.</p>
<p>By the time we get into early 2021, the ruthless assault on the psyche of the (surviving) people will be such that they will be stunned and defeated with trauma, prepared to do anything to feel safe and never experience this horror again. They will agree to chipping, tracking, tracing, monitoring, constant surveillance and vaccination - anything! Just don\'t make us live through this horror again!</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not, my pretties,&quot; the criminally insane overlords will cackle. &quot;Just do exactly as we say, always and forever, and we promise you protection and security. Now, here\'s your latest injection of sterilising carcinogenic neurotoxins to keep you safe, because we love you. Sorry about bulldozing your house, by the way.&quot;&quot;</p>',

            Ultimately, these pricks are all business people. Although some harbor extreme ideologies. So what this theory is missing is a motivation. Why? I can think of a few minor benefits. But aside from those few, I'm left with simply serving their dark lord and Master, who I'm told is intent on death and destruction. But come on. Even Pelosi isn't that enterprising.

             There are too many people. It's 11d chess to raise the standard of living of the few who survive the purge. Imagine if there were only 10 million or so people. The wealth that would be available to all would dwarf Jeff bezos.

              Look around you!!  Cleanup your act.  Repent, and accept Jesus Christ because the ONLY WAY you will see clearly is with the Holy Spirit. Read the BIBLE! King James.
             </p>

              This comment above is going to happen and until Jesus Christ returns....Satan rules Earth and knows his time is short as the veil is lifting. Masks, fake virus, natural disasters -flooding, locusts, lighting fires, earthquakes, bombs, etc...ALL WARNINGS!!
             </p>
             <p>
              Jesus Christ is eternal life which means when you pass...you live beyond. If you do not have Jesus Christ, you will go to eternal damnation...like Satan and his demons that are in power over us.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have been researching for 5 years now. I am now a follower of Jesus Christ and I know this, he is the way, the truth and the life. With Jesus you gain discernment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously urge you all to do this for your own souls. No man can save you -TRUST NO MAN!! It states this is the Bible too.
             </p>
             <p>
              God is the Alpha/Omega the Beginning/the end. Through Jesus Christ you will be saved.
             </p>
             <p>
              Revelations is now.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone can accept Jesus.
             </p>
             <p>
              The churches have been compromised.

               Based. By the way, you won't be saved in this life, but your soul will go to heaven for eternity, so it's totally worth all the suffering you will bring on yourself by faithfully following Christ's teaching of nonviolence and sexual abstinence.

                You make no sense. Faith in Jesus Christ  and following the Ten Commandments. Everyone suffers on Earth as Satan rules Earth until Jesus comes back for judgement.
               </p>
               <p>
                Perhaps you should start reading the Bible.
               </p>
               <p>
                Jesus Christ is the way, the truth and the life. That way to God is through him.

                By the Yeshua is a Hebrew curse word and many use this thinking they’re calling in Jesus-NOPE.

                I don't know if you are trolling or your question is genuine, but assuming it is genuine, the answer is that anyone who visits these conspiracy boards and has read everything about the virus up until now, will continuously run these scenarios in their head. "What are they up to next?". "What is their next move?". You can pick any scenario resembling the OP one, and call it "barely conspiratorial". Don't take it so literally - it means we all run these scenarios, and anyone at this point should expect some sort of shit to happen. If you don't, you've not spent enough time on this board. Capiche?

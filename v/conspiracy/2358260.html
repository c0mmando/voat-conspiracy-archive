            It's not only vaccines, this realm is a mental asylum in hell.
           </p>
           <pre><code>  Why the hell are people still fine with working eight or twelve hours per day, with the advancement in technology humanity made in the past decades? That just makes no sense to me, with the technology we have nowadays, people shouldn't work for more than three hours a day, doing a job, that is acually beneficial for the society, instead of slaving away for peanuts in pointless, artificially created jobs, whose main purpose is just to tie the human being to an action it hates, producing stress and negative emotions, which in turn only increase the collective suffering created by humanity. People spend most of their time in these genocidal conditions, then commute for a few hours, only to end their day with poisons of their choice - alcohol, tv, stronger drugs, just to relieve some of the insane stress they have accumulated and for which they have no other adequate outlet.

As I understand it, humanity is actually a part of one bigger organism, a similar organization to a beehive or an anthill, and our current situation of living in a regime, where making unscrupulous profits from everybody else at any cost, especially at the cost of our environment will inevitably kill all of us, including the womb we live in - that's right, the place we call "planet Earth", is actually very similar to a womb, and we are similar to a fetus, we were lied about the shape of cosmos and about the shape of our planet, we are living INSIDE of it, in a CLOSED SYSTEM, from which the only escape is to elevate the minds of all the humanity, instead of forcing everybody do suicidal and harmful actions.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            The destruction of humanity starts already before conception, women are swallowing poisonous and DNA degenerating drugs and anticonception, they are forced to study useless information in schools, they are made to compete with men, instead of naturally coexisting, and they are peer pressured to wait with having a child in their thirties, which is so insane, it's crazy, it was somehow allowed to manifest in this reality. We are what we eat, and we are the only species, that actually worsens the condition of the food we put in our bodies, by using chemical fertilisers and genetically manipulated foodstoffs, filled with antibiotics, we are further limiting the abilities of our DNA, the thermal processing of food is even further lowering the quality, especially with the humanity being forced to eat something our bodies weren't designed for. - For more information about diet look for books by Arnold Ehret or for youtube clips by John Rose. Our toilets are designed with an evil intent in mind as well - we are made to sit at a 90 degrees angle, which makes it more difficult for us to get rid of the food we ate, the only correct position while on the toilet is to SQUAT. - With that being said, let's return to the pregnant women, so this woman who has been mass fed poisons from all sources for about thirty years of her life and who had countless sexual intercourses with various men(look up TELEGONY), then suddenly decides to have a child, - and now think, how can a woman produce a healthy child, that allows for an advanced soul to be put in that body????? There is now that is possible, and that's why there are so many sick, degenerated children coming to this world. A woman is supposed to live a healthy, stress free life in nature, tying herself willingly to one man of her choice, for the rest of her life, with the best age for pregnancy, being about one year after the first menstruation.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Another problem is our healthcare system, let's take again the example of birth giving, the woman is made to go through idiotic, pointless, invasive examinations of the fetus, which she carries, by stranger soaked in an atmosphere of death at places of extremely negative emotions - hospitals are gathering places of suffering, completely unfitting for an expectant mother, women are being forced to bring their child to this world in a strange environment, surrounded by stressed people, who just want to do their job and be done with it, women are forced to give a birth in an unnatural position, which makes birth painful and prolonged, they should be giving a birth at home, in the presence of older, experienced women, in a natural squatting position or in water. After a child is born in a hospital, it is snatched by strangers, filled with demonic larvae, removed from the mother, their natural life support system - placenta - is forcibly and cruelly removed to make profits for the lunatics that own medical and cream companies. THE SENSE OF THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE IS MAKING ME ABSOLUTELY CRAZY, HOW THE HELL IS THIS ALLOWED TO OCCUR???? In the worst case the children are being vaccinated with unidentified substances, including toxic chemicals and severely mentally traumatised for the rest of their lives during the pointless procedure of genital mutilation. HOW CAN WE CALL THIS REALM ANYTHING ELSE BUT A HELL???

Another crazy problem is the history we learn in schools, it is a completely fabricated fairy tale, artificially prolonging our existence in this place and moving us away from the truth about what really happened in the past(look up Fomenko, Nosovsky; Alexey Kungurov, newearth channel on youtube,...), filling our minds with nonsense, making us identify with these containers, we call bodies, that we live in, we are not our bodies, they are just tools for us to interact with the outer realm.

           <p>
            Additional insanity, that everybody is OK with is using so called "fossil fuels", which are no fossil fuels, those are, as I understand it, actually bodily remains of our ancestors, who lived cca 200 years ago and who were annihilated by some outside force, that proceeded to modify the remaining containers, we now live in - thus enslaving us. Get it through your minds - each time you use something, that was created from "fossil fuels", you are actually touching something made from dead humanoids - absolute insanity, especially when they package food and water in these containers. Our ancestors never needed to mine for minerals or metals, they were actually somehow manifesting these resources and producing them, what we mine today, is just remains of their technology, which produced these goods. Another absolute insanity is cutting down trees for furniture or construction industry - it takes at least 40 years for a tree to grow in healthy conditions, to be of any use  in these industries, so WHY THE HELL DO PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S OK TO CUT DOWN TREES?????? TREES ARE THE MAIN THING THAT KEEPS US ALIVE AND IN FINE LIVING CONDITIONS, THEIR ACTIVITY DIRECTLY INFLUENCES TEMPERATURE OF THIS REALM,ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, GIVES US HEALTHY FOOD, STABILIZIES THE GAS MAKEUP OF WHAT WE BREATH.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Now I've ventilated about what I believe are some of the main problems we face as a humanity, so it's time for some solutions that according to me could help balance our situation. First of all, it's pointless to overtly attack these so called "politicians" and "world leaders" that are being promenated to us as the main bosses in this realm, it's all BS, they are nothing but ACTORS, INCLUDING TRUMP AND PUTIN, DOING WHAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD, BY ENTITIES WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT - NO ELECTIONS ARE ACTUALLY BEING HELD, THEY ARE ALL SELECTED, ALL YOU DO DURING THE ELECTION PROCESS IS THAT YOU GIVE AWAY YOUR VOICE(YOU ACCEPT THEM TO BE YOUR MASTERS) TO THE REAL CONTROLLERS, MAKING THEM INNOCENT OF ALL THEIR CRIMES TOWARDS YOU, BECAUSE YOU PLAYED BY THEIR RULES. I DIDN'T VOTE, AND ANYTHING THAT CAUSES HARM TO MY DEVELOPMENT WILL BE FULLY PAYED BY THE CULPRITS. STOP PLAYING BY THEIR RULES.

            A power should be given to people who are the best in this world in the area of natural agriculture, to devise plans to massively replant our whole planet with fruit trees, making vegetable gardens and such.
  People who are the most knowledgable in this world about diet, should be given the power to devise plans about what food is actually most suited for humans and under what conditions.
  Healthcare needs to be completely revamped, to focus on eliminating bad lifestyle habits, instead of filling people with poisions pills, that only cover the symptoms.
  Large cities (more than 10,000 inhabitants) need to be completely redesigned or left and new settlements created, where people locally care for each other and grow their own local food, instead of having to eat something that was grown half a world away, under completely different naturel conditions.
  The workday should be no longer than four hours, and all pointless jobs, that only produce stress, kill time and destroy the environment need to be abolished.
  There has to be a complete educational reform of all subjects, and the way they are being taught to the children, because they serve as nothing, but slave forming tools.
  Humanity needs to focus more on a natural development and co-existence with nature, instead of going down the blind road of "technical progress", which is only designed to degenerate our natural senses, if people lived in harmony with nature, instead of using so much technical prosthetics, we would be already telephatic and we would have more "supernatural" abilities.
  The logic of our thinking needs to be changed from YES, NO logic to a continuous logic.

             Families with vaccine-damaged children are being bullied into silence
            </a>
            Why, if vaccines are so "safe" and "beneficial," are the whistle-blowers being bullied into silence?  Why wouldn't they, in the spirit of safety, conduct more ($$) testing and do so through independent laboratories - not sponsored by big pharma?

            <p>
             What I think they won't say is it's for the greater good and they accept a few that get hurt compared to to many that don't.

             The CDC themselves openly admit that "poorly constructed research studies" are a major problem, though they don't seem to care enough to actually do anything about that. They're just saying it to cover the asses in the future.

            <p>
             Furthermore, there is really no valid recourse for people that would like to sue. In '88 the US passed a law that established a "
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
              vaccine court
             </a>
             ," that pretty much insures the entire pharmaceutical industry against lawsuits, all payed for by a 75 cent tax on all vaccines. The VICP was established to override the jury system, and makes it completely impossible to file lawsuits against the pharma companies themselves. Because of this law, any injury related to a vaccine will be dismissed from all civil courts, state and federal. VICP is the only option.
            </p>
            <p>
             The the credit of the VICP, victims have received something like 3.3Bn dollars across 5338 cases since 1988 according to [this](https://archive.is/PIBXR source). While its better than nothing, the works out to where the average settlement is ~$630,000. Is 630k is supposed to cover it? Hell, lots of functional adults won't retire at 60 if they have 630k, how is that supposed to covers someone for life?
            </p>

             Its a sad world we live in.

             influenza vaccine

            is strongly encouraged for nearly everyone over the age of 6 months. About 170 million doses were expected to be produced for the U.S. market during the 2015/2016 flu season, compared to 32 million in 1990.

            Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza reduces protective immunity against more virulent strains. People who are naturally exposed to circulating influenza viruses (the unvaccinated) frequently gain cross-protection against other strains of the disease.

             HPV vaccine clinical trials design, and data interpretation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, were largely inadequate. Additionally, we note evidence of selective reporting of results from clinical trials. Given this, the widespread optimism regarding HPV vaccines long-term benefits appears to rest on a number of unproven assumptions and significant misinterpretation of available data.
            </p>
            <p>
             Likewise, the notion that HPV vaccines have an impressive safety profile is only supported by highly flawed design of safety trials and is contrary to accumulating evidence from vaccine safety surveillance databases and case reports which continue to link HPV vaccination to serious adverse outcomes (including death and permanent disabilities).

            <p>
             We thus conclude that further reduction of cervical cancers might be best achieved by optimizing cervical screening (which carries no such risks) and targeting other factors of the disease rather than by the reliance on vaccines with questionable efficacy and safety profiles.

             Chickenpox
            </a>
            is a contagious disease caused by infection with varicella zoster virus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine">
             chickenpox vaccine
            </a>
            was introduced in 1995, it was common for doctors to recommend exposing children to the disease because it is generally benign in childhood and complication rates increase when it is contracted by teenagers or adults.
           </p>
           <p>
            When people regain their health after contracting chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body. Later, when immunity weakens, the virus can become active again and cause
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles">
             shingles
            </a>
            , also known as herpes zoster.
           </p>
           <p>
            Immunity against shingles is strengthened by periodic exposures to the varicella virus. Before the chickenpox vaccine, frequent encounters with the varicella virus boosted antibody protection against shingles. Although chickenpox cases decreased after the introduction of the vaccine, this restricted opportunities to reinforce immunity and increased the rate of shingles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Medical costs, pain, and suffering associated with shingles generally are much greater than with chickenpox. To address this problem, the maker of the chickenpox vaccine,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co.">
             Merck &amp; Co.

            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to causing a dramatic rise in shingles,
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22659447/">
             the vaccine becomes less effective as rates increase
            </a>
            . This is due to a reduction in opportunities for natural boosts to immunity which occur from exposure to people who are shedding the wild varicella virus.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the prelicensure era, 95% of adults experienced natural chickenpox (usually as children)--these cases were usually benign and resulted in long-term immunity. Varicella vaccination is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in prevaccine communities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be cost-effective as increased herpes zoster morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease. Universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide long-term protection from varicella zoster virus disease.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored and promoted studies that showed positive outcomes of varicella vaccination but opposed, and attempted to block, publication of findings that were critical of the vaccination program.

           <p>
            Ideally, vaccines would provide perfect protection that lasts forever. However, vaccines are imperfect; they confer incomplete immunity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mounting evidence indicates that vaccines designed to
            <em>

            </em>
            the growth rate of pathogens within their hosts produce conditions that actually

             increase

            pathogen virulence, ultimately preventing eradication of the disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disease-causing organisms strive to maximally infect their hosts without killing them. Vaccines induce the targeted pathogen to adapt and evolve in unintended ways, creating undesirable disease outcomes in individuals and entire host populations.
           </p>

            We must confiscate legally purchased "assault weapons" from law abiding citizens so we'll all be safer from criminals with "assault weapons". Dont worry, if something happens the police will protect you just like they did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas H.S. ! I just have one question , what is an assault rifle ? Is it a "scary" looking rifle ? Is it a semi automatic , you know pull the trigger and one round fires ? Is it anything but a black powder musket ? If I use my car and run down and kill several people at once is my car an "assault vehicle " ? I really want to know.

             Completely agree!  I used this to answer a commenter on social media, just like your though process I had posed the same question about what defines an assault rifle?  Later got into specifics, but one was is it just if their black and scary looking, what if their pink?  The car analogy I refer to also quite frequently because vehicles have also been used purposely to kill people in crowds.  I keep trying, but sometimes I realize their either going to see logic, or they're not.

              Unfortunately, when dealing with the mental disorder of liberalism, facts and logic and even common sense are useless. Its all about FEELINGS and optics.

            What’s funny is that side will threaten legal gun owners, saying they “will take guns away from their cold dead hands.” But nothing ever about the gang bangers and organized crime who have guns. No ones ever said “were gonna go in to Chicago and take the guns away”

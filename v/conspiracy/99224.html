            For a good portion of people, that's pretty much the best of both worlds if you don't want children. Natural sweetener and contraceptive!

            If true, this is horribly depressing for me (especially as a Type-1 Diabetic since I was 4).
           </p>
           <p>
            As a Type-1 Diabetic since the age 4, I have had the displeasure of ingesting nearly every artificial sweetener to hit the market in an effort to enjoy on occasion some of the foods that my family &amp; friends regularly get to.  Call it what you will, but drinking a Soda or eating a piece of candy becomes something you really envy others over sometimes in this situation.  All of the artificial options always had some nasty side-effects when I used them; diarrhea, horrible after-tastes, horrible headache, etc.  Then along came Stevia..
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought we found the holy grail, because none of those negatives of the artificial options hit me when trying out Stevia-based foods we made with it, and then after some time, some of the newer food-products the were using it beginning to hit the market.  The added-bonus of it being plant-based also being highly appealing vs. artificial sweeteners being "created".
           </p>
           <p>
            Now though, I'm going to have to reconsider and dig into this with some heavy research from here before continuing use... bah!

             Focus on mitigating your symptoms by using other herbs to help regulate your blood sugar, cinnamon for example, but there are others.  Then you can get away with a little raw cane sugar.

             If you are a male afaik from what was said, (I haven't drilled down into these weirdos books) it shouldn't really effect you, it's the females according to their writings who would drink a brew of it every day to prevent pregnancy.

            If everyone had a few stevia plants, we wouldn't need artificial sweeteners or sugar.  They are sooo sweet you hardly need to use any at all.  Kinda the same as marijuana.  If everyone had one we would drastically decrease our need for pharmaceuticals.

            Human Race.  Get off your knees and start farming again.  That's where true power comes from.  Knowing that you take care of YOUR OWN food supply is real FREEDOM..  Take charge of your life.  Don't depend on big pharma or the grocery stores to do it for you.

             Did you even pay attention to what was said here? Sure Stevia is fine if you aren't trying to get pregnant, otherwise stay away from it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think if people want to use this as a contraceptive instead of the harsh big pharma ones go for it, before they realize you know and ban it's over the counter sale.

              Wow.  I normally read the article before commenting.  Sadly I made my comment before looking at the link.  I ass-umed I knew what the article was about.  I was wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seems like a natural contraceptive that may be harmful. Most of what I said was true, take out stevia and put in beet sugar :)

              Thanks for the reply.

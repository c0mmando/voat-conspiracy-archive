            “…the [CDC] co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the [MMR vaccine] study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.” (William Thompson, CDC researcher)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On July 29,
             <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4546421/rep-bill-posey-calling-investigation-cdcs-mmr-reasearch-fraud">
              US Congressman Bill Posey made his last stand on the floor of the House
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted five minutes to speak, he laid bare the lying of the CDC in a now-famous 2004 study that exonerated the MMR vaccine and claimed it had no connection to autism.
            </p>
            <p>
             “No connection to autism” was the lie.
            </p>
            <p>
             Congressman Posey read a statement from
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/cdc-whistleblower-revealed-william-thompson/">
              long-time CDC researcher William Thompson
             </a>
             , one of the authors of the
             <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">
              2004 Pediatrics study
             </a>
             designed to determine, once and for all, whether the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine could cause autism.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-big-one-cdc-whistleblower-goes-public-now/">
              Thompson saw and participated in violating the protocol of the study
             </a>
             . He was there. He helped his co-authors destroy documents that would have shown an MMR-autism link.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can see a rush transcript of Congressman Posey’s remarks
             <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/07/breaking-news-congressman-posey-on-house-floor-cdc-authors-of-2004-mmr-paper-destroyed-documents.html">
              here
             </a>
             (on the ageofautism.com website), which includes his reading of a statement from whistleblower Thompson.
            </p>
            <p>
             Posey pleads with his colleagues for a Congressional investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of note: two of the CDC researchers on the infamous 2004 study, who according to Thompson, destroyed vital documents, are
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/new-cdc-whistleblower-video-more-autism-fraud/">
              Coleen Boyle
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/cnn-asks-serial-lying-liar-to-comment-on-the-cdc-whistleblower-scandal/">
              Frank DeStefano
             </a>
             . They are both high-ranking executives at the CDC in the area of vaccine safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             This calls into question every single CDC study, under their tenure, that claims vaccines are safe.
            </p>
            <p>
             CDC whistleblower Thompson’s statement, which Posey read on the House floor, includes this bombshell:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “However, because I [Thompson] assumed it [destroying the documents] was illegal and would violate both FOIA and DOJ requests, I kept hard copies of all documents in my office and I retained all associated computer files. I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draft of the Pediatrics paper.”
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Thompson has the smoking-gun documents. So does Congressman Posey. I believe others do as well.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <h2>
            So: publish them. Publish them now.
           </h2>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             There are lawsuits to be filed. Eleven years have passed since the CDC committed its crime of concealing the MMR vaccine-autism connection. How many parents, never informed of the truth, have permitted their children to receive this vaccine? How many children have been struck down by the vaccine?
            </p>
            <p>
             The lawsuits should be filed against the CDC and the individual authors of the 2004 study. Lawyers must depose every CDC employee who had knowledge of the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             And what about the fact that the MMR vaccine is one of the shots that has been mandated, by law,
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/mandatory-vaccination-california-is-ordering-genetic-alteration/">
              in California
             </a>
             , in other states, and in
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/australia-vaccine-war-update-the-people-slaves-to-the-state/">
              Australia
             </a>
             ?
            </p>
            <p>
             Mandating neurological destruction of children is a crime that must be investigated and punished. If these states (and other countries) insist on keeping the MMR on their schedules, they are guilty parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here, for background,
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/category/autism/">
              are earlier articles I wrote about whistleblower Thompson
             </a>
             , starting when the story broke in the summer of 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
             Understand what we are dealing with here, in terms of public exposure: the author of a peer-reviewed and published study; the author who has worked for many years at the CDC; the author who participated in destruction of vital documents; the author has come forward and admitted his crime and the crime of his colleagues. This kind of confession never happens.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              But it did happen.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             And this story and what it means must not die, no matter how major media outlets try to spin it or ignore it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Parents who are, in ignorance, allowing their children to receive the MMR vaccine, must be informed.
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQT5dS6mq4U">
              They must know what is going on
             </a>
             . They must know the danger to their children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Germany, France, India, China, South Africa…wherever the MMR vaccine is given…parents must be made aware they’re gambling with their children’s lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/open-letter-to-australian-pm-tony-abbott-the-mmr-vaccine/">
              Government officials anywhere in the world
             </a>
             who make this continuing crime possible are liable.
            </p>
            <p>
             So are manufacturers of the MMR.
            </p>
            <p>
             Get busy. Expose the truth.

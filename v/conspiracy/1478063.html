            I find the whole flat earth theory very fascinating at the same level as another highly controversial conspiracy...vaccines.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally don't believe the earth is flat but no matter how much I try, I personally cannot disprove it. The only evidence (for lack of a better word) I have is the same as what everyone has been taught/shown. There's photos of a curved surface but I cannot prove without a shadow of a doubt that they are not real any more than any regular citizen can prove they are real.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have tried every time I have flown to see if I could see the earth's curve and never could. Even that high up, the curvature of the earth is not visible. I'm fully aware that that doesn't prove or disprove the flat earth theory. That's kind of my point. We (the average earthling) has absolutely no way of proving that the earth is flat or the earth is a ball. We can only go by what we've been told and which theory we want to believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the flat earth drawings (sorry, I'm too lazy to look them up now, but can be found on the web) don't show it as
            <strong>
             completely
            </strong>
            flat. It's curved in the middle. So from space we could still take photos of the earth's curve.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Vaccines - I love this controversial conspiracy as well. Again, not one single average earthling can prove or disprove that vaccines are completely safe and are for the benefit of humankind.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do believe that some vaccines are good for the flu, measles, etc. but I also believe that when you have a government that are a bunch of illuminati/satan worshiping a-holes who's sole purpose is to bring the world population down to 500 million, what other crap are they putting in those vaccines? The average human being has no clue and they never will. However, you will find the average person eats up what the government tells them on MSM and anyone who even questions if vaccines are bad are just plain retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government/corporations have been lying to us forever. Now studies are showing that not only is there absolutely no benefit to the human body in fluoride, but that it's now considered a neurotoxin.
           </p>
           <p>
            They grow a lot of our food in a petri dish and the the food that's grown in the ground is sprayed with Roundup weed killer. Now some scientists are saying that the Zika virus is not actually a virus but is caused by the chemicals in Roundup. That is yet another conspiracy theory out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, they poison our water and poison our food, but they're legit on the vaccines...right?
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on forever, but I've already turned this into a full blown novel. The bottom line is the average human being will never know the real truth on these or just about any other conspiracy theory. That's why it's a theory. It's no different than asking "what's your opinion on abortion?" They are just that...opinions and can't be
            <strong>
             proven
            </strong>
            either way.

             I am always willing to discuss subjects like flat earth. I have a treasure trove of info on the subject, but info is hard to find as FE is THE MOST controversial of all subjects. If you try to find info on your own, know that the Flat Earth Society and others are part of a psyop to make us legit FE researchers look like crazy crack pots.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now on the subject of vaccines, I kinda forgot about that one, but you are right, it is controversial, mostly because if conspiracy theorist are right about this, it means parents took the wrong decision about the well-being of their own kids and it's just too much to handle for most humans. Cognitive dissonance.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know about the Georgia Guidestones and the plan to reduce global population to half a billion and I think, like you, that some vaccines are good and some are bad. They proved their point that vaccines were effective and from there on, you cannot imply that this particular one might be bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             One last thing, Cancer and its treatment. I cannot remove the idea from my head that the hospitals are killing citizens, knowingly or not. (Probably not knowingly, I think doctors think they are really helping save lives). I remember my mother in law, she was full of life on the day they told her she had cancer. From that point on, I saw the life being drained from her day after day on that hospital bed. She died couple weeks later.

            I think the Flat Earth ones real hard to touch, it basically would prove that everything is a lie, and thats too much for allot of people to swallow. I dont believe either way, it does bring up some good questions though, our globes and our maps dont accurately represent the earth thats foresure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its also really hard to say anything about the Zionists, people have been straight up conditioned to not say anything bad about jews, and its gone a bit too far when we cant ask even some simple obvious questions without being labelled anti-semite.
           </p>
           <p>
            The swiss conspiracy is a good one, truth is theres a ton of tiny countries with questionable histories.

             Read my other answers on flat earth. Everything IS a lie.
            </p>
            <p>
             The zionist connection is irrefutable at this point. We can talk about everything except jews because...you know...they suffered. You guys in the US are not aware of everything that is happening in France but there was this guy Dieudonne who got absolutely destroyed for just hinting at a connection with jews. He is now pretty antisemitic but they basically brought him there. He wasnt lying when he said that "he is not rascist because he is a human being period".
            </p>
            <p>
             About the little countries, that's a good one. We should definitely look at places like Monaco, Im sure they have some skeleton in their closets. Pizzagate HAS to expose all the pedo lords in ALL countries but some connections won't be found because of the language barrier. I can help with the french language if it can help anyone.

               Would that really stop you? It's like saying the mountain is higher that you expected. Information is there but ANY media outlet that has more than 1000 subscribers has been compromised. At some point you get that phone call you know.

                   The thing is: They made us believe this story where barbaric people believed the earth was flat because of their books, someone intelligent tried to prove that it could be a globe but the nasty churches who wanted to keep their control executed the guy for heresy. Years later another guy comes in with better "proof" of said globe earth and at some point the church has no choice but to retract. You know...computers, planes and sattelites work so you cant deny our science at this point.

                    Its funny but the Church every now and again completely goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction of what it did and believed in for thousands of years before. Whats interesting is allot of high ranking Islamic leaders are calling the globe earth blasphemy, like the catholic leaders were 1000's of years ago, telling people not to believe the lies about a globe earth. What interests me is how the flat earth and hollow earth theories can coexist. The hollow earth theories I find more interesting actually, if you are interested in occult and paranormal. Its quite strange, the two theories that get laughed at the most are the two I'm most interested in at the moment.

                     You know what? When I think about conspiracies, I often think I've seen them all, but that is one that I kept rejecting because it seems just so bat-shit crazy. Then again, I remember what I thaught of flat earth 6 month ago, so I'll give it a try I promise.

                      My friend made a really good point about how the hollow earth theories are really difficult to discuss because people will mock you as one of those flat earthers. It made me think, what if the hollow earthers are right and the flat earth theories are there to discredit hollow earth theories. Its a crazy world we live in, what can I say.

            just curious, do you believe in god? I was reading your response to someone else and wanted to comment. I don't believe in aliens or ufo's either. I believe anything of that kind are just demons and are in disguise as, or have been misinterpreted as aliens

             I was born unbaptised, got baptised at 11 (yeah I know thats weird they forced me to get baptised so I could sing in church at my shcool), raised catholic but at 13 decided to study all religions which brought me to conclude that I would be hindu if I would have been born in India and would be muslim if I was born in Soudi Arabia so I concluded that all religions were crap. Fast forward 20 years, my life goes to shit and I find god...inside of me. Anyway I've been looking for truth all my life and I don't care if it has to take me back to parts of christianity like the firmamen. I wish things were different but God does not care what we think. Reality is here and I just want to understand it more.

            I guess a good one is that the whole NSA mass surveillance programming and capabilities stuff, is a lie put out by the government because the chilling effect of having people believe that these are their capabilities would benefit them in terms of controlling the narrative in society. Extinguishing the sparks that become revolutionary fires by having people self police their own expression of thoughts.  That the people that are really at the top have very little power in actuality and instead keep control of power by pulling a reverse emperors new cloak on the population. Contraversial because if true it undermines the basis of a lot of the other NWO based conspiracies etc.

            Basically the world in my opinion is based on magic. The ones who rule use the most magic for themselves currently. The paradigm is near shift because the world goes through changes.

            The world IMO is best seen as a duality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything good and in order is one duality, combined with that is low freedom to do what you want, imagine perfection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then imagine complete disorder, you could do whatever you want and would have maximum freedom.
           </p>
           <p>
            We never go to the full extreme ever but the world is made by major dualities unexplainable by words and we go back and forth between them. It is not so much we should look at ourselves but moreso look at ourselves and how we have been shaped.
           </p>
           <p>
            We create our reality with our frame of mind because we reject things and accept others based on our knowledge and beliefs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more you change yourself the more freely you will have will to do whatever you wish and have no fear of judgement.
           </p>
           <p>
            The world is a movie currently and we can hardly change it. You can only find your place inside. Make your perspective optimal and be ready to change environments. Always learn more and find opportunity. Keep moving never stop.

             Yes the earth is flat. I know. I know.

             That I cannot certify, but it does seems like it. Anyway, the elite do seem to take interest in anything magical or occult...either because they know it to be true or because even higher level masters are controlling the lower ones with technologies that "look" like magic.
            </p>

             We live inside a virtual reality.
            </p>

             This is not really controversial...not censored anyway. MSM is talking about this and they could be right for once.

            <p>
             I think you are right but again, this is part of easily researchable material in the new age movement and such. That movement has been infiltrated like all others but they do carry some truth.

             To say that I agree would not help research. What if I don't. Everywhere you look they tell you that it is so. I don't know if I believe that.

             Again, you are missing the point. That is easily researchable and is the basis for most of the new age stuff.

             That could be so. But what makes you believe that the whole Snowden story is credible. MSM talked about it....therefore I do not believe any part of it. I think he still receives his CIA paycheck and was part of an act in the big theater.

              By the way, I dismissed most of the "easily researchable stuff" but we can talk more about it if you want. Specifically, say the "magic" aspect. I believe what we see in movies about medieval times and the kings asking for guidance by having their "priests" perform witchcraft, throw some bones on the floor and cut the neck of some animal with a knife...well I think these things are still being done TODAY but this time to win wars, to make deals and win negociations...these kind of things.

              Ed snowden CGI means Edward snowden isn't a real person he's fake invented and only on a computer. Obviously he isn't on the CIA payroll he never exited he is a manufactured person.

            I think pizza gate is controversial  because of the media bias against it, if it wasn't for that, I don't think it would be controversial for people to be doing independent research into a possible pedophile ring that involves government insiders. I do think the idea of a hollow earth inhabited by giants, dislocated Nazis, mammoths and other extinct animals with the exit/entrances at the north and south pole (areas that are blacked out on google earth and that are illegal to fly over) is more controversial than the idea of a flat earth that can be debunked by simply looking at the moon and reasoning that most heavenly bodies are generally spherical in shape.

             About that reasoning: Let me ask you an honest question: If you would wake up naked and attached on the mast of some kind of ship or something, at sea, and you would see 3 destroyers floating in front of you, would you assume you are attached on the mast of a destroyer?

              hmm, I don't know? I don't think it would be unreasonable to think I was on a 'destroyer?' but I definitely would think that whatever I was floating on was  'boat' shaped because that's what gives marine vessels the ability to float on water.

               It is definitely not unreasonable, but then again in no way is it a guaranteed guess. What I'm saying here is that we cannot say the earth is a globe only because we see circular/spherical shapes in the sky. Now lets discuss the other points. The moon. You mean that moon?

                ive done some youtube research on the moon before and heard evidence that the moon is an artificial object placed there for the benefit of earth. evidence like the moons surface being metal and that the moon rang like a bell for an hour when the lunar lander piece crashed back to the surface. and in the math (sorry I cant remember the specifics) of the distance from the earth to the moon, the sun to the earth being equally devisable. I think the idea is compelling along with the idea that we didn't even go to the moon or maybe we did but the footage that we got to see was staged. that being said, in regards to this video, in the absence of another video showing the same phenomena and speaking as someone who is into photography as a hobby, the artifact looks like camera shake from a camera on a tripod. cant speculate on the possible 'ufo' in the beginning of the video though

                 Also you mentionned the moon as being beneficial to the earth. I've read about the opposite too. The moon could be an artifact left there to fuck up the garden of Eden by distorting the "pure" waves of potential coming from saturn and turning them into SIN waves thus leeaving us born into sin. There is this possibility that the moon is the light that we see at the end of our life and that it is some kind of machine that can put your soul back into a new body so that the machine can keep working.

                 Right. Forget the UFO, the idea here is that this video IS historic like the guy claims and has NEVER been refuted or debunked by anyone with credible authority in photographs. Also, it has been replicated 3 times he talks about it on his channel. 3 other people in different states have come forward. There is a video where you can see all the anomalies I will try to find it. Anyway to you have ANY reason AT ALL to believe that you live on a ball that spins and flies in the universe at extreme speeds and that the atmosphere is somehow glued  to this ball because you know ... gravity ... even though it it flying around in a vacuum... yes a vacuum that should be sucking the atmosphere away, but nooooooo, you know, gravity. right. MSM says so.

                  if you find other videos showing the same phenomena, I would be very interested.  the problem about the moon being a hologram (assuming we are not living in the matrix) is tht a hologram is essentially a projection. where is the projection coming from? cant be coming from earth because its spinning (idk if you believe this or not) , cant becoming from the area of the moon because it needs to be far enough away to project  the entirety of the moon. we can observe asteroids and meteors, if something like that flew in between the projector and the projection it would be easily observable and the closer to the projector the bigger the shadow would be. also a hologram needs to be projected onto something, imagine going to a laser light show with no fog machine, it wouldn't look that impressive. do you have a counter theory in terms of the earth being flat and the atmosphere thinning the further you go out. ive seen video of a guy going up in a balloon really high to where the atmosphere is thin and jumps/parachutes out. ive seen this same video used to argue for the flat earth because you cant see the earths curvature

                   Thank you for engaging me in an honest discussion about this. Flat earth is THE MOST sensitive subject, even more than pizzagate. Pizzagate involves kings eating babies, but flat earth means you were dumb enough to believe this shit and so were all your ancestors...its just too much for most people. Cognitive dissonance you know. The first thing we learn is 1+1=2 then we learn that the earth is a globe. These are the 2 certitudes on which our whole world view is constructed. Then you remember these times where you would look at the globe in your classroom and just think of how small you were compared to the world, how much there is to discover, how great your predecessor were to discover and map all this globe. Ahh yes great times. Anyone who dares to question this is IMMEDIATELY ridiculed into oblivion. Makes you wonder no?

                   Yes so back to the subject at hand, the moon.

                   Here is the clip where we see 10 occurences of this weird phenomenon. Not all are filmed with the same cam and same cameraman:

                    I will say that its compelling to see all of this video evidence,but digital cameras can be weird. do you know anything about the moire camera effect. I only really know about it because ive been looking at buying a Fujifilm camera that uses a special x-trans sensor to combat it. the most interesting evidence ,to me anyway, was the curvature in the wave. that would imply that the moons image is projected onto a curved surface. ive know of the mandela effect and when it was re-popularized with the bearenstein bears debate. illuminatimatrix is one of those philosophical debates similar to "is any thing real", "is my whole life a dream/a lie" "is the whole universe and everyone and everything I interact with created for me. its kind of a dues ex machine, its a fun debate, but with no possible way to get evidence for it, I usually leav it alone. I couldn't find a whole lot of info about ocs101 just now, could you tell me more

                     I have more about the moon that was just to get things started. If you are really willing to discover the wonders of flat earth I can point you in the right direction. Know that there is a lot of disinfo on this subject as it is THE MOST controversial of all. You might not find the right info on your own.

                     Mandella effect is cool because I like philosophy, but I wounder where this is going plus MSM is talking about it so Im thinking it must be some kind of satanic shit theyre putting on us.

                     By the way, illuminatimatrix is the name of a site handled by Brian Kemila, not what you are referring to. His work is AMAZING to say the least, but I am warning anyone who dare to delve into this shit: You have to have an extremely open mind to get into this stuff and be willing to throw everything you know out the window. You are in for one hell of a ride. It's like Alice goes down the rabbit hole and finds a warp hole to god. You have to start at page 1 and read that page like 3 times before moving to the next one. There is 100 pages on his site.

                     OCS101 was a pionneer in the Saturn research. RIP. He is very missed on youtube. He started his own site...things are pretty hard to find. His stuff is hard to understand if you are new. If you really want to know more, and you don't mond the intense cussing and talking to his birds, go on his site, look at some stuff, do something else, come back, do that for a week. You will not believe it. His stuff is the best around.

                      if you got more on the moon, ill take it. I think the mandella effect might be used  in the msm to promote their 'fake news'.  in the absence of a real mendalla effect (remembering a different timeline or a different dimensions timeline) it can be used to gaslight people into remembering history the wrong way. why are so many people sympathetic to castro dying( not accounting for the rise in communisms popularity due to Bernie sanders). he who controls the past, controls the future.  I'm into that occult Saturn/satan research, thanks for the links, illuminatimatrix seems like a lot of info to dig thru but on the surface it looks like its worth it. am I navigating the ocs101ark site correctly? it looks like only a handful of stuff is on there with the earliest being from the 7th, only a few days ago. I don't have time to dig  through all this gold right now but I'm excited to get to all the new stuff.  I have to let you go, I don't know where your at but its 3am for me and I only have a couple hours to finish up the work that ive been slacking on all night, and  I want to get home on time  and hopefully before the sun comes up.  thank you, it was good having this conversation with someone who can talk about fringe theories and be rational too. if you want to keep it going, ill check back tomorrow evening after I wake up

                       Bill OCS101 often deletes all his videos. If you want to learn, look at some of his vids, say 2-3 video, then go do something else. Come back 3 days later and do it again. Just listen, absorb the material even if it doesn't make sense. Do that for a month and come back to me. I guarantee you will question your own sanity.

                       I'm always willing to discuss this stuff it was nice having this discussion. I might seem a bit stuburn sometimes but trust me, the thing that makes me the happier is when I learn that I was wrong on something.

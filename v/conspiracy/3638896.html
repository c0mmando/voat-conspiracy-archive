            DDT was banned for very good reasons. That shit is still in the environment and will take many many more years to get rid of it. It remains in the water and everything in the world needs the water. Sure you could bring it back and kill every living thing on the planet. But why would you when there are alternatives. Humans are supposed to learn from our mistakes, not keep repeating them expecting a different result.

            Absolutely correct. When I was a wee lad, the mosquito trucks ran through our neighborhood just before sunset twice each week. All the big kids ran around in the DDT fog just goofing off, with parental blessings. And one day, the trucks stopped coming. Rats. Bugs galore feasted on us all.

            DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was not applied at all in sub-Saharan Africa due to these perceived difficulties. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide

            It was killing the eagles. It made their eggs too thin, and the eggs got crushed when the mother birds sat on them to keep them warm. That's reason enough to ban the stuff, as far as I'm concerned.

             People used to be awful with respect wildlife. Folks would go out "hunting" when I was a kid and just freaking shoot everything that moved. Woodpeckers, chipmunks, and hawks everything was fair game.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back then my parents and myself were considered bleeding hearts when we said that folks should just kill things that weren't endangered, and actually use the game to eat.  Now the whole thing has been taken to another level.  The deer in my back yard are just stinking neighborhood pets, that make it impossible to grow a garden. They are fed so much they are obese, and have probably have high blood pressure from all the salt blocks.  Let's not even talk about the geese.  But you even say so much as boo to one someone will call the DNR on you.

             That turned out to be wrong.  Friend of mine actually took a course in ornithology  taught by Heinz Meng, probably America's  foremost authority on birds of prey and asked the  man point blank in front of thirty people  in the classroom and the guy said the case against DDT for killing eagles was BS.  He said the reason hawks and eagles came back after the sixties was that farmers had started keeping chickens in cages by that time  and you didn't see hawks and eagles flying off with chickens after thatn.

            DDT eliminated BEDBUGS. I grew up thinking that "don't let the bedbugs bite" was just some stupid fairy tale shit like the Easter bunny, or the boogy man.  If you had asked Americans what bedbugs were in 1983, they would have told you they were fiction!
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't until the last few years thanks to the elimination of DDT and the street shitters taking over hotels, did they come back.  I hear DDT can still be bought on the dark web.

              Where have you been for the last 10 years? Just research. There are actually several of them, perhaps many of them (it's a rabbit hole).  The one you often heard referenced is the TOR ... onion router.

           I just finished watching a scene on Netflix that caught my attention.. it has been said that the Illuminati say things in plain sight, as well as in codes, but sometimes it is blatantly obvious as a mocking gesture.

           A women asks him where he's from. He says "Hawaii, Indonesia, Kenya, take your pick" she says a Kenyan phrase, he says really? and teases her, but then proceeds to say, I dont understand what you said, I've never been to Kenya, I take it you have.

            Well, I moved 7 times before I was 10 years old.  When people ask where i am from, I say, "well, take your pick.  Well, I was born outside St. Louis, but I'm not really FROM anywhere, i moved 7 times before I was 10."
           </p>

            "oh, was your father military?"  is the normal/usual response.
           </p>
           <p>
            For a kid who was moved around a lot as a child like Obama was, and was finally ditched with his grandparents, yeah, I can see this response as being in the norm, or if not the norm, I at least can relate.  It's a hard question to answer when you don't have a hometown.

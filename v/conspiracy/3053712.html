            It could be spread deliberately but there's no need, it's doing a great job by itself.  Some was spread accidentally by people transferring different types of deer for deer farms, where people go to fenced in areas to hunt.  CWD escaped the enclosure, either by deer escaping or by being eaten by a predator.  Wolves and other predators can transmit it, supposedly without being affected by it.
           </p>

            It can be spread through feces and urine.  It can persist in the ground and inside plants for 20 years or more (probably more if its out of the sunlight).
           </p>
           <p>
            Finland (I think), had the problem with reindeer many years ago, and they seemingly solved the problem by killing every reindeer and not reintroducing them for about 20 years.  The only way to really get rid of it would be to kill every animal that the prions can reproduce in, and not reintroduce them for 30 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            It takes a long time for the disease to show up, and some people could possibly be affected by it.

             Wrong !!!
There are no findings to date that show that CWD can be transmitted from deer to humans
It resides in the brain and the spinal column of the deer, not the meat.
The glan that is cut out and tested i located near where the spianal column and the brain connect.
CWD has been around for decades in the county i hunt in , but until recently TWRA didn't have the funds to test for it.
When they finally had the funds, the morons waited until deer season was half way over before they began testing for it, they extended the hunting season an additional month but you had to purchase an additional permit to hunt during that period
The way they introduced the testing screwed over those in the deer processing business, because you have to take the deer to a testing location after you have tagged it online, they remove the gland and send it off to be tested, in the mean time your take your deer to the processor and then wait on the word whether the deer you killed was infected.
What is happening is that people who's deer have tested positive or didn't have their deer tested before the deadline are refusing to pick up their deer and leaving the processor holding the bag.
On TWRA's website you have to do an extensive search to find where it says it is not harmful to humans.
This information should have been located on the same web page that gives you the FAQ's about the disease.

            The masters must have determined that deer would haven-be an important food source for people living outside the masters' sphere of control; thus the solution from their perspective is to simply kill all the deer.

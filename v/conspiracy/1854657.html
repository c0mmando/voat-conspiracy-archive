            Not every American home had tv sets in the fifties, let alone the 30s. Maybe one in four, and those were folks with homes. They were expensive also, and broke down frequently.

            I have to call bullshit, or at least some confusion in the account....
           </p>
           <p>
            The first UK TV broadcast was at the end of 1936, and even in the 50's TV ownership was only just starting to reach the masses (this was often done on a rental basis by the working class, up until the 70's...and may be the source of the story, mebbe the rental companies bought up old US stock?)
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd imagine there is also some conflation of the effect radio had on the population, as people would have started to get their news from the official government propaganda machine (the BBC as it's known!) around the time of the depression...though even radio sets were a luxury the common man couldn't afford until post war...stories of whole neighbourhoods gathering to listen to radio broadcasts in the home of the one person in the area who could afford one are pretty common in the WW11 era
           </p>
           <p>
            TV and radio weren't used as mindless entertainment for the masses until much later really...probably the 70's was where that really got going, and though it wasn't an overnight thing, it pretty much had the effect you mention

            I just want to say that I feel like there is definitely something bad going down behind the curtain. I've also noticed how insane the entire thing has been. It's so outrageous that it has to have been planned. In the pit of my stomach I've got a ball of dread for what the day will bring in the news each morning when I get up. I've been thinking about how Soros' life goal is to destroy America and how Hilary didn't get in. He's played all his cards and has nothing left to lose now, its all or nothing because he's at the end of his years. Is Obama puppet enough to launch nukes at the US and say it was Russia? That's what I've been thinking for a couple weeks now. And when he "confirmed" it was russian interference it just gave me more chills. Ugh.

            I give you props for being one of the few new users around here to admit freely that there is no conclusive proof about pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your theory makes sense, though I don't think clinton's campaign was doomed from the start, as much as I would have liked that. It wasn't exactly a close race, but there was ton of fraud going on, and I don't think your risk those kinds of crimes if you think you'll lose anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            If PG is a hoax, it might be to meant incite chaos, but I feel its more likely this is about discrediting researchers like us. You know the whole  "fake news" thing? I think that is very tied to pizzagate. "fake news" is meant to discredit any and all news that is not vetted by the elites, and pizzagate is here to finish off all credibility from any single researcher. Most people think "fake news" is all about covering for pizzagate, but I think thats stupid. If we had proof of PG, no amount of media buzzwords would keep the truth from the people, and the MS knows that.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they ever successfully discredit citizen journalism, we have lost this country for good. It will truly be 1984, with the ministry of truth and all.

              The better analogy is "where there's smoke there's probably fire". Pizzagaters need, NEED to lay a specific, actionable charge. I believe its out there, but it may get lost in the witchhunt. Focus on the identities of the children. That's where I'd start, but secrecy can be of great use in an investigation. That's been lost, but it might have been necessary because police and judges can't be trusted. FBI, maybe. Maybe there is a deputized white knight out there.

               I agree.   Right now problem is many of the victims appear to have been killed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Next problem is that too many in law enforcement, FBI, CIA already know about this and do nothing -- THEY ARE IN ON IT.  Not all, of course, but enough that our government is grossly compromised right now.

               Nothing short of a miracle -- and believe you me I am praying for one  -- will create the public outcry at this point which will be necessary to stimulate a call for justice.

                There is hope of finding missing people (but identity can be tightly controlled) or finding non-circumstantial, physical evidence. That is the strongest hope now.

                This has several causes and postulating a conspiracy erodes the case and drives the researcher batty. Authorities
                <em>
                 always
                </em>
                know about crime

                 vaguely
                </em>
                . That's why specifics are needed. It's hard to prosecute a general consensus. I'd avoid this line of reasoning. Even if it's true, it's too painful to keep in mind.

             Just to clarify, the premise is that pizzagate is probably real, but just real enough to damn certain people, not every government in the world. Perhaps Clinton and Podestas connections et all only go so far in that they can take down a few others with them (they won't be cawing names for long if they are extrajudicially executed however).
            </p>
            <p>
             In regards to Fake News, the MSM pushing this is almost unreal, it is just odd that they would just not choose to ignore it. Can they truly believe that their Fake News story is believable, or are they trying to discredit themselves and start afresh? They must know that the illusion of our Western culture is  almost destroyed considering Brexit, EU and refugee crises, and nobody has faith in the elected, surely they would have a back up plan to resume control under the banner of "truth and justice" waved by Trump?

              Ahh, I see. You're describing a "limited hangout."

              One of my favorite bit of espionage terminology!
             </p>
             <p>
              When it comes to the fake news thing, its tricky. There have always been websites and news channels that lie to make money. Obviously "fake news" probably describes the average MSM group better than it does that average blog. What is strange is that they choose now to focus on these sources and claim that they somehow influenced the election more than the entire viewership of the combined MSM? It just doesn't sound legit, and the timing is beyond suspicious.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another likely scenario I forgot to mention: This might just be a big distraction to keep the smart people wasting their time while the real shit goes down. Its not like the pizzagate trail can get any colder than it is now, so I've been splitting my research time between PG and other things.

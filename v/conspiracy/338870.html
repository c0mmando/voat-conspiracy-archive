            A nationwide manhunt for these bases should occur.   Oh, and if people think that this much effort/labor going unnoticed is impossible, consider that Americans didn't even know the bomb was made until they saw the explosion in their local movie theaters (even though many people, compartmentalized of course, worked on the project nation-wide).

             Same goes for the plane that was used to take out Bin Laden, I believe. Those things were around since early 2000's but we're barely learning about their existence.

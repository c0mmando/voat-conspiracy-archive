<p>The game plan from here:

<p>- The \'NSA\' accounts will post useful offgrid posts (see the last 5 days post) then a conversation will start about how helpful and contributing a certain account is and everyone will agree he/it should be the new mod.</p>
<p>- This will effectively give the mod a quick way to delete any potentially undesirable content i may post, no they can\'t just \'delete me\' i won\'t get into the complexities of that now. </p>
<p>- I wasn\'t intending on posting \'free energy\' devices, as I am aware of the structure balance of the frequency of earth, but at a point it will be inevitable to speed up polarization. </p>
<p>- Just take care to the outcomes of your actions, you don\'t want to end up someones pet thing. </p>
<p>- @Atko could make the sub \'system\' this would be a good outcome, and you can take my word, but i respect anyone\'s decision regardless. </p>

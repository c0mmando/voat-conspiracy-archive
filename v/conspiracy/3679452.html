            Let’s talk about statistics. Let’s talk about the concept itself.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_clearance">
             Q-level clearance exists within the Department of Energy.
            </a>
            <strong>
             What
            </strong>
            the fuck does that have to do with anything regarding the court system?
            <strong>
             What
            </strong>
            does that have to do with
            <em>
             anything
            </em>
            Q-LARP has claimed it knows? Look at the number of people who have Q-level clearance. All none of them.
            <strong>
             What’s
            </strong>
            the likelihood that any of them are committing an executable offense by posting on an imageboard? Look at the posts.
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            don’t they say anything? Someone that important–if it actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit. It’s also not going to ask questions that it doesn’t answer. It’s going to explicitly release real data, with citations, directly from a source. The sum total of Q-LARP is an exercise in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdiction">
             postdiction.
            </a>
            Everything it has said is too vague to actually mean anything. It never says anything of any value or specificity. A combination of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">

            does the rest. PEOPLE ARE LOST. THEY ARE BROKEN. THEY FEEL WORTHLESS AND WEAK AND POWERLESS. WHAT BETTER WAY TO PREY ON THEM THAN TO CONTROL THE OPPOSITION?
            <em>
             They won’t question you if you can trick them this way.

            Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews. It’s just that simple. In fact, Q-LARP is entirely owned by jews.
            <strong>
             <em>
              It admits it.
             </em>
            </strong>
            It openly admits to being civic nationalist. It doesn’t support a restoration of the US or Europe to being white-only nations. It doesn’t support deportation of nonwhites. Since the first week, it has called for protection of nonwhites, from the whites who would see them deported/killed. It openly calls for regime change in Iran for the sole purpose of fulfilling the
            <a href="http://smoloko.com/?p=3308">
             Oded Yinon Plan.
            </a>
            Q-LARP has publicly stated it has no intention of removing jews from the West or punishing jews collectively.

           <p>
            <strong>
             What
            </strong>
            purpose is served by leaking the proceedings of nationwide martial law and the arrest of three quarters of the US government…
            <strong>
             <em>
              TWO ENTIRE YEARS
             </em>
            </strong>
            early?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            is that helpful to anyone except the people toward whom it is supposedly directed? Oh, and
            <strong>
             why
            </strong>
            has it taken so long? TWO ENTIRE YEARS of waiting is TWO ENTIRE YEARS to prepare. You realize that even the group that Q-LARP talks about is one of the highest flight risks on earth, right?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would anyone want to give them time to escape?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            does that help us? It doesn’t. It helps THEM. It helps them so much that it hurts us. This is on purpose. Q-LARP exists to create an Orwellian narrative about “the bad people being arrested”, so that when all the good people are arrested they will say that good people are bad people, and the stupid Q-LARPing masses will simply believe it and help commit their own genocide. We’ve already seen this for 70 years.
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            do you think it isn’t continuing?
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would someone ostensibly leaking the proceedings not actually leak any information?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would someone who claims to be on our side not give us a playbook for how to operate during the event?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            isn’t it telling us how to become leaders of our community to calm the terrified millions around us–who will inevitably exist once the media starts reporting on the “Trump coup”, or when they see their favorite media reporters arrested by the military live on air?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            is Q-LARP a civic nationalist?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            does that help America?
            <strong>
             How
            </strong>
            is Trump is magically insulated during what will be painted internationally as a soft coup?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            would the apparatus allow him to engage in this coup to the extent that he would actually be protected?
            <strong>
             Why
            </strong>
            does the coup–by Q-LARP’s own admission–not cover the actual PROBLEMS facing this country? Even if Q-LARP is a real “organization” of a sort, everything it says points to the action as being nothing more than “Part A of the ZOG wants to do something Part B of the ZOG doesn't.”

            If there is something,

             why
            </strong>
            is nothing Q-LARP said would happen happening?

            Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people?

             Where
            </strong>
            are the riots it talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing, and there haven’t been any other riots in the last two years.
            <strong>
             Where’s

            are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign.

            Already touched on this at the end of the first section. So Q-LARP’s going to arrest most of the US government, right? All the bad people going away. And what’s this? It says that WE won’t have to grab our guns and help out? Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved!

             these places would attract feds. I don't know the details. I just know that there's a limit to what can be accomplished online, because the internet encourages the illusion that we're a minority when the Truth is, most White people, given sufficient information, end up somewhere in the same ballpark of ideas.

Jew say women equal so I no put woman in place. There will be no uprising because there can be no organization because there can be no trust.

                I figured that’d be the wrong verbiage to use. What I mean to say is the restoration of the woman’s place in traditional social hierarchy: mother, wife, homemaker, soul of the community. Not voting, not in the workforce, not legally equal to men. Only men can enforce this restoration, which means–in a physical and psychological sense–putting women in their place. Not as a use of hatred or abuse.

                MGTOW is more white genocide propaganda. No, it’s not healthy to engage in the dating or sexual practices foisted on us in modernity by jews. No, it’s not acceptable to put up with modern (again, jewish) legal behaviors regarding relationships. But it’s equally unhealthy to simply run away. Refusal to engage isn’t sufficient, because they win by default. It must be actively combatted, through enforcement of our own hierarchies.

                 So, again I ask, what does the Individual do? Post "Islam is Right About Women" posters?

                 I gave my friend a talking-to one time about how he let his wife walk all over him. Guess that's my good deed for that day.

                  Social shaming. Works wonders for getting women (and men) to do things. Gotta step that up. Always call out degeneracy. It’s never acceptable.

                   I do my best. Same friend asked me to cuck him with his wife and I told him it'd destroy his marriage. Admittedly I sat on it for about a month before saying that cuz I was tempted to get my dick wet.

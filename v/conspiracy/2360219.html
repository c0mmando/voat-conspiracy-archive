<h1>1 Spot goes to Alex Jones.</h1>
<p>I Discovered Alex Jones at about when I got into truth and that was during the pizzagate time frame. Prior to that I had no idea who he was. He was covering the information very well and it lead me to other facts that I was not aware of. My research made me feel sick and I had to dial back my inquires for my own sanity. I noticed a day or two later that the video he did was no longer available. At that time a number of excuses were given to why his show won\'t cover it that seems to contradict the entire purpose of his show. I paid no mind, but continued to watch, waiting for the next slice of truth. Weeks went by with nothing of value mentioned. I was concerned about why his show wasn\'t putting a spotlight on anything new or of value. I started investigating him. I saw that he was one of the major entities to talk about 911 and did good work. But that was it. Sure he did work on FEMA and other topics, but there was a lot missing that he didn\'t touch on. I discovered his net worth, his house and the life he pretends to live. I discovered him changing his story days after a report. Then I noticed he was actually giving wrong information. </p>
<p>I made a ratio calculation in my mind of truth and untruth shared by him. I concluded that in recent years, he has not been as truthful as he was and that it was not safe to listen to him anymore. I believe that his purpose is to disinform us now.</p>
<h1>2 Joe Rogan</h1>
<p>Joe Rogan is pretty simple. I never listened to him in the past, nor will I in the future. He has gone public to tell the people of Earth that he will lie to us for money. That is likely the only thing he has said that is true.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/TryXx-tLCzE?t=1m25s">https://youtu.be/TryXx-tLCzE?t=1m25s</a></p>
<h1>3 David Icke</h1>
<p>I actually really like David Icke. He is as far as I know, one of the most well known spokes people about hidden truths. He has eloquently addressed mass brainwashing which I feel is his strongest suit. But what makes me suspect is of all the things he knows, he never mentions the Talmud, Never mentions the Ashkanazim Jew, and he talks about reptile hybrids. I haven\'t 100% ignored him because he still does some great things, but I am weary and take what he says with a grain of salt now.</p>
<h1>4 Paul Joseph Watson</h1>
<p>I haven\'t listened to much of this guy but he seems like a shill who calls others shills, always calling people idiots like a bought and paid for corporate stooge. A great example of this is his video on Michael Moore. Michael Moore has a net worth of $50 million. His &quot;Truth&quot; movies always allude the truth and as a researcher, only covers the side a well paid corporate disinformation agent would. As far as I\'m aware, Paul has never exposed any truths and is one of the worst actors I have seen who supports the two party fiction in all his diatribe.</p>
<h1>5 Mark Dice</h1>
<p>It pains me to say this as I have in the past found much of his work to be very entertaining.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcgdkW-rQmo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcgdkW-rQmo</a></p>
<p>And although he does speak the truth sometimes, he forgot that presidents are controlled puppets of the United States Corporation in the two party fiction.</p>

            Good list, mate. You have all my respect for being able to figure it out all by yourself. It's unbelievable how many demented sheeple are out there believing these disinfo shills.

             Thanks! If you have anyone to add, let me know and I'll update the list. Also, thank you for saying something. A lot of people say to me, "I know how corrupt Earth is, but what can I do?" I tell them, "Tell your friends. The best thing we can do for each other is raise awareness to change the balance of 99% sleeple, to anything else."
The more of us there are, the more effective we will be in making Earth better.

            Looks like a list of successful pro-nationalist, anti-globalist, anti-leftist individuals who get a lot of play on YouTube. I see no reason to think that  any of them are disinformation agents. That would imply that they don't believe what they are reporting. On the contrary, all of them believe strongly in what they are saying. The tactic of trying to brand an individual as somehow tainted, so that the individual can be dismissed and his words disregarded, is a leftist tactic. We on the nationalist side listen to what people have to say and judge them on their words and actions.

             I haven't chosen a side, leftist or nationalist as I believe they are all social constructs created to divide us.

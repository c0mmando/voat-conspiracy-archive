            I was thinking that. You could say that a story is made up, and a photo audio or video is faked, however it has always been harder to fake video and audio especially if you're using a lookalike of a person to set them up and the lookalike doesn't have the exact same features as the person being set up. It's even harder with audio because you would have to find a person who looks and sounds exactly like the person who you want to set up. You could dub over the audio track of a video with someone who sounds like that person but there's ways to tell if the audio didn't come from the camera the video track was recorded with. But it hasn't been easy, virtually impossible.

            That's exactly how R.Kelly got off, he said the tape was a fake because there were indications that the tape the prosecution were using as evidence had signs it had been copied but I was really surprised, because even if it was a copy it's really hard to fake a video with a lookalike that accurately, especially with only the analog tools at the time. And even if it was a copy where was the original? It must have been copied from a master at some point so where was it? Didn't they search the guy's property to try and find it? Isn't that enough reason to issue a warrent to find the master tape?

            Even so, it's still obvious when something is faked.  Light levels, shadow direction, camera focus, looking at the camera, etc.

             Exactly. CGI isn't perfect and if you're editing with analog tools it's even harder to fake something.

             I dunno. I saw one with Gal Gadot, and while I was aware it was a fake, it looked very, very real. I think it's a good theory that this was released in anticipation of what was on Weiner's laptop, but I doubt it ever sees the light of day.

              So I looked this up, you know for research, and I have to disagree.  There is one point in particular where the actress fixes her hair.  In that moment, her arm moves across her face, and the facial overlay stops, and you can see her real face.   Also, there are many times, when the bottom lines of the chin fail to line up properly.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd say it's still fairly easy to spot a fake, as long as there is a bit of motion to the video.

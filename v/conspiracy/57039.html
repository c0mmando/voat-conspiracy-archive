            And also the down voting, any good CT is critical, if you want it to look real you've got to get with the program....When I question the validity of this site, those post's should get upvoted, not downvoted, here again its just makes the place transparent...I mean think about it, if I'm calling the place out, good CT's would defend that, or atleast upvote the questioning of this place, not downvote, do you see? it ust does'nt make sense

            ya, exactly, I mean like your post and the "breathe" guy....that in itself makes no sense, your tactics don;t go with the genere we have here...shills in new places need to pretend to be "more on my side" than your doing, playing the reddit game here isn;t going to help you corral people here, you really need to be more subversive at first, you know, suck up, pretend....If you come across with the typical shill routine of tryng to belittle people, pass them off as nuts, that kinda thing, you know, with the snarky little statements, it just starts feeling like reddit all over again....I m,ean ofcourse we can then just blame it on "conspirotards" infiltrating in order to disrupt....but then I thought we had this more "intelligent" group here, and that people would step up and out shills, your going WAY to fast for he program....like I said, you need to suck up, pretend to be on my side, like "ya man, this place is run by the feds, I just know it", you know, agree with me, get me on your side, let others join in.....you can let us strat organizing, then you can charge us all as terrorists....I mean come on, get with the program....who scripts this crap? whos your director? Snoddy's got to rewrite this sketch....its not going to get good reviews if you just do the same old thing....show us something new

            well where the post? its gone, removed, I thought we weren't censoring here? why would a post suggesting that voat is run by the same people as reddit be removed? hmm? I mean its not like we couldn't have a rational discussion about it, It also would be nice to discuss the reasoning behind the post being removed, which was why was my text edited? virtually immediately in another post....2 college kids without enough time and funding, as suggested by "them" in other posts could'nt possibly have the tech to "observe" individuals and their posts in real time unless there was assistance involved....the delay in the upload times are suspicious as well.....why don't you just tell it like it is?..."hey, we're the military, we work for ziobankers and they fund us to see what your talking about....I actually think a direct dialouge would be great and really push the membership here through the roof....I mean where elese would the general population get a chance to question "you" people about what your doing and why? I think we have the right to ask you why your selling your fellow countrymen down the river for min wage and becasue someone told you it was your "job"...hiding does nothing, it only buys you a little time...

            wow whoda thunk it....they also make websites that corral ct's....like this place, the "cool" new open place where things like what happens a reddit don;t happen here....as of course this place is jus owned and operated by a couple of college kids....so thers absolutely no possible way that they do things like edit tex in posts or completely remove them,....but gee, somehow, they did....thusly proving this place is bullshit....wheres the link that tells me if I'm shadowbanned?....ha , this place is an eglin/naste production

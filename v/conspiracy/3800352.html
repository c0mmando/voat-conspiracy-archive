<p>China can\'t wage and win a land war with the west. We\'d sink them before they got close to invading. So how else do they do it?</p>
<p>First, infiltrate our universities, media corporations and tech industries. Start pushing Marxist idealogies through the universities and compromising key assets in the system. Key professors, academics, figureheads in various financial, legal and tech institutions/companies such as the WHO, Google, Facebook, the UN and other global institutions. Effectively embedding Chinese influence into the cultural aspect of the west. Result? A huge surge in SJW, feminism and post modernist/marxists. Why would big tech or any other institutions abide by it? Money and access to the chinese market. That\'s access to 1.3B wallets in China.</p>
<p>Next, start pushing their propaganda in our media and entertainment by forcing their censorship on the west by restricting access to the Chinese market. The entertainment industry; being shallow and despicable has no qualms selling out their own to make more money.</p>
<p>Once they have  vice grip on the culture, education and main stream media; attack the economy and strengthen dependence on China. Enslave over 1 million people in concentration camps and ensure you have sufficient forced labor to fill the expected demand for increased production, both in the consumer export industries and the internal military industry. Wonder how China built and deployed a new warship in the last 2 months? Well, with this lovely smokescreen of a pandemic, they had all the distraction they needed.</p>
<p>Next, facilitate the leak of a moderately dangerous virus that will do enough damage to cause panic but not at such velocity to rouse too much suspicion. As the virus spreads, ensure your lapdog; the WHO, cautions border closures and flight restrictions. Meanwhile China restricts internal transport and flights, welds their own people into their homes, builds dozens of new incinerators that appear to be burning 24/7 and disappear anyone who tries to speak out about the virus or the CPPs reaction.</p>
<p>Then as the various countries of the west go into panic mode and issue mandatory lock-downs, they exploit the confusion and panic by distributing dysfunctional ventilators, shoddy test kits and ensuring that they are seen as the world\'s saviors. They start stirring shit by accusing other countries as being the source of the virus while they destroy and obliterate any evidence that may have been present in Wuhan.</p>
<p>There is far too much coincidence in all of this. And I have no idea what will happen next but news from the South China Sea indicates they\'re preparing for a land grab.</p>
<p>Thoughts? Am I crazy? Have I missed anything? Am I connecting dots that aren\'t there? Call me a kike, nigger or whatever but please at least point out why I\'m wrong. Because from where I\'m standing, it looks like we\'re on the downward trajectory, a dim and dark decline of the west.</p>',

             I mean, not really because it was Israel tugging on the leash of the US Govt. No other countries were involved there besides NATO. I think a world war needs to be more encompassing.

            NOT FULLY YET. PLAYER #2 HAS NOT ENERED THE GAME... Introducing 2025 : Hyperborean Wisdom of Nimrod de Rosario and Gnostic Geopolitics
            <a href="http://archive.ph/SKRJE">
             http://archive.ph/SKRJE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who are not understanding the game we are coming to GOG AND MAGOG.  The camps will oppose each other. In USA due to low education and lack of anti jew actors anybody that goes against NWO (Jews taking the world as their God Jehova promised it to them) will most likely be executed by MILretards of the US ARMY or MIKE the local retarded LEO chief, by Matt the semi fat libertarian DHS guy, or by CIA and FBI brainwashed glownigs, by Jews in groups of many, by Israeli troops in Joint Work with "overtired US military".
           </p>
           <p>
            If you believe in Q or G. Neither is accurate but both contain elements. If you raise the bar you land in H, H is for the Hyperborean Gnosis transfered by SS officers to South America and continued by South American MIL intel actors.
           </p>
           <p>
            H :
           </p>
           <p>
            - Ideology is what makes NWO
           </p>
           <p>
            - Ideology is based on Cosmovision (what earth is)
           </p>
           <p>
            - That Vision was given to Jews by Jehova
           </p>
           <p>
            - Elders of Zion, White Brotherhood, Druids, Men in black (Politicians, Bankers, Ceos, Useful Idiots) are the true leaders of the world
           </p>
           <p>
            - The opposition is US OR THE FORCES OF THE SPIRIT
           </p>
           <p>
            - Jews are the "Heart of the Earth" also known as Anahata Chakra
           </p>
           <p>
            - Jews guided or tricked by the Idealogists (Rabbis, Elders, Zionists) are enforce behind their idea of taking and controlling the world from Jerusalem
           </p>
           <p>
            - Rotschild is not necessarely important, he is matter fact low level compared to the magicians at the top
           </p>
           <p>
            - Nimrod wrote a letter. It is available for print on Scribd.com, all is explained
           </p>
           <p>
            - Bogd Buddha, a non Synarchic Buddha has prophesized the time and 2025 to 2028 was the date
           </p>
           <p>
            - Trump the last president? Remember when "Meme Magik" took off and the book predicting Trump as last president was going around
           </p>
           <p>
            - There will be a time that you must realize that this world is not ours nor yours
           </p>
           <p>
            - That we do not belong here
           </p>
           <p>
            - That if the Gnostic logic is followed the Archons control it and Satan is at its head
           </p>
           <p>
            - If the realization comes, you will have to face the beast. It will come during your sleep and will try to lock you up.
           </p>
           <p>
            - The fight will be lonely but at some point you must stop the fear of death. When you die, you will need knowledge to direct yourself to the right path or you can destroy yourself and return to ignorance again and again.
           </p>
           <p>
            - Recommend you read the Mystery of Bellicena Villca, The Secret Story of The Thulegesselshaft, The Letter to the Chosen Ones by Nimrod De Rosario, Beasts Men &amp; Gods by Ossendowski, anything about Shamballah versus the Lords of Agharta, Red Shamballah, Forbidden Religiin by Jose Herrou Arragan, about the Cathars and how Jews destroyed them, Vickings and the Valhalla
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck. We always try to tell some of you but it has become clear that many are not ready to understand or listen.   You are fighting what we call World Synarchy or Synarchic forces (Material) and youare obviously part of the Aghartean Forces (Spiritual &amp; Ancestral).
           </p>
           <p>
            It all begins with ONE PIECE OF GNOSIS.... AFTER that darkness is clear form.

            Every public owned companies majority stock owner is blackrock or vangaurd, both owned by kikes. Everything you said is shit jews have been doing since the cold war. You are crazy for blaming China (they are not an ally obvious but they are not owned by kikes) but everything you said is true with kikes.

             Have you any data to back up that assertion? I know jews are high up in a lot of businesses and fields, I don't doubt it. But it seems to be a result of culling the weak jews during WW2, the majority of jews who could escape were the smart, wealthy and connected and the ones who got slaughtered are those were too weak, poor or with no political or industry connections.
            </p>
            <p>
             The result is an entire generation of people with something to prove and an "us against the world" mentality, and so you end up seeing them reach positions of success. It seems circumstantial rather than like some overarching conspiracy.

             China however, that's clear as fucking day. The CPP and their activities are obvious, they don't hide their collusions with Chinese and international businesses. Everyone knows China has symbolic stakes in thousands of western companies and through that they exert control.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think I'm crazy and I think this makes more sense than some global jewish conspiracy.

              At the top, it is an overarching conspiracy. China is indeed a huge problem, but where did communism come from? The earliest source for the idea of world control is the old testament. Read "The Controversy of Zion" by Douglas Reed, written 1956 I think, which proves that communism and zionism were twin movements launched simultaneously for the same end goal, while appearing to be contradictory in nature.

               Interesting, you're right, I hadn't considered what lead the Chinese to communism nor have I explored the origins of it. So ignorance on my part, but thanks for the reference and context. I'll check it out.

              Jews just pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and become 40% of billionaires from nothing post ww2? And before you IQ cope, based on the number of whites vs jews and how the bell curve works there are 10x as many high IQ whites as jews because there are a 100x more whites. It is retarded to think it is anything other than a conspiracy.

               No I don't think they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, there were successful/rich/powerful jews who escaped is my point. They were already in the hotseat at that point, they didn't just become billionaires after WW2. High IQ doesn't mean you go into banking or finance either. One of Hitler's motivations for going after the Jews was that they were already in control of too many financial and media institutions. He saw them as the scapegoat for all of Germanys post WW1 woes and used that to rally the German people behind the NAZI party.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Federal Reserve was created in the early 1910s, which is around the same time Hitler started working towards his end goals. Hence my point that the Jews were already rooted in many of the financial and legal institutions at that point.

I believe there were a peoples exiled fueled by a sink/swim mentality, a peoples who value education and personal success and a peoples with connections and means. Why do you think they go into law, medicine, accounting, banking etc? They are not the career choices of the unmotivated and lazy.

                  Can you prove any other group (except black ill grant you that) do it at the same levels? Why haven't faggots/trans/japs taken over any industries like jews have? The only other group that semi has a little bit in Chinese because they fucking study the kikes.

                    It is a lot more complex than that, basic rundown is jews are stealing our tech to give to chinese to try to break into their markets. Xi is a nationalist, they want him dead and jews have a strong globalist faction there.

             I believe that quote is from Einstein, but regardless I'm not interested in platitudes. I don't think WW3 is going to be fought like any war we know, I think it's being fought against a sleeping enemy: the west. We're going into the long night with our eyes blinded by baubles, the west has become so complacent and we've forgot that we need to fight to keep our place in the world.

             This is evident given how much rot has taken hold on our culture: literature, music, film and art has become idealogical, mass produced buillshit. The ability for an individual to make rational decisions and healthy life choices has been supplanted by algorithms designed to make us consume more, read less, think less and obey more.

             I work in a certain big tech company, one of the largest advertising and media companies in the world. I'm not anyone important but I am close to the heart of the machine and I'm biding my time. I sit close to the beast so I can learn it's workings and leverage that to protect my family. In practice this has meant that I am disconnected from the world and society; I have no friends, no extended family and no connection to society because I refuse to play the part mandated for me by manufactured leaderships.

               How about you make an argument instead of putting the burden on me to construct your argument by reading a book. I am making observations of known truths: China is exerting it's censorship internationally, China is ensuring the world builds further dependence on Chinese production, China has stated the want to surplant the USA as the leading cultural and economic powerhouse over the next century. China has continuously pushed their borders in the South China Sea. China has been making sweeping purchases of businesses, land and lobbyists in foreign countries.
              </p>
              <p>
               Telling someone to "read a book" isn't a valid counter-argument, it's intellectually dishonest and an attempt to negate an argument by asserting ignorance on behalf of your interlocutor.

            This sounds a lot like that "Communist Plans to Take Over America" list that was written by that Skosen guy and read into the congressional record in the 1950s.  Alot of it applies and seems to have been already implemented.

             I have no idea what you're talking about, I'll have to look into it. But I know I can't be the only one to see this, but its too horrible and terrifying for me to look away. I fear for my son's future. I don't care about anything else, I just want him to be safe and happy. And I look out at the world and I can't help but think his future will be filled with famine, struggle and war. I feel like I've planted a seed in blood soaked soil and it's only future is that of pain and suffering.

             This is something I've been trying to understand for a long time. If its people with the most money? Then Gates, Rothschild, Buffet etc...In the middle east, we have the Saudi King, in the East we have Xi Jinping and in the west we have the liberal elite (majority of the EU, Democrats, Socialist parties) and then the banks, pharmaceutical and financial institutions etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think there is a single group, I think there is multiple groups at the "top" in a constant tug-of-war with each other. It seems that way to me because it's like that all the way down the global hierarchy. Rival groups, companies, institutions, even down the pleb level: social cliques. I think its clear from things like the Bilderberg meetings that there is no single group or entity in control. It's more like the Mexican cartels; multiple groups in a delicate equilibrium where they can only really work by conspiring together toward common goals. It's also inherent in our species; to work together to a common end.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that also means there are hundreds of thousands of puppet masters. The cast of the elaborate show is probably bigger than you or I could really fathom.

            Everytime someone doesn't like someone they say he's the anti-christ.  Everyone was making stories of Obama being the anti-christ.  It's all bullshit.  Now you're saying Trump is going to bring about the anti-christ by just saying that he recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Do you get how dumb this sounds?
           </p>
           <p>
            How do you think this anti-christ is going to get all of use to be slaves?  Is anti-christ bullet proof?  Jesus wasn't nail proof.  Hell I support a third temple being built just to prove everyone wrong that no anti-christ will appear.  If it's that fucking easy WHY DON'T THEY JUST BUILD IT?  LOL  The entire story is ridiculous.

            This behavior is evident currently the way they gang-stalk and pull the strings on goyim.  This is why their a liability to every community they inhabit.  They're taught by their goddamned religious authorities to subjugate goys, and all of them do it.  They're taught this is something that even benefits goyim, even though it's clearly unethical, and it implicates Jews in criminal conspiracy against all non-Jews.  Non-Jews would be fully justified in preventing this by any means necessary.

            The Jewish peoples math is wrong ... I know
            <em>
             Gasp
            </em>
            !
The Third Temple has been built and was the one standing when Jesus was crucified, The Messiah arrived at the time of the third Temple !
           </p>
           <h1>
            1) The tabernacle (in the wilderness) mobile temple #2) Solomon's Temple #3) One Built after Babylon
           </h1>
           <p>
            This so called "Third Temple" will not be holy, why do I say this you probably ask? Judaism was replaced with Christianity on/before the day of Pentecost when the Christians were infused/ baptized in the holy spirit, and soon enough history may repeat. Do you really believe the Two witnesses, Two olive trees are two people who would be easy for MSM to ignore ?

             I know Christianity is polluted, Christmas is a pagan holiday, Jews wrote all Christmas songs including Rudolph the Red-Nosed reindeer, I could go on for days, I used to be an atheist! A lot of things have brought me to God and eventually to Jesus. I feel the story of Jesus has been manipulated for sure, but I get the idea it was their only choice, even after death he would not go away! Hijacking his story was the only way to steer everyone! Even in modern times they are trying to erase Jesus Christ. Ask your Amazon echo, who Jesus Christ is? It will tell you I don't know, then ask it about Buddha, the Prophet Muhammad, and any other religious figure and it will give you a full description, but not Jesus Christ, I can clearly see when things are being hidden from me, it makes me ask why?

              They "fabricated" the story that Jesus was never raised but his body was stolen by his apostles, since then they have fabricated more lies and inserted them into mainstream Christianity.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for Christmas think of it this way, what do the Jews (Note: i use this in a religious context not race context) love more than God, ever thought of the real reason Jesus overturned the tables. Christmas is just a way to separate the money from the goyim, do you see the similarities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Idol worship, worshiping a roman torturing device (does that make sense) modeled after a pagan ankh. Idols of Christ on a cross, virgin Mary (google: queen of heaven), saints who with a little research might not be "saintly".
             </p>
             <p>
              Making God a composite of three equal parts (think: Illuminati pyramid, Google: Pagan roots of trinity), even tho the bible states "there is no one like me", and tells us clearly who Jesus is.
             </p>
             <p>
              I could go on ! But if you can research both those points, and after confirming throw out that false doctrine you will be closer to the true Christian path.

                They are waiting for their "Messiah" not the one given and prophesied to arrive, and promised to Abraham "thru your seed all nations shall be blessed". This itself conflict with the Jewish tormud (not inspired scripture-more closer to the quran then the bible). I truly believe their messiah will later be shown as the Antichrist.

            One Mans opinion, 1. It has been proven the location of the Dome of the rock, is Not the old site of the Temple Mount. 2. The Antichrist is not a person but a title, like Cesar anyone could and have been the Antichrist. 3. The Bible and the Torah and any other book of religion where all man written bullshit by the cabal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now before you start screaming, lets look a what religion is or has done for you. 1. Nothing, religion is like a fortune teller if u believe strongly enough you will find away to make what ever it is manifest there for it's true.
           </p>
           <p>
            2.Jesus is not coming to save us no one is and this is our biggest weakens, because the cabal have always known this. The greatest trick in history played on us, waiting to be saved why they in so many words raped us.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.If we didn't get out of our religion haze and start fighting for our selfs nothing will change, OUR HISTORY is a LIE....PERIOD.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not expect you to believe me, but if I'm right then they have been mind Fucking us for along time now and religion in the end will be our down fall not our saver.

             I know where you're at, I was there once too. Believe it or not I once was an atheist. My studies into evil people and their way of worship have made me question atheism, as well as I am very big into science, this is almost unbelievable to you, I am sure. Back to evil people. The most elite evil people spend their weekends worshipping spirits while wearing dark robes. It's hard to imagine with all the money power and knowledge accumulated over time, since they have all the secrets of mankind from being in power for so long, that they would waste their precious short life's at events to worship when they clearly know it's all bullshit! Think about it the things they do require a lot of money and are very risky of being found out. But they do them anyway for some reason, I assume they really believe it! Seeing their intense belief in evil and the lengths they will go to worship it, has made me rethink atheism! Yes the Bible is full of bullshit, somewhere in the middle of all religion is a shred of Truth. I find Great Lengths have been taking to Discount the existence of Jesus Christ. More than the head figure of any other religion. Ask your Amazon Echo who Jesus Christ is. It's funny how it doesn't know. I'll never convince you but keep looking maybe you will see the light. Good luck.

              First thank you for your comments, now i very miuch believe in God(know as source  through out the universe) And Jesus. Just not the man made religions or books that followed. If any true info in text form exists, the Vatican is STILL holding it hostage.

               My studies in evil have shown me, there is a belief they must tell you what they're doing in order to have good fortune. I know it sounds crazy ,  but it appears to be true . The truth is out there, I can almost guarantee it! I have a lot of theories, but science and probability lead me to believe in a creator. All the elements of a gold Rolex watch are found in the Sahara Desert, if I were to find a completed watch laying in the sand it would be easy to assume it was created naturally, here's where probability comes in, what are the chances thet all the separate elements would join together in such a way without manipulation to produce a Rolex watch. Probabilities extremely low just about non-existent. The universe is way more complicated than a Rolex watch, how can I assume it put itself together? Just cuz I can't build it doesn't mean it wasn't built. I don't appreciate all comments but yours have been good, Thanks For The civil discussion. Hard to come by these days.

                I can guarantee if you start worshiping the devil and drinking blood that you will not become all powerful.  And those people you mentioned might do it but it is not the cause of them being in positions of power.  It's their willingness to not to care what happens to other people which affords them the opportunities other caring people will not take.  Like bombing a country to take their oil and lying to everyone about it to fill their bank accounts.  Most people won't do that.  You have to be willing to not give a shit.  And they worship "not giving a shit".  It's like the
                <s>
                 r
                </s>
                eddit shit "No Fucks Given".  They worship that mentality.  It's what satanism is all about.  So it's not Satan giving them power.  It's their brains not having compassion and a conscience that allows them to profit off of bad things.

<p>If you read it you will see that it is talking about feedback from various inputs and they show it as an electrical system but it is pushed on the real world. That is what I meant about system exploitation. These documents are all you really need to know to break the entire system of the world and murder the world. ... simple as that. I am not a really smart guy. I do well in the world by just not following the crowd but I do not have some brilliant intellect. So this stuff is kinda over my head. had I dug it when I was a young man I would have understood it better but thats not the case. My point is that it is shockingly easy to destroy an entire planet with billions of people by interacting with their national and international support systems in a way that causes them to fail... Then everyone dies. That is where we are at today, at the \'everyone dies\' stage. 
Ok, one more for ya. The above are the real deal no questions asked. This next one is... well... God knows if it is real or not. I have read it all and it sure FEELS REAL based on the above information.
This paragraph in particular: From SWQW</p>
<p><em>Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint, there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system. 1. Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which will only result in a total destruction of the living earth. 2. Take control of the world by the use of economic &quot;silent weapons&quot; in a form of &quot;quiet warfare&quot; and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide. The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth. They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable to them</em></p>
<p>Read SWQW and then this last thing and refer back to it and see if it seems like the same fuckers working on it. It sure does to me but who knows. </p>

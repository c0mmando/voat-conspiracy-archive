            Fucking Washington Post. Talk about 'fake news'.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best they can do is a deleted section written by the columnist of a very liberally-biased publication say that Trump said it to an anonymous source he personally knows. "Oh yeah, he did say it guys. Trust me, I'm definitely not making it up or embellishing it."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is such bullshit. How does this possibly pass for journalism, and how do they have the cojones to lambast "fake news"?!
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is...
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Don't think of a pink elephant.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Chances are, you just did. In the same way, even if it's so obviously bullshit, if they keep exposing people to this "Trump is a creep" message, it will influence perceptions of him. Mud sticks, even if it is thrown at you.

            I'm pretty sure he said it, but not when his daughter was 13. He said something to that effect when she was an adult.

             This is something quite different. In this video, he said he might be dating Ivanka if she weren't his daughter. He's basically saying he likes, admires and respects his daughter and thinks she is beautiful. What a monster.
            </p>
            <p>
             OP's article is saying that Trump said he is sexually attracted to his daughter. Which he almost certainly did not say.

            All of these articles come from liberal news sources, and none of them link to any definitive proof.

            It bothers me that this kind of sensationalist bullshit is coming out of my political party... I'd rather not be associated with people who will just fucking lie and make things up because they are having a social temper tantrum.

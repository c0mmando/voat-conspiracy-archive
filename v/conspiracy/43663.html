            We work quite hard to uphold the ethos of free flowing information that defines the sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I am quite worried about this attempt top unseat the mod team here; as the way in which this sub is ran currently involves zero content moderation. It is truly the definition of a user curated space. Why would you wish to facilitate a new mod team which may threaten that?

              r/conspiracy
             </a>
             , which is kind of the point isn't it. As you are a moderator of 18 subs, most of which involve the discussion of conspiracy, you control a huge amount of access to information and informative discussion. As a site which in recent weeks has come under fire on multiple occasions for censorship and the deletion of critical posts, I think it's only natural for people, especially on a conspiracy forum, to question those that hold authority over them and their posts. So I've started this discussion to see if anyone else agrees that with a new site, new moderators should be chosen as part of the move away from reddit. I think the accusation of an attempted unseating is grossly misrepresenting what's going on here, we are trying to discuss the best course moving forward on this site and the discussion as you can see from the comments is very much open. I'm curious as to why it would be such a problem for you to step down as a moderator? You have 18 subs that you moderate on reddit, why the sudden concern for this place after months of inactivity?

              Reddit has no doubt had a censorship problem for a very long time. And I do everything in my power to fight that censorship. For example, we constantly sticky posts in
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              which expose censorship from around reddit, including the post which is currently stickied.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               you control a huge amount of access to information and informative discussion.

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              If you were a bit more familiar with reddit, you would be aware that the moderator positions I hold are precisely because of my ardent defense of the free flow of information. There are numerous groups within the reddit meta who attempt to control huge amounts of subreddits in order to manipulate opinion and censor information, I am one of the few who actively opposes those type of groups and there are many long time users from
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              who can vouch for me in this regard.

              I visit voat at least once a day to keep an eye on this sub.
             </p>
             <p>
              I actually outlined the reason I am concerned about changing up the mod team in a different post.
             </p>
             <p>
              Because there is currently no log of moderator actions on voat, it is imperative that the mod team consist of users who are known for upholding the ethos of free speech and organically curated content which is constantly under attack on reddit. This is because there is currently no way for moderators on voat, on any subreddit, to keep track of the actions of other moderators. To that end, if
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
               /v/conspiracy
              </a>
              is going to continue to be a forum wherein user voting and submission determine the content which is posted then having a mod team who can be trusted to uphold that ethos is essential.
             </p>
             <p>
              By removing the current team and starting fresh, there is a huge possibility that a user with devious intentions would be able to get on the mod list and manipulate this forum sans any oversight from heir fellow mods.

               Your underlying concern is completely understandable, without transparency this sub could be manipulated by a user with devious intentions. But that concern for transparency could be turned into a great feature of this site, there could be a complete log of all moderator actions for each sub so that the users can guard the guards and any questionable actions can be discussed in an open manner. I honestly can't tell if you're being disingenuous but prior to today (according to others who have posted on here) the only moderator who has been active on this sub in the past 3 months is PrivateJoker, so despite you saying you keep an eye on things every day, you have not actively contributed in 3 months, not even a post and although this may sound ironic coming from a day old user I think you should have had a more active role on here to truly be considered a moderator.
              </p>
              <p>
               But my main concern is the fact that you are a reddit moderator for
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                r/conspiracy
               </a>
               which many consider to be full of shills, paid posters and covert manipulation. So even if you are a truly honest person who can be vouched for by other reddit users, you've been tarred with the same brush as reddit itself and therefore, at least in my eyes, cannot fully be trusted. This site in meant to be a fresh start and so in this case it seems prudent to throw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are totally right about moderator transparency though, I can't emphasis enough how right you are about that and I'll be suggesting something to that effect in the voat discussion sub.

            The only two mods I don't know out of that group are Peglius and PrivateJoker, all the others have shown themselves to be upstanding people, even if I don't 100% agree with all their views or politics.

            Why is someone with an account on Reddit with zero posts in this sub attempting to overthrow the mods?

             I moved over here 12 hours ago after seeing a post on reddit about this site, I think there are a lot of people who will only have been on here for a day or two, it seems to be the beginning of a mass reddit exodus. No attempt at a coup d'etat, I'm not even saying that I should be a moderator on here but I think it would be a good move to have this sub free from ties to old moderators, people who are wrapped up in the website that we are all moving from. I don't really appreciate being sworn at for raising an obviously important issue, judging by the response I've got so far on this post. Keep calm, be cool and if you want to engage in an intelligent debate about the issue without resorting to profanity then I'm all ears.

              So you just came here, and even though you've never once participated in
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              on your account on Reddit, you felt the need out of all the subs on voat, you just had to get rid of the evil old mods from Reddit here?
             </p>
             <p>
              Sure smacks of an agenda if you ask me.
             </p>
             <p>
              Axol and Assuredly both have been mods of
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
               /r/conspiracy
              </a>
              for no more than about a year, so to claim that they are some sort of Reddit moderator old guard is a laughable and disingenuous straw man.
             </p>
             <p>
              So again, I ask, who are you and why are you here attempting a coup de eta of one of the only decent subs on Reddit, one of the only subs I even bother going to on what will eventually be the next Reddit?
             </p>
             <p>
              You don't have to answer that question, it's rhetorical, I know exactly what you are doing.

               I have indeed participated on
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                r/conspiracy
               </a>
               , under my reddit handle, when I came to this site I realised since it has a much smaller user base I could pick the name I originally wanted for reddit but was already taken on that site. So now, I am reborn as The_Oracle. I claim no knowledge of the history of
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                r/conspiracy
               </a>
               , all the moderators on there could be perfectly nice chaps but since they are linked to the site which we all seem to agree is failing at best and corrupt to it's core at worst, the idea of simply moving that sub over here, moderators and all, is laughable frankly, the whole purpose of people moving to this site was a fresh start so why would we have the old moderators? Again, not attempting to stage a coup d'etat (check your spelling on that, you've made the same mistake twice even though I corrected it in my reply), I think if you read the comments on this post most people seem to want a clean slate, I'm wondering why you don't want the same and are so vehemently defending the moderators from
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">

                .  I've been on Reddit for 3 years have over 150k link karma and 10k comment karma, 99% of which, and 99% of all my posting has come from and been to

               <p>
                &gt;I want to remove the mods from the one sub on Reddit that has consistently exposed the corruption on Reddit, particularly AssuredlyAThrowAway who himself was a whistleblower on the corruption who came to

                 /r/conspiracy

                because it was the only place on Reddit where the information could be aired without it being shut down

                That sums you up nicely.

                 Yes, as I said at the very beginning of my second reply, I chose a different handle on this site to my reddit one, because on reddit the handle I originally wanted (The_Oracle) was already taken, but since this place is new I could choose that handle. I wrote this all in my previous post, read it again slowly. I'm happy for you, you have achieved much in life it seems. But again, all this doesn't take away from the fact that a debate about choosing the people who moderate our posts is a reasonable course of action, after all the censorship that seems to be going on at reddit I think it's only natural to question who guards the guards, as it were. It is interesting that you seem to be trying to misrepresent me by writing and quoting a fake post as if it were me who had written that. It was you who accused me of making a straw man argument, I suggest you practice what you preach and don't succumb to hypocrisy. And again, what's with the defence of the old moderators? As a veteran
                 <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                  r/conspiracy
                 </a>
                 user of over 3 years and 150k link karma I'm surprised you weren't chosen to be a moderator yourself.

                  I've been asked but I declined because I'm too polarizing and  have little patience for ill informed ner-do-well's such as yourself.  Why don't you go ahead and share your Reddit account name so we can all publicly verify that you are a regular participant there as you claim to be.

                   It might also be because you seem to have to edit every post you make. Absolutely not, I am definitely not going to open myself up to abuse on there by you as well thank you very much. You can question my motives, as you well should with everyone who has something to say in this world, but that does not take away from the validity of having this discussion. But please, continue your ad-hominem attacks, call me an "ill informed ner-do-well." I think your method of discussion speaks for itself really.

                    Open yourself up to harassment?  I've never once harassed anyone on Reddit I have better things to do with my life.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You're damn right I question your motives, even more now that you won't provide what account you post to
                    <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                     /r/conspiracy
                    </a>
                    to.  Until you do I'm going to default from the position that you are a liar, and a fraud - and you don't actually have any post history in
                    <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                     /r/conspiracy
                    </a>
                    , but are instead some interested party trying to worm your way or your friends ways into controlling this sub.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You started the ad-homs, child, when you accused some of the only good mods on reddit I've ever known of being motivated censors.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also 95% of my edits are grammar, and stupid shit, but make whatever chaff you need to up to dissemble now that you've been outed.

                     Question away, again that doesn't diminish the point of this discussion, to rationally choose the path moving forward for this new sub we've all found ourselves on. You accuse me of a straw man argument, then proceed to completely fabricate a post to quote and then attack. You repeatedly use ad hominem attacks and then accuse me of the same for raising legitimate questions about moderators who are entrenched in an old system which we know heavily censors and manipulates discourse. You've even dedicated a new post to me which is flattering but accusing me of infanticide seems a bit much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You've clearly invested a lot of time and effort into
                     <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                      r/conspiracy
                     </a>
                     and so feel the need to defend it, I can understand that but to react so venomously to any sort of rational discourse about a new way of doing things makes me a little sad for you if I'm honest. Just relax, talk rationally about moderator transparency and what could be done to make this place even better than
                     <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                      r/conspiracy
                     </a>
                     . The point of this place is that it isn't reddit, why would we hang on to any vestiges of an old system that we know is breaking, if not already broken?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And you can continue to call me any name under the sun you wish, just don't be a hypocrite.

                       Out of my entire reply, that's what you choose to pick up on? Not the need for discussion about moderator transparency, but that? I claim that reddit is compromised, as anyone who has moved over here also seems to think, and therefore the moderators of major subs over there who also moderate the counterpart subs here should be examined with a wary eye. Is that idea really that controversial?

                         I think you have a far looser definition of evidence than I. Interestingly, I've just checked out your reddit profile, you are a moderator on there yourself of multiple conspiracy related subs including all Alex Jones related ones. Hasn't he on numerous occasions been accused of being a gatekeeper? It's actually pretty hilarious that you moderate the reddit of a suspected shill and then accuse me of nefarious intentions.

                               Absolutely not, if you had come about this in a different way we would be having a much different conversation right now and even dare I say we would be allies, but I don't acquiesce to the requests of straw man creating, ad hominem attacking people. You created this with your bad attitude, I don't need your public retraction or apology.

                                 Again with the name calling, seriously counter productive to discussion. As you can see with my replies to Assuredly, I'm not trying to subvert the board, I'm looking for a new place to discuss conspiracies which is mired in the controversy of reddit and it's known censorship. This is a place of free discussion and ideas, I raised an idea, people discussed it and the need for complete moderator transparency was put forward as a solution to my concerns. Not by attacking me, or accusing me or trying to stage a coup d'etat, but by actually engaging in reasonable discourse. That was the whole point of my post, to find a solution to the problem I perceived.

                                   The removal of the moderators was the only solution I could see at the time for my concerns, after discussion total moderator transparency seems like a massive move in the right direction and I like your idea of a peer reviewed system for seeing what has been removed, with maybe voting to see if a sub agrees with a decision and to have real democracy in this place. I am a regular user of

                                   , nowhere near your level but my biggest achievement on there was posting a link which had over 100 upvotes, small fry I know but I was proud. I'm still not going to give you my name, purely out of principle that I really don't like the way you went about this, swearing at me with your very first post and accusing me immediately. You can choose to believe whatever you like about me, I'm going to bed, for real this time.

            It reminds me of that Eagles song, "Peaceful easy feeling" ....actually no it doesn't, it's really the opposite of that, yes that's what it is....an unpeacful uneasy feeling...

            "ya hi, we're reddit, we're going to give away all our code that we worked so hard to make, ofcourse, right when we get bought out by a huge company, that way, all our "users" can help us make the site better".....
           </p>
           <p>
            we would never pre-emptivley, with malice, do this with the foreknowledge, that by running a site backed by the military "intellegence" community" that eventually "they" that being the usuers, would find out, thus creating a need to be able to "fake our own deaths" and burn Reddit down eventually and be able to start a new site with a new group of smart college kids using the exact same code....because of course allllllll those years ago reddit was nice enough to CPAL the code....a golly, as long as they get their acrediation, their happy"....
           </p>
           <p>
            nah' they'd never do that....that'd be like throwing a lit match into the stove knowing that your pal Muggsy is in there.

            I literally decided to check this out just a few seconds ago and when I saw AssuredlyAThrowAway as a mod I facepalmed hard.  I agree, there should be a clean slate of mods in here, none from the already existing subreddit.

            I am for all new moderators for conspiracy.  The biggest struggle for this site early will be ensuring multiverses do not fall into the wrong hands.  We cannot allow the same crony-fest to happen over here as happened at reddit.

            I asked a site admin about this and he told me that nearly EVERY mod listed has been inactive for 30 days...therefore, though their name is listed, they are NOT mods anymore. In any case,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/axolotl__peyotl">
             /u/axolotl__peyotl

            is the only one that I trust.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that they are looking for mods currently for this SR.

            That is interesting, I don't doubt they had good intentions, I just view with suspicion anyone who had/has mod power at reddit. As the saying goes, if you try to change the system from within, the system will change you. Maybe they've been changed by being within the reddit system, of course they may not have but it would be better to start afresh don't you think?

             so basically they could take a guy named PJ who is really an anon entiety, and then call him Bob, have him use some diferent words and grammar, annnnnd then we'd never know...
            </p>
            <p>
             It;s the story behind the stories we need to question....anyone could make up any shit to go with any story they wanted to....fake id's and realities can be created on the web pre-emptivley in order to "establish" realness....
            </p>
            <p>
             Is lop in the hauge? run by "Mark Z" or is his name really Steve?....Is trinity a really cool dude? or is he a ranking intelligence officer that works with ATT/Tavistock in order to spy on you? Is Bipoloar bear a Mod, or is he Taylor Lawrence? an officer out of Eglin? Is Sgt. Snoddy really black, or is that just shoe polish?and finally...
            </p>
            <p>
             Are the people that run this who they say they are, where they are, with the motives that they tell us?
            </p>
            <p>
             As I have said, if they allow me to use the site as a launching point, well then, that speaks for itself....for the time being....if not, well that says all I need to know...

             That would be great, no offence to private joker but I think it should be a completely fresh start, wipe the slate clean with new mods and make this the premier online destination for conspiracy discussion.

            Okay well how do we go about changing it? I know there's a post somewhere that mods who are inactive for 30 days can be changed, so where do we start this process so that this doesn't become just another place for us "conspiracy theorists" to be censored and controlled?

            Edit: Please upvote this topic so it gets to the front page of

            </a>
            and we can start the discussion about fixing it.

            I can't say I'm thrilled that this is the case, but I feel like with this new site, we can be way better than
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            . There were a lot of people who came to mock or troll people who actually believed and I also noticed an extremely large amount of links that were clearly satire being taken as fact. I think a new start will do us all some good.

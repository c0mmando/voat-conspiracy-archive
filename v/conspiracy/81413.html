            This is a first. In the past 50 years, the right wing has been accused of many things. Hacking has never been one of them.

            This is why I am not a huge fan of Alex Jones... he caused this. He's only better than Glen Beck, who also causes quite a few people to foam at the mouth, in that he actually breaks a lot of pertinent information. I think he's realized it though, the newer co-hosts I've seen are much more calm and professional.

            The problem is, what if someone had acted on that list? I guarantee that not only would decent service men, that wouldn't turn on Americans, would have been hurt but then the government would have the exact excuse it needs to crack down even further. We don't have superior weaponry and it's uncertain if we even have superior numbers... if civil war broke out between the government and true patriots, it would be a war of strategy, not force (from the side of the patriots.)

             Sounds more like a steamy pile of dog shit to me. If someone had the capability to releae these addresses for the purpose of inciting people to go kill these old fucks, why wouldnt they do it themselves? Why would they say jesus is lord and that the public is in charge? Neither of those things are true in the slightest and it sounds to me like something a team of old people would come up with to imitate some "crazy conspircy theorist" so to speak. It just sounds like bullshit to me so i aint buying it. Cant trust shit from the media anymore no matter the source nothing is safe anymore

              Killing them isn't the answer.  While I agree with releasing more information, a public trial of one of these Satanists will show that we have regained control.  I hate what they have done to us, to our future generations.  The long lasting change won't come from a gun, it will come when a bright light is shined upon then and enough people can see exactly what they are.

               2 different ways to achieve the same affect. If they're dead they wont be doing it anymore. Put them on trial they will flee the fucking planet bud. Or close to it. They have enough money to jumblefuck the court in paperwork and stall the trial until they die of old age. The way i see it, kill those fuckers and hang them from the st louis arch.

                I get your frustration, but as for that mentality, you can count me out.  That is still a remnant of the old mentality.  All we need to do is educate ourselves and out breed them.  They will always be witheringly away.  Weather it is in a cell on this planet or a cold dark room on the moon.

                 The CMM makes it hard to educate ourselves or anyone else. People have been eating up the misleading and sometimes complete bullshit news storys to the point where now everything is a fucking hivemind and if you dare question it people treat you like a child. It sucks but if we are going to make the immediate change we need, itll have to be swift and decisive. America's facade is slowly falling apart and people are starting to see whats really happening here but itll be too late before anything can be done. Obama cant milk the war on terrorism for any more money so now were moving on to fucking with russia. Putin has balls. He'll fight us he doesnt give a fuck. Thats why he hasnt backed down in reclaiming Crimea.
                </p>

                 God help us all because we are fucked in about 8 different directions.

              I was referring to the people downvoting this thread, and any others that have anything critical of Trump to say. Also the lack of quality debates on voat, wich I prefer to get my information from, rather than news articles that are more or less biased.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let me be the first to disagree, Trump is proposing some really extreme measures, as did Hitler. Wether Trump is going to orchestrate false flags, and annex countries that once were a part of the old empire, while rounding up and executing democrats, we will see. Let me also agree with you, people here dont realize that before Hitler was able to start a war he made Germany great again. He established his dictatorship in 1934 and for years made great gains in rebuilding the economy and the country, wich bought him much support from the public. It was only when the nazis invaded poland in 1939 Britian and France declared war on Germany, and as far as we know they might have won had they not declared war on the soviet union in 1941, wich began to turn things around.
             </p>
             <p>
              Either way, as a Canadian, I'm not looking forward to him fucking our exports, and I'm not looking forward to border crossings anal probing me every time I wish to visit the states, and given how he wants Mexico to pay for their wall I dont want to hear about a fucking Canadian wall. Obama got along fine with our leaders, both Harper and Trudeau, Obama didnt walk all over us and expect us to apologise like some US leaders like to, I can only hope that Trump will at least try have good relations with Canada, regardless of who our leader is, or how much it benefits the US.

            Ok, now I get what the minorities are scared about now. I didn't see it, but now I see it. But seriously, Trumps not gonna do the whole concentration camp, taking over the world thing, that's so been done to death. Trump's just gonna be HUGE! Oh, and he might eventually kick out some people who will then be in a worse situation, but he's not gonna murder anybody, that's Killary's thing. Relax, it's all cool man.

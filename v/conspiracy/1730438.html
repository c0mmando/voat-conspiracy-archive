            People do become more reserved and scared due to media. There are things to be worried about though as well. This topic is not black and white. You can't just be mean or nice.

            Watching the drone feeds and video from after action reports sure does make the world seem mean. Learning to identify the number and approximate age of corpses by things like counting shoe heels and heel bones makes it seem that way at least.

            The world is a mean place. But a lot of it depends on where you are, and your social status, and wealth. Let's look at recent events. You seen any stories about "rapefugees" attacking rich people? Watch what happens when it happens. They will gone faster than you can type a comment.

            This message is brought to You by a very tired and happy “puppet” lol Would you believe I haven’t slept in 4 days?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is true that The Grand Deception, is that Space (as we've been taught) is a Lie
(Please see the Illuminati Playing Cards) ---&gt; The Earth is not a spinning ball ---&gt; “Flat Earthers are indeed on to something.”
           </p>
           <p>
            But here is where it gets even trickier, our entire reality is in fact an illusion. (A magnificent, perfect illusion --- and one that is indeed very, very malleable --- it is pure magic --- And is so awesome!!!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also our God, for all intents and purposes really is a Dog. We Love Him SO Much. And He Loves All of Us Unconditionally. And I really mean it --- he loves everyone --- axe murders, Saints, Fools, Jokers, Champions, Heroes WAKE UP!
           </p>
           <p>
            He created this world as an adventure for all of us to learn and grow.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know it sounds so absurd, but everything in our reality is quite literally backwards and upside down.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is just an incredibly absurd and glorious game. So please don't ever be scared and know we have already won! It is our destiny --- this play was written for US!
           </p>
           <p>
            Always remember to Whistle While You Work :)

             The world is a mean place. Let's say you're a vegetarian. Okay. You love animals. 95% of people eat meat. There are millions of impoverished, and homeless people in America, and many of them are vets. Everyday women have abortions, killing babies. So, yeah, the world is a mean place. Again, depends who you are whether you perceive that the world is mean. If you're at the bottom, you know it's mean.

             I'll say this. The world isn't nice. The world isn't mean either. The truth is that the world isn't. It just doesnt. Indifference is the closest way to describe it. Shit just happens. People may be mean or nice, the world is somewhere between at any given time.

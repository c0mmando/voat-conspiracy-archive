            Cody Wilson's "Ghost Gun" is an amazing tool.
           </p>
           <p>
            In case you're not familiar with this machine...it's basically a computer-driven mill. It can be used for MANY things...though its intent is to turn "80/80" lower receivers into fully-milled receivers. Unserialized, of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, all of the necessary parts (barrel, gas tube, springs, ejectors, trigger assem, etc, etc, etc.) can easily be purchased on the Internet...no FFL or FOID required.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have one, but it has only seen use as a very accurate milling machine. There is NO doubt in my mind that it would work for its intended purpose. Still, for a "weekend machinist" who needs to, say, mill some billet for a prototype (something) this thing will pay for itself after only a few uses. If it is used as intended, well, it will pay for itself the very first time you mill a lower. BEWARE though as this is super illegal without an FFL...and dangerous to boot.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'd better know a DAMN HUGE amount about semi-auto rifles before you even attempt such a thing. It's not worth risking your life, or someone elses, doing the work that a gunsmith is PAID to do...and usually does very well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, I love the premise, and Cody is a trendsetter. Guns for everyone!! Even if this machine produces NOT ONE gun amongst the hundreds of folks who have shelled out $1,500 for one...just the fact that it CAN should be enough to give the Nazi-like BATFE pause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember folks--history has a LOT to teach us. What's the first thing that a dictatorship does when it wants to completely control the population? They take away the People's firearms. This is yet more HISTORICAL FACT. They also take on an "exclusionary" gun policy--just as you see now with the laws (in Europe) that would only allow Jews to use/concealed carry firearms. Because of, you know, antisemitism and all. No reason not to make them judge, jury, and executioners, right? Why not?? It's the logical next step...and very few Israelis, if any, ever make any court appearances for killing a Palestinian "by accident."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the way it is with the "settlers" that are continuously stealing more and more Palestinian land. These "settlers" (let's call them what they are--thieves) are allowed to carry M16s with them wherever they go...and they tend to take a LOT of potshots at Palestinian kids for throwing rocks and sand--or simply for target practice. After all, the Palestinians are just "...beasts on two legs." according to Menachem Begin...an attitude which, not only stands today and is "valued" more than ever; but has gotten even more extreme. It's quite clear what happens to people like Yitzhak Rabin who want peace between the two "sides"--they get assassinated by their own people!
           </p>
           <p>
            In case you doubt what I'm saying re: dictatorships and guns please see the regimes of (amongst many others) Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Robert Mugabe, Leonid Brezhnev, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, etc, etc, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, this is a great series of articles that I've yet to read--I appreciate these being posted! After ReddactIt I'm trying to do stuff "right" now...all of this information that's interesting goes directly into Evernote...where I can keyword it, date it, and track it. It's easy and may really help someday--especially since the information is offline.

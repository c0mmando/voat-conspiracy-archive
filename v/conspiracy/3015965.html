            If this was just a few dozen "cohencidences" I would be unconvinced. Now that I see this kind of stuff everywhere all the time, it is beyond indoctrination. It is initiation.

            Nope ... it does not the root is the same but the constants are different giving a different word altogether ! It is all about the little pips above the letters different pips you add different vowels, which lead to a different word !
           </p>
           <p>
            This claim is like saying ball, bell, and bull all mean the same thing because they have a B and two L's and disregarding the vowel.

             We are told Columbus sailed west to reach India, but why trust mainstream history HERE when they have lied about so much else? Confirmation bias?
            </p>
            <p>
             Columbus isnt around to actually answer the question of why he sailed west. It may be entirely true that he sailed west to purely explore, as opposed to ever actually trying to find India. It's not like he left america once he realized he wasnt in India, and started searching for the real India.

              Read the web page above and you will see that the lies started not by mainstream history but a fiction author  Washington Irving in 1828 when he published The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus. He also published some highly historical papers like “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow” &lt;/sarcasm&gt;!

              It seems you are confused about the definition and practical applications of a psyop. They can disrupt, confuse, and protract the adversary's decision-making process. PSYOP conveys messages via visual, audio, and audiovisual media. It is all disinformation and of no value whatsoever ! If you want to continue being deceived and being a "useful idiot" for the obvious psyop FE nothing I say is gonna convince you !
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about this honestly the ruler of this world wants to drive you away from God or make you believe he is less powerful than he is I happen to believe in a God who could create a sphere world and a vast universe of mathematical precision, not some silly clockwork that even humans can understand ! So the great deceiver creates lies to discredit the truth like evolution where are the trillions of pieces of evidence Darwin (geologist not biologist) Big Bang to explain away the bible verses that hint at an expanding universe. If you want to find out if your right or not watch some FE debunking videos as the bible says "test all things. Hold fast to what is good." throw out what is not good
             </p>
             <p>
              I personally have discredited FE many times just using the bible and explaining to people what the passages actually mean instead of what they "thought" they did. But unfortunately I do not have more time to waste on nonsense that has been debunked numerous times and has no value whatsoever I throw FE in the same garbage pile that I throw macro evolution, and Big Bang Theory in.

               The Bible actually very clearly supports flat earth. It is the very best proof that the earth is flat. You need to brush up on your Greek and Hebrew, read some word definitions and context, and stop watching the disinfo FE videos, that make up the majority of all FE content available. There is a reason why there is clearly bullshit info being passed as FE informative videos since FE came out. The false FE info discredits the actual truth seeking movement.

                Wrong ... but you do you ! Research the original meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words and find out your wrong ! Throw away the shackles of flat earth, that is limiting your spirtual growth to understand biblical symbolism and meanings you are still pretty much a child spiritually.

                &lt;-- literally means a vast expanse, don't believe me ask a rabbi unfortunately I don't have the vid link of the youtube video with time stamp I could give it to you but unfortunately I lost it may have been on a trey smith vid where he asked a rabbi what that word meant and the answer was "vast expanse" it does not mean what your ilk claims it means.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can continue should I mention the other "buzzwords" your ilk are misunderstanding or not understanding the symbolism like "pillars" (a pillar, prefect, garrison, post) or your misunderstanding about what the word "unmovable" the earth is fixed and immovable in relation to its orbit around the sun. Have you ever known the earth to "unfix" itself and "move" itself out of its orbit around the sun? It doesn't happen, because the earth is fixed and immovable in relation to its orbit around the sun. The earth also is fixed and immovable in relation to us. There has never been a single day in which we had no place to stand, because the earth unfixed itself and moved itself out from under our feet. The earth has always been fixed and immovable, both in relation to us and in relation to its orbit around the sun. In fact, we've learned to take it for granted that the sun will shine during the day and that there will ground for us to stand on when we awake in the morning. Or how stars can be in their "setting" but still be spinning around in a galaxy but always in the same place in relation to the galaxy as a whole ! The “four corners of the earth” refer to “every distant location.” Or the foundation of the earth means the substructure which determines the entire direction (destination) of all that follows in the creation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been declared to you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the foundation of the earth ? He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth (&lt;-- only a globe would be viewed as a circle from all perspectives) ; its dwellers are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a curtain , and spreads them out like a tent to live in. (&lt;--expanding universe  the galaxies may move but the stars stay in their set place in the galaxies)
               </p>
               <p>
                He stretches out the north over empty space ; He hangs the earth upon nothing. &lt;--- no strings, no pillars holding it up, etc
               </p>
               <p>
                Or the fact that the majority of you are encouraged to read the cabal version of the bible (KJV) !

                <p>
                 I have researched the original meanings of the hebrew/Greek using multiple language dictionaries. They all suggest a flat or uncured surface with all the words they use. Like the "face" of the earth? A face is a specific flat shape; not perfectly flat, but it isnt round at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look up platos, I think the word used in old manuscripts is. A circle is a flat polygon, and a sphere is 3d. The hebrews had a word for ball/sphere, yet specifically chose "circle". I guess the omnipotent omniscient creator of everything "got it wrong"? There are many instances of bad and good examples of the suggestions that the earth may be flat in scripture. I'm sorry you've been propagandized by falsehoods perpetrated by Christians who dont believe the plain words of the Bible, and instead claim it doesnt promote a flat earth, when it sincerely obviously does. This is the truth, I've studied this subject for years. I don't even believe the earth is actually flat [I am 50/50], but I cannot deny the objective truth, that the scriptures DO, in fact, promote it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The old Matthew's Bible [predates KJV] even has the words 'flat earth' in it, before they started changing the translated words in the Bible to match up what mystery school practitioners, now lauded as histories best scientists, decided the earth was shaped like.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What, you think we ever went to the moon? If so, I really dont trust the level of detail and honesty you commit to, when studying conspiracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Likewise: no Tesla car went to space, no satellites can withstand the millions of degrees of solar radiation that space would be outside of the atmosphere, or the thousands of degrees celcius that matter in our exosphere heats up to. I could list examples like this all day, and a single one being correct, means the conspiracy is 100% true.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I dont care what the truth ends up being, I just want to know what it is. I have no horse in any race. If a truly biasless person has ever existed, I am them. The Bible clearly promotes flatness in scripture in most mentions of the shape of the earth, and many [not all] of these references ARE NOT symbolic, if you understand how to figure out the honest context of the verse. Dont fall prey to cognitive dissonance or confirmation bias. This is the truth whether you -WANT- to believe it, or not. I dont even believe in flat earth, but I can see it IS a possibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cant show me a curve over water in this day and age, when digital zooms on beaches make invisible ships come back over the horizon.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are even engineers, military pilots, commercial airline pilots [on camera flying a plane] and many others who are on board with flat earth to a degree that I'm not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A 100% true objective fact, is that there is very clearly intentional disinfo being spread in all FE channels about FE. How do you know the content you've seen isnt the false info? And why do you think, for one second, that if the earth isnt really flat, that they would be intentionally creating bullshit FE info? 
Why cant mainstream science actually debunk what FEers believe, instead of intentionally ONLY debunking and ridiculing the disinfo? Those points, and the scripture point, are 75% of why I even entertain the idea of flat earth.

                  You want facts ... Ok you can take a direct flight from Edmonton to japan, yet look at the map of supposed flat earth there on opposite sides of the disk. Compare two points on the world pick a city at one point and choose a city at the complete opposite of the globe note length of day and times for sun rise sunset.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As for the curve I can see it is just so slight due to the size of the earth, I think that was designed for our comfort.

                   The fact that you cited the FAKE flat earth info to be debunked that NO real flat earthers believe, shows you have no idea what a real flat earthers actually believe. Unhinge from the dissonance, friend. I feel like I wasted too much time writing my last comment, that you didnt even read it. My last long comment is still a solid refute to this one.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I can tell by what you've said it doesnt matter if I showed you a Polaroid from space of a flat earth, you would still deny it. You're operating under the assumption that 1. Anyone saying anything about FE is automatically wrong and that 2. Anyone promoting a sphere is automatically right. You already "know" it is spherical; you will not view or consider or critically think about any valid evidence that contradicts what you already assume to be true.

            but does it also mean The NOSE? everytime someone is lying the nose will grow longer. now the NASA is actually extending into space and has already reached the moon in the 1970ies. now the nose is basically everywhere, if you believe it.

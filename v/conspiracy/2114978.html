            Its unregulated money movement.

            PERIOD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its the only thing it brings to the table: and incredibly inefficiently (cost to run network is STAGGERING). . Don't matter: people will pay that premuium to avoid gov't fuckery. And paying people to to assist them? Boo-ya. -BTC has flaws however. And lurking killers. Not just the users.
           </p>
           <p>
            btw: I'd say 10% of BTC people own 90% of the btc at this point. Classic wealth inequality #'s.

            Bitcoin is a virtual commodity.  It may be entirely virtual, just ones and zeros, but it possesses a lot of the same attributes as real world commodities which have been used as money, and lacks some of the attributes which plague modern-day currency.  It can also be transmitted digitally, without some government-run clearing house restricting it.  The main thing giving it value is, some people want it, for whatever reason.

             best part is it can't be printed willy-nilly like it is today by our friends at the fed reserve.  everytime they print more money than they take in it lowers the value of the one in your pocket.  it is a form of theft.

             It's popularity coincided with a war on cash (allegedly to stop crime), a great increase in asset forfeiture of large cash movements (again), and the asset forfeiture of 50% of the market share of bitcoin with mt gox hacks, closure of silk road and silk road 2 and then alphabay -- all seized by us authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, also, no normal person can get into bitcoin once it hit about 800, now it's what over 4k?  Entry level mining is done, you now have to either gamble by mining in the cloud or just buy bitcoin
            </p>
            <p>
             Where do you buy bitcoin?
            </p>
            <p>
             From exchanges
            </p>
            <p>
             WHo runs the exchanges?
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you know? Do you?  You don't, because you can't. Because they dont' disclose the silent partners
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very likely the US government under a cover of the silent partner
            </p>
            <p>
             After all, they were caught running the drug purity testing labs for cartels.  YEP, on darknet.  Most of the operators on darknet are purported to be agents.  I mean that's kind of common sense right
            </p>
            <p>
             It is to me at least.
            </p>
            <p>
             So like in any business if you own 50% of the market share and you control the exchanges that have the unique position of reporting the current market price of bitcoin, what's to say you don't manipulate that price?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's an illusion.  The same thing with the US stocks and bonds markets. Everyone likes to think that the market is 'running itself' and no one knows what it will do
            </p>
            <p>
             The reality is that if you are in the special elite multimillion dollar buy in club, then you get access to high frequency trading tools and special VIP discounts that let you do huge trades without paying the same kind of trading fees us stupid retard plebes have to pay
            </p>
            <p>
             Couple that with being in an even more exclusive club: the political elite who kowtow to the CIA non-official covers of CIA Deepstate.  When you're in that club
            </p>
            <p>
             (and you have to let yourself get drugged on an Epstain pleasure island so that you then get filmed raping a kid...that's the initiation into this club, let's call it the Kalzoni Kid nap Klubb )
            </p>
            <p>
             So when you join Kalzoni Kidnap Klubb in DC, they give you a blackberry that's configured so that Hillary Clinton can read all your emails
            </p>
            <p>
             Anything you do in Gmail is of course, property of the CIA also, given that Google was started BY the CIA with InQTel.  And of course, NSA has a program thinthread i believe that 'collects it all', to build a deep dive disposition profile on every citizen in the US via fusion centers all over the country, that collate all information about a person from vast and disparate databases so that nsa operators can just put in your name and know nearly everything about you down to the shemale porn and rosemary soap you got your girlfriend three christmases ago
            </p>
            <p>
             Since their in everyones' email, they can front-run on any good ideas you have.  I am someone who has good ideas all the time and I put them into google docs.  Between 2006 or so and now, almost 90% of my ideas have come to market.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  I just get pissed off everyt time it happens because unlike the CIA I don't have trillions of black budget money to throw at my "good ideas", like the fucking hiker french press which I know for a FACT that someone stole from my email, down to the twisting mechanism that folded out like a very particular plant.  That's when I knew this situation was much more F'd up than anyone could possibly imagine
            </p>
            <p>
             SO, if you belong to the Killary Kidnap Klub...oh sorry I mean KALZONI Klubb then the benefit that has you endebted to Hillary, the 7th floor group, the US Military basically / Nato / CIA is that they give you 'pay for plays' and set up ratlines for you and then make you operate them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stolen luxury cars being shipped to UAE with weapons (DU weapons, WP, or something worse) in them, run by of course your favorite gang of the decade (MS13, or Somalis), and then shipping back pre 1992 cars without GPS with drugs in them, so that you can run hit jobs and other crimes with them.  It's a neat idea
            </p>
            <p>
             But most of all in addition to running the ratlines and making huge money selling illegal arms that turn say the middle east into a million year radioactive cesspool and burning white phosphorus off a little Yemeni girl's face;
            </p>
            <p>
             YOu get a bonus thing which is that you get to know which contracts are going to be granted; you know which "plays" are going to be made by the military ('we're going into Yemen next"), and since you have this foreknowledge you can invest or sell short the 'losers' those military contractors and subcontractors
            </p>
            <p>
             That's how you front-run the market place
            </p>
            <p>
             I call this in-spy-der trading
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             What's this shit all got to do with Bitcoin, you may finally ask?
            </p>
            <p>
             Well bitcoin is a way for them to
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              ) more easily move their ratline money amongst each other
             </li>
             <li>
              ) it's not anonymous but they can use the exchanges as a 'cut out', that's why the proliferation of crypto ICOs like we all can't collectively decide that ether or monero is the best...or to take the idea of monero and 'etherize' it and then say 'hey everyone get off bitcoin...this is better'.  This wont happen
             </li>
             <li>
              ) It's actually easier to manipulate the market using crypto than stocks, the idea that currency would be as volatile as a penny stock is their pie in the sky
             </li>
             <li>
              ) It makes people think they are anarchic in a time where trust in the gov is at an all time low
             </li>
             <li>
              ) If there's a moment where they induce a crash, well you've just traded all your dollars for something worthless haven't you?  Too bad you didn't do the really lame thing and invest in somethign stable like gold.  Germany is doing that.  Germany is right in this
             </li>
             <li>
              ) ONe thing I learned from the deepstate (ie freemasons/jesuits ideologically) is that they like to honeypot their enemy and then blow it up.  Bitcoin could be like this--invest all your money in bitcoin and that's a way to trade in your dollars for something worthless.  Then blow up bitcoin to nothing, and you've effectively stolen everyone's money.  Keep in mind, your'e TRADING something.  You're not investing.  Someone is getting your money for monopoly money.  I call this, "invite them all in and open the trapdoor to hell" technique (thanks '/r/sphinxclub and
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/brotherspartacus">
               /u/brotherspartacus
              </a>
              ')
             </li>
             <li>
              ) EMP that would happen because the Spy ring in congress story threatened to bring down the whole US government and then OOPS North Korea sent a EMP nuke how convenient.  Well there goes bitcoin there too.  And your kindle books.  Sorry.  No access to money for months. OOps the server where you kept your wallet is gone also.  Oops all ...it's all gone. (USE A PAPER WALLET and offline computer to print to it)
             </li>
             <li>
              ) This the last thing I'll say and this is the most important threat.  Quantum computers are now at 2000 qbits which means theoretically they could decrypt the blockchain

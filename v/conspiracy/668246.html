   Semi-Rant: It has taken some time, but I have come to the slow realization that everything I thought I knew about the world is a product of propaganda, truth twisting, and outright fabrication.

            I played this game when I was around 12 or 13 years old and it blew my mind. It's really shaped my views on everything that's been happening since then.

            Excellent points. People harp on about how awake and red-pilled they are when we've only began to understand how the game even works, let alone play it properly. We're running around like headless chickens talking about censorship and freedom of speech while having no problem being brainwashed as long as it's comfortable. Don't challenge the 6 gorririon narrative you dumb goy, instead worry about not getting knifed or shot by some third worlder.

            What a game. I feel MGS went downhill after the third one, great clip.

             I used to think I was one of those "awakened" ones, and the past year has been rough because the lies have been so apparent. It's like you can't buy into anything like you used to. It's not a fear of trust or anything, you just realize it's like putting your faith in smoke, when the whole thing is smoke, what do you do?
            </p>
            <p>
             I've never played MGS, but this video really makes me want to because of how  deeply applicable this has become, especially with modern context. Context will never hold the same meaning after this. Entire frames of reference are already in place, the matrix of thought is already here.
            </p>
            <p>
             How can we really be free if freedom is just a concept that is created from a frame of reference that we cannot control, i.e. the universe? Is it possible to really be free or are we always going to be bound by the limitations presented to us through the entire platform from which we percieve even the most subtle forms of reality? how can we really think outside the box when everything is the box? Can we really be so detached from bias that truth will emerge from the cosmos?
            </p>
            <p>
             What is the cosmos? Our own understanding of the cosmos does not change what the cosmos could really be, but we will never really know, will we? How do we remove this lens that distorts reality yet also lets us view it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is our body the lens? Are we limited by our bodily perceptions to the point that we can never really arrive at truth until we are not bound by the body?
            </p>
            <p>
             Wouldn't that mean death? Is the search for truth a plight of death?
            </p>
            <p>
             That sounds a little preemptive. I don't know what one would do in the absence of truth, but are we really supposed to wait until some untold death sequence to know the
             <em>
              real
             </em>
             truth?
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you think?
            </p>
            <p>
             I think I'm going to go have a nap.

              At the end of the day they're all just models and different ways of perceiving and understanding the world. Most are viable in some ways, some more useful to others but as you say, it all comes down to ones perspective and coming to a true understanding of how another perceives the world is always going to be extremely difficult. Particularly when you consider undiagnosed mental illnesses, or the increasing prevalence of synesthesia among newer generations which can completely change how people perceive the world. I went out with a girl with synesthesia and they are perceiving everything differently. She was going around for most of her life presuming most people perceived the world this way since she wasn't properly diagnosed. Words, letters, objects, numbers and people all have an associated colour. Individual letters and numbers have their own distinct colour but when combined with other letters and numbers the colours combine to give a new colour. All sounds stupid but the net effect of this is people can much more easily remember things, stats, numbers etc particularly if they are studying or researching something.

              Above was kind of a side point but it's just to illustrate where we stand I guess in terms of mutual understanding. In terms of our understanding of the cosmos, physics, quantum mechanics, etc I would refer to my first sentence. Any field comes with an implied disclaimer that fundamental principles can and will change and sometimes upend the whole field. A degree of caution is always worthwhile with any study but I feel archaeology is probably a good but slightly extreme example to illustrate this since it has active political components (the "victors") constantly forcing it's own narrative onto history and thus skewing true understanding actively.

              I think when you talk about the cosmos you have to look at uniform patterns, structures and designs which exist regardless of the zoom level you take from nano, to cellular, to planetary and intergalactic. Whether it's looking down at the cells of our own bodies all coexisting and working away to make sure everybody continues to live to the worker ant fulfilling his own specialised task in an ant farm, all seek survival. Same if you take a top-down look over shibuya crossing. Ultimately it's all a struggle for survival. I have a friend who is published for developing a nanotech delivery mechanism for for cancer and he was really interesting to talk to. If you come across people who do work at the subatomic level definitely have a chat with them.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "It’s an astonishing thought that 99.9% of what an atom is, is nothing. In other words, one of the smallest units that collectively make up solid matter is almost entirely a vacuum or empty space. Ergo, we are mostly nothing, and the universe is mostly nothing. If all this empty space were to be removed from a person, they would be the size of a grain of salt (which would still weigh the same as the person did before being deflated). This radical realisation leads physicists to thinking of atoms as tendencies rather than as things. To illustrate, if we were to liken the dense nucleus of an atom to a pin-head, the electrons that orbit the nucleus would be roughly a kilometer away. Another comparison is that of a fly buzzing in an empty cathedral."

              Some of quantum theory contradicts this in that the act of somebody simply witnessing something regardless of disance and proximity causes a change in state.

              PS if you get a chance also do LSD or Mushrooms, anything with psilocybin since it temporarily removes all the white noise and conditioning from a person for a couple of hours. If it's your first time do it at home with somebody you trust and don't drink alcohol.

               That block quote was intense. I've had similar experiences while tripping, the sensory experience was especially pronounced with LSD. Everything I saw was associated with color at times, even hearing sound. The fluid nature of the universe is really quite astonishing and is always questioning the idea that we have solid fixed points to begin with.

            Ive spent the last decade trying to find ANYTHING that could make a difference. And im not claiming im smarter than you. But if you were THAT much smarter than me then they would have already hired or killed you.

            Yeah but even if you dont say "oh dear" i dare you, no i defy you to make a difference. You wont. You will waste your life and at best accomplish nothing. At worst your actions will be used to further their goals instead of your own.

            Yeah. Our entire lives are fabricated. The conflict in the middle east is all deliberately manufactured starting waaay back when we put the jews there after WW2. Everything about our foreign and domestic policies are lies. Our govt is not sovereign, it is owned and controlled by the world banks. And there isnt a damn thing any of us can do to change it because the same people have controlled all the money for centuries, and if any one of us were smart enough to beat them they would have hired or killed us by now.

            We're only a few centuries removed from being barbarian hordes and a few millennia removed from being hunter gatherers. One of the systems that allows us to exist as the civilization that we are is the lies we deceive ourselves with. To abandon those lies you become a law unto yourself, unless you can convince others to join in your new lies. You cannot have humans group together without shared lies, mutual interests, or overwhelming force. We are a defective species that way; we became the dominant species on Earth that way.

            Wasting our time?!

            Dude, when you wake up you are no longer a SLAVE. Congratulations!
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for joining the collective.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking from personal experience: Once you do more digging and confirm basically everything you've listed (and more), you will go through these psychological cycles. First is the cognitive dissonance (which you have already suffered) when all the logical pieces start to connect and begin to "wake up".  Then is a period of red anger towards everything that is apart of this "system". Followed by the feeling of lethargy. Don't stay trapped in this "lethargy" stage. You will notice that you will become increasingly nihilistic towards everything- this is not healthy, nor productive, but it happens. Finally once over coming all of this you are able to DO something about it. Making people you love and care about grow more aware of the tyranny going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Information is power. Which is why TPTB are doing everything they can to control the flow of information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be aware of misinformation as well. This journey you go through will train you to follow the truth- not shills on your mind-control box (yes its called tv "programming" for a reason - Research MKULTRA).
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I wanted to add since I have seen other comments say the same thing; In order to change the world, you first have to change yourself. Meditation comes in all shapes and sizes, I recommend finding what works for you. Me personally, walking through nature is very calming and allows me to self reflect. Nature also doesnt bombard you with advertisements

             Some people really can't handle that. Humans have been selectively bred to be sheep. On a smaller scale, a lot of people can't even handle something like a psilocybin trip because it reveals to much.

              Trip balls a few times and your life perception changes completely. I did LSD, Shrooms, E and all that shit for a year in my early 20's. Really opened my mind in ways that few people can come to grips with. I'm 36 now...God I want to trip again but don't know anyone....at least the memory remains.

                Do you have a link to a concise explanation of stoicism? I tried to read some I found on google, but couldn't follow what they were talking about.
               </p>
               <p>
                edit. I found this one. " To conduct conforming to the precepts of the Stoics, as repression of emotion and indifference to pleasure or pain."
               </p>
               <p>
                I don't follow that line of thinking. I enjoy my emotions, without letting them take over my sense of logic. Being indifferent to them, would be denying who and what I am as a human being.

                  The ancient philosophy of Epictetus, Seneca the Younger, and Marcus Aurelius, among others. Stoicism focuses on living a virtuous life, and devoting yourself fully to your task at hand, while stressing indifference to the events outside of your control. Stoicism teaches that the quality of life depends entirely on the individual, and that events can only make you persistently depressed or unhappy when you are a faggot.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Stoics experience emotion like any other person, they have just realized that it is a self-harming choice to allow emotions to effect your well-being after the initial emotional reaction has passed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  A Stoic is, in effect, the extreme polar opposite of an emo.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is what urban dictionary had to say about the topic. Is that accurate enough?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I read the short list you posted. I consider violent feelings a natural part of being a human being. Wanting to beat up someone when they fucked me over is healthy. Not doing it because the consequences might be detrimental to my well being is being logical.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are some good things so far that I have read about stoicism. However saying it's exactly my philosophy about how to live life would not be accurate.

                That is my philosophy. Take the best of what is out there and make it part of my methodology. It's not me trying to tell you I got a prophesy, but that using your own ability to change your life is how you form your future, instead of wanting to rewrite history. Oops. Been listening to some new rap. You get the idea.

            Is it, OP? Is "everything you thought you knew about the world a product of propaganda"?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm trying to save you a bit of sanity, here -- not be a dick. I'm a bit worried about your user name, but I'll trust first, I guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            What do you "know" about the world? A better question might be "How do I know the things I believe about the world?" A lot of philosophers seem to think there are two methods of "knowing": rationalism and empiricism. The first are things that you can deduce from "known" rules -- math, ethics, hard proofs. These tend to be absolute but based on human definitions. (Consider the whole field of economics. You can "prove" that a minimum wage causes unemployment, etc.) The second are things that you "know" from experience: politicians lie, banks always cheat people, there was a war in Viet Nam... I suspect much of this empirical knowledge is still in place for you! (Yay?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, there's a layer of "analysis" that is subject to debate. And the plausible conclusions change as you add empirical knowledge. This revelation, however, agrees with a piece of the unshakable, rationalist knowledge: argument from authority is not a valid justification. The scary part of this realization is that much of our mental terrain is a gray area, which we have to explore and map tentatively.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watch out, though. You can't replace one authority with another and achieve anything. Swapping a Pantaglossian "Truth, Justice, and the American Way!" for a nihilistic "It's all the Illuminati!" is just replacing one authority with another. In fact, whenever ideas "snap" together, I tend to believe it's a sign that my mind is getting tired (usually from constant rationalization of conflicting ideas) and I'm starting to accept whatever shit is in front of me.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can engineer these moments. If you have ever sailed, you know that the wind applies one pressure, the water applies another, and the vector of motion is opposed to both of them. Now imagine that the "official narrative of events" is the wind. They're both rather changeable. Let your "cultural backdrop" be the water. It's more or less constant. What you believe to be your free thoughts is the "motion of the boat". You don't have to merely accept the "official narrative" -- opposition can be managed, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll be okay, I think. Did you honestly expect that all people were good? That they were honest? That they had other people's best interests at heart? When has this
            <em>
             ever
            </em>
            been true? Is it true for you? It's no shame to take your own side in a fight. For some reason, our "cultural backdrop" demonizes taking our own side as imperialist, or "unforgiving" or something. It enables people to lie to themselves well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just keep exploring and questioning -- and be aware that if you have a emotional response ("I am just sickened by the scale and depth of the manipulation") that is a) not a thought b) not necessarily true and c) probably useful to someone else.

             I think it would be better if he would have said "everything he was told" or "everything he was taught", but he didn't expect it to be picked apart like that.

             Well said. I am frustrated that the wind and the water are, at times, a mirage. Even a sailor knows that without real wind, or water, you cannot sail. I have always been aware that Walter Benjamin's notion "history is written by the victors" was effectively true; I guess I am just discouraged by the long term complexity, and saturation of disinformation. It would be nice, once in a while, to be able to read/hear facts, without some obscuring underlying agenda. To be able to "trust".

              It's cool, man. Hell, in my experience you can't even trust voat. Anonymity lets us speak openly, but also sock puppet. (There's no way in hell what I wrote merited 6 independent opinions...)

             <p>
              Sailors never trust the sea... I think sometimes people try to make themselves the victor by actively writing the history. Don't be discouraged. Just live your life! Collect your experiences; make your analyses and let others find their paths. So... Trust but verify? (I think that was Reagan and it sounds right to me...) It's all a story. And facts can push the truth around. Just enjoy the ride. I've seen conspiracists fall down

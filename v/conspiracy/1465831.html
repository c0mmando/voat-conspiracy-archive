<p>JonBenet had expressed discomfort to her mother concerning her \'private place\' about two months before her death. Beginning approximately two weeks before her murder, she began to talk about scary people in long, black robes who gathered around her and stuck \'things\' into her private place - things that hurt her. She also spoke vaguely of darkness around her and the possible use of candles.</p>
<p>Several of the Ramsey\'s friends, friends from their Church, heard this along with several of her teachers and questioned her about it. After JB\'s murder they went to the Police with the information, but apparently due to the DA, nothing ever came of it. The friends from the Church abruptly ended their relationships with the Ramsey\'s and several of them openly stated they thought them guilty of murdering their daughter.</p>
<p>Both Denver and Boulder, are major Satanic centers whose activities have, at various times been under investigation by Jefferson and Denver county authorities as well as the FBI and others. A witness of these activities came fourth and gave testimony of two crack babies that were first taken from their parents and given to foster parents.</p>
<p>Later they were taken from the foster parents by Denver SOCIAL SERVICES after the husband was murdered in very strange circumstances and were given to a single woman who had turned up out of nowhere after the murder and offered to be a nanny to the children. The witness claims watching the ritual sacrifice of both babies, twins, on Halloween, in a sequestered area in the mountains outside of Boulder with the Ramsey\'s, the Ramsey\'s close, wealthy friend and associate (her controller), DA Alex Hunter, Lt. Governor Gail Shoettler, Lou Smith, and several others \'very high up\' in Colorado politics, linked directly to the Governor\'s office.</p>
<p>The Satanic ring centered in Denver connects into Boulder and Sedalia, CO, as well as other communities such as Sedona, Omaha, and many others. The coroner and investigator, Dr. Wecht, says that the evidence proves that her death happened during sexual abuse by her parents.</p>
<p><strong>JB was murdered on Christmas Eve and Josef Mengele created a sacrificial ritual for this date called &quot;The Last Bulb of the Christmas Tree&quot;. Mengele\'s pseudonym, Greenbaum, means green tree and relates to the Cabalistic Tree of Life.</strong></p>
<p>A Brotherhood term for the devil is JonBet. </p>
<p>The Witness also claims that she\'s been the victim of a child-sex ring whose participants included this wealthy friend of the Ramsey family.  She had been victimized since early childhood, she said, by a subculture, including members of her own family, that used children for sex.</p>
<p>One of the men who had participated in the abuse was this friend of the Ramsey\'s, and she has documentation proving at least her family\'s connection to this individual.</p>
<p>John Ramsey ran a company called Access Graphics with offices in the Philippines, Amsterdam, Holland and Denver. Access Graphics did business with the William Morris Agency and had service contracts directly with what is commonly known as Iran-Contra. Access Graphics major bank accounts were parked at the noted Iran-Contra money-laundry Silverado Savings and Loan and administered by none other than Director of Silverado, Neil Bush, George W. Bush\'s brother. Ramsey was also on a list of witnesses never subpoenaed by former Iran-Contra Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. It can now be reported that Ramsey had either knowingly, or unknowingly, pimped his daughter out as a prostitute to the Wm. Morris Agency who were taking these child \'Models\' and using them to provide sexual services for pedophiles in Government, Industry and so on in addition to their Modeling shows (shows often displayed in video footage in the many news specials on JonBenet\'s murder).</p>
<p>John Ramsey must stay silent given his position as a Bush-Clinton crime syndicate asset or risk having the truth come out about this entire, horrid affair. Something he has done quite well up to this juncture.</p>
<p>Search warrants also turned up disturbing nude photos of the Ramsey children.</p>
<p>In the three years prior to her death, JB made 33 trips to the pediatrician, diagnosis was &quot;yeast infections&quot;. Yeast infections for a child of four to six years old?</p>
<p>The Ramsey\'s ex-housekeeper, Linda Hoffmann-Pugh, testified to the Boulder County Grand Jury that Patsy killed her daughter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Psalm 118:27b, interpreted as the source of the $118,000 ransom demand, &quot;Decorate the festival with leafy boughs and bind the sacrifices to be offered with thick cords to the horns of the altar&quot; is commonly cited by &quot;white supremacists,&quot; who &quot;use the redemption and sacrifice ideas to form a justification for killings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What we believe was happening in Patsy\'s mind was that her daughter was losing control, becoming a wild rebel. She felt (her daughter) was becoming evil.&quot; Why would a lovely, 6-year-old child be deemed as becoming evil?</p>
<p>The child-porn ring being run out of Denver uses child \'models\' for sexual favors. JB was one of those \'models\'.</p>

<hr />
<p>Was John Ramsey\'s 22-year-old daughter, <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/16/interview-15-years-after-jonbenet-ramseys-death-a-father-looks-back/">Beth,</a> murdered in a car wreck because she knew what was going on?  The Boulder police ordered Beth\'s death records and autopsy to be sealed in 1997.</p>
<p>Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006.</p>
<p>The Clinton News Network reported that the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/07/09/jonbenet.dna/">Ramseys passed a DNA test in 2008.</a></p>
<p>Burke Ramsey was almost 10 at the time of his sister\'s murder.  <a href="http://www.drphil.com/videos/jonbenet-ramseys-brother-on-why-he-stayed-in-his-bedroom-after-hearing-his-sister-was-missing/">Here he is being really creepy</a> and <a href="http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ac971b56878a942c120bcfd8ab537a94">smiley</a> in Sept 2016 on Dr. Phil. </p>

<p>&quot;After coming home from a Christmas dinner, John carried JonBenet upstairs to bed while Patsy served nine-year-old Burke some pineapple in the kitchen downstairs, the theory goes.</p>
<p>&quot;But instead of sleeping through the night, JonBenet came back downstairs from her bedroom, and tried to steal some of her brother’s food.</p>
<p>&quot;This was the last straw for Burke, who grabbed the nearby flashlight — and hit his sister on the head.</p>
<p>&quot;What the investigators did stress is that her death wasn’t intentional, but rather a tragic accident.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/_-QYhlFIefY">language expert</a> analyzing Burke\'s interview.  Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9vYp7bIXFt60Mi2Sne9kvcFjYBsrCjud">a playlist</a> of more Burke interviews.</p>
<p>From Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet? by A. James Kolar; pages 367-70:
&quot;I had reviewed an investigator’s report that documented a 1997 interview with former Ramsey nanny - housekeeper Geraldine Vodicka, who stated that Burke had smeared feces on the walls of a bathroom during his mother’s first bout with cancer. She told investigators that Patsy\'s mother, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/e7/ab/7fe7abf5b55b31a3f37a81e588afd2e4.jpg">Nedra Paugh</a>, who was visiting the Ramsey home at the time, had directed her to clean up the mess. (A family friend suggested that Burke had been caught &quot;playing doctor&quot; with JonBenet in Atlanta, was he also molested?  Was he molesting JB?  Was he involved in her murder and his parents tried to cover for him?  Did he see something and was MKUltra\'d into forgetting?)</p>
<p>&quot;There were other police reports in the files that documented what I thought could be viewed as related behavior. CSIs had written about finding a pair of pajama bottoms in JonBenet\'s bedroom that contained fecal material. They were too big for her and were thought to belong to Burke.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/brother-of-jonbenet-reveals-who-he-thinks-killed-his-younger-sister/news-story/be59b35ce7c3c86b5b5142ae01d415e6">But Dr Spitz</a> believes the beauty queen’s death was because of a late night confrontation with her older brother.</p>
<p>“They, I mean the police department over there, were quite aware of who the killer is likely to be, from inception almost,” Dr Spitz said.</p>
<p>“They came here to Detroit to talk to me, they had me come down there, we talked about the incident … It was probably the mother or the brother, now it turns out.”</p>
<p>Dr Spitz alleged Burke, who now works on computers, as having a “mental problem”.</p>
<p>“The brother is not exactly thinking straight, the behavior is…of somebody who’s got a problem. When I think of putting feces in the sister’s bed… He was doing that,” he said.</p>

           From Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet? by A. James Kolar; pages 367-70:
"I had reviewed an investigator’s report that documented a 1997 interview with former Ramsey nanny - housekeeper Geraldine Vodicka, who stated that Burke had smeared feces on the walls of a bathroom during his mother’s first bout with cancer. She told investigators that Patsy's mother,
           <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7f/e7/ab/7fe7abf5b55b31a3f37a81e588afd2e4.jpg">

           </a>
           , who was visiting the Ramsey home at the time, had directed her to clean up the mess. (A family friend suggested that Burke had been caught "playing doctor" with JonBenet in Atlanta, was he also molested?  Was he molesting JB?  Was he involved in her murder and his parents tried to cover for him?  Did he see something and was MKUltra'd into forgetting?)
          </p>
          <p>
           "There were other police reports in the files that documented what I thought could be viewed as related behavior. CSIs had written about finding a pair of pajama bottoms in JonBenet's bedroom that contained fecal material. They were too big for her and were thought to belong to Burke.

           believes the beauty queen’s death was because of a late night confrontation with her older brother.

          <p>
           “They, I mean the police department over there, were quite aware of who the killer is likely to be, from inception almost,” Dr Spitz said.
          </p>
          <p>
           “They came here to Detroit to talk to me, they had me come down there, we talked about the incident … It was probably the mother or the brother, now it turns out.”

           “The brother is not exactly thinking straight, the behavior is…of somebody who’s got a problem. When I think of putting feces in the sister’s bed… He was doing that,” he said.

             Yeah I saw this. Kinda creepy. I am going to look at the ransom note that was written because  there is some sort of code in it according to the author  of this creepy confession. If I find a code then I will believe it. Other than that I remain skeptical. Very creepy read and very long winded too.

            DA keeps lid on Ramsey death probe
           </p>
           <p>
            By Charlie Brennan, Rocky Mountain News
           </p>
           <p>
            February 10, 2003
           </p>
           <p>
            BOULDER - More than a month after the JonBenet Ramsey murder investigation was put in the hands of the Boulder District Attorney's Office, there is little outward sign of activity in the probe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last week, District Attorney Mary Keenan renewed her vow not to discuss how she is proceeding in the case in any detail.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We do have a team of people working on it, but I'm not going to say anything further than that," Keenan said. She added, however: "They are doing other things as well."
           </p>
           <p>
            The only confirmed development is the renewed involvement of retired Colorado Springs homicide detective Lou Smit, who firmly believes John and Patsy Ramsey are innocent in their 6-year-old daughter's Christmas night 1996 murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I've got to keep a real low profile," said Smit, who is not being paid by the Boulder district attorney. "Any time she wants me, I'm going to assist in any way I can," Smit said. "I know what her policy is. I just have to stay down low and help when I can and where I can."
           </p>
           <p>
            It's hard to ascertain who, other than Smit, is handling Ramsey investigative work for Keenan's office - or what they are doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is known is this:
           </p>
           <p>
            • Keenan has not asked Boulder police for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            • She has not asked the Boulder County Sheriff's Department for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            • She has not asked the Colorado Bureau of Investigation for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            • She has not asked former prosecutor Michael Kane, who directed the Ramsey grand jury probe, for help.
           </p>
           <p>
            • She has not asked her county commissioners for more money.
           </p>
           <p>
            Newly elected Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle, who in November left his post as commander of detectives in the Boulder Police Department for his new county job, has heard nothing from Keenan.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I have not had a conversation with Mary Keenan concerning the Ramsey case, not even in passing," Pelle said. "As far as I know, they're doing it in-house."
           </p>
           <p>
            Lin Wood, the Ramseys' Atlanta attorney, wrote to Keenan Oct. 9 to say he was prepared to file a lawsuit on the Ramseys' behalf to get the case out of the hands of Boulder police. He charged that they had lost all objectivity in the case and had also ignored a Sept. 16 letter from him offering new leads.
           </p>
           <p>
            The subsequent announcement on Dec. 20 that Keenan would indeed take control of the investigation was applauded by Wood, who no longer plans to sue the Boulder police. He has faith that Keenan's efforts will be substantial.

            "Without going into specifics, there is no question in my mind that this is a legitimate investigation," Wood said. "I do know there are individuals who are working the case."
           </p>
           <p>
            Keenan's investigative staff consists of the same two people who were on board before her office took command of the Ramsey case - veteran investigator Linda Wickman and former Fort Wayne, Ind., police officer Joe De Angelo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most people associated with the Ramsey probe are keeping their mouths shut - at Keenan's request.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Boulder police Chief Mark Beckner, who agreed in December to pass the Ramsey case to Keenan's office after six years of work by his department that produced no arrests and thoroughly alienated JonBenet's parents, is following the silence-is-golden policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I'm out of the loop on that one," he said. "I wouldn't mind talking to you, but Mary has expressed some desire to not talk about anything."
           </p>
           <p>
            Other elected officials also are getting the cold shoulder. County Commissioner Paul Danish said he made a comment to Keenan on the Ramsey case at a recent social function.
           </p>
           <p>
            "She just changed the subject," Danish said.
           </p>

            While no member of Keenan's staff will discuss its capacity for handling a complicated murder probe, former Assistant Boulder District Attorney Bill Wise said major homicide investigations are way outside the scope of what that office's investigators typically handle.
           </p>
           <p>
            "As of the time that I was last there, two years ago, we did not have investigators trained to do a homicide investigation," Wise said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another veteran investigator who has worked on the Ramsey case extensively, and would speak only on the condition of anonymity, is skeptical that Keenan's investigators can accomplish much in the case without outside assistance.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Boulder P.D. has worked this case for six years and has accumulated thousands and thousands of interviews, investigative notes, scientific examinations and results," the investigator said. "And now, you give it to somebody brand new and expect them to even process this?"
           </p>
           <p>
            That investigator also questions the renewed involvement of Smit, who worked the Ramsey case under Keenan's predecessor but quit in September 1998 when it became clear that Kane's grand jury probe would focus on John and Patsy Ramsey as top suspects. That 13-month grand jury yielded no indictments.
           </p>
           <p>
            "If the criticism is that the Boulder P.D. has not been objective," said the veteran investigator, "then why would you hire somebody else who has shown that they are not objective, but at the other extreme?"
           </p>
           <p>
            But Smit maintains he is not an advocate for or against the Ramseys and is only after the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I work strictly for JonBenet, period," Smit said.

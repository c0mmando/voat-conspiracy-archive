            I've never been one to be worried about vaccines too much.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's one of those conspiracies that I can get why people are worried but it's not something that has had me personally worried or fearful before now.
           </p>
           <p>
            That being said, I've never been a shoot me up with anything type of person.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the polio vaccine there's no doubt that it has helped almost erase polio off the face of the Earth, so I'm all for having that vaccine, I also had the meningitis one after my brother had contracted meningitis as a baby.
           </p>
           <p>
            All that being said things like the flu vaccine have always left me feeling uneasy, it's impossible to get rid of the flu due to the thousands of different variations of the flu.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've worked in care and caring for others (specifically the elderly) for years and each year I've decided to get the flu vaccine because I figured despite my reservations about the vaccine I don't want to pass the flu onto an elderly person and them die from it, I didn't want that on my conscience.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, for the past few years I've had the flu jab... NEVER again!
           </p>
           <p>
            Before I had it, it was very rare I'd get the flu, wouldn't even get it yearly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every year I've had the flu vaccine I've become so badly ill, unable to move out of bed with the flu!
           </p>
           <p>
            My partner is the same as well, honestly, right now I can't see any other cause than it being the flu vaccine so I've said to myself, after having the flu vaccine and becoming severely ill with the flu this year, in the future I will not be getting to flu jab anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still not the type of person to be totally against vaccines altogether but I am more vigilant, the amount of vaccines that a baby MUST have before leaving the hospital now is a joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some vaccines are vital in ridding us of diseases like Polio but some are just unnecessary and are probably doing us more harm than good, like the flu vaccine.

             Actually over 90% of polio cases are symptom free and people didn't even know they had it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also there was Doctor named Dr. Fred Klenner who successfully treated polio patients with high doses of vitamin c. He had a 100% cure rate. But I'm sure you have never heard of him because his success and his findings were suppressed because the polio vaccine was ready to be rolled out. Don't need a vaccine when there's a cure!

             We have been manipulated and lied to for decades all in the name of profits.

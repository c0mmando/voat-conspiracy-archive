            Paul was replaced.  Of that there can be no doubt.  I don't think the scholarship is there yet to say they were all replaced, but I'm not ruling it out.

            Howard Hughes is another one.  Same time frame.  Went to great lengths to not have to appear in public, after being a publicity hound only about a decade earlier.  Killed/died, and replaced.  Hughes aircraft were used for CIA drug trafficking in those early days.

            I've done extensive research into the "Paul is Dead" conspiracy and the clues and there are three scenarios that are possible:
1) Paul McCartney died in a car crash and because the Beatles were having such a strong economic impact on Britain, the decision was made to replace him. The other three went along, but hid clues in their music and album artwork.
2) The Beatles decided to play an elaborate practical joke on the world based on the "Paul is Dead" rumors and planted those clues to f*ck with people. And given John and George's sense of humor, it is possible.
3) Paul didn't die, the clues were unintentional and people read too much into them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, if you look at the evidence, #3 is the least plausible explanation. The first two are the only two that make sense, but you would think if it was a big joke, that someone in the band would have admitted to it by now, especially with two of them dead. So that leads me to believe that #1 can be possible. Is it? We'll likely never know.
           </p>
           <p>
            With all that being said, I don't believe for a minute that all four were replaced. There is no credible evidence, it would be far more difficult to pull off, nor would it explain the clues on the records/artwork. Plus, I don't understand what "state of limbo" means?

             This is why I believe all The Beatles were killed and replaced - they just couldn't risk one of them blowing the whistle if one was killed and replaced. I also can't believe that the other three would keep Paul's death secret if the conspiracy theory is to be believed - you can't be that callous to someone you formed a band with and wrote songs with since you were teenagers.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can imagine fake Beatles who were party to the killing of the real Beatles dropping hints and joking about it though.

            I believe Paul was replaced.  I think there is some good evidence that he died in a car crash and rather than lose their "cash cow", the record label decided to replace him.  The rest of the Beatles went along with it for the money they were promised.  As for the others being replaced, I haven't looked at it so I can't dismiss it entirely, but that seems a bit of a stretch.  I think they were controlled considering that they had gone along with the ruse and they had to toe the line or risk being exposed as engaging in the coverup -- but I haven't seen anything that would make me think that the others were really replaced, too.

             Well in the first interviews after the supposed car crash Faul opened up to taking LSD and later a fake John Lennon would stage his sleep ins with Yoko. Their agenda was quite nuanced - it was to make the anti-war movement unplalatable and ridiculous - effectively derailing it. This was the purpose of hippy culture as laid out by the CIA. The Beatles were calling for peace but in reality were supporting war. Thousands of young American men were sent to their deaths in Vietnam because of this psy-op, so it does matter.

            Paul's replacement sounds so much like him, tho. And the songs.

             Watch some original Beatles concerts and compare them to the fake Beatles. You can see and hear why the fake Beatles stopped doing live performances - they were atrocious.

              I've watched a lot of Beatles footage. You're going to have to be more specific.

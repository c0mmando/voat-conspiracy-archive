<p>Freemasonry in Iran after 1980;</p>
<p>Supposedly Iran had banned freemasonry in 1985 but if you look at Irans parliament, it\'s hard not to notice the freemasonic inspiration for its architecture; </p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8kjnce.jpg">https://files.catbox.moe/8kjnce.jpg</a></p>
<p>Looks like a freemasonic inspired pyramid and on top of that, if you count how many windows there are on the pyramid, you will count up to 33 which is the top masonic number. </p>

</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like inside the parliament, also a triangular shape with illumination in the center</p>
<p>Here is another interesting picture to ponder over; </p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/2p3ffo.png">https://files.catbox.moe/2p3ffo.png</a>  
</p>
<p>This is Irans central bank. There is a blue light that illuminates over the 8 pointed star, creating a triangular shape with the star in the center. To me it gives it a freemasonic look and it also makes the star look similar to the star of david. The 8 pointed star is a star usually used by muslims however historically this star has also been used over the star of david by jews.</p>
<p>In the early to mid 19th century, many synagogues that were built in Europe did not use the six pointed star but the 8 pointed star instead. </p>
<p>Examples would be; Semper Synagogue in Dresden, the Leopoldstädter Tempel in Vienna and the Dohany Street Synagogue in Budapest.

<p>Crypto-Jewry in Iran: </p>
<p>Starting from the 19th century many jews in Iran started to convert on masse to Islam to avoid so called \'persecution\'. </p>
<p>\'\'Friday 30 September 1892, in retaliation for the action the Jewish community had taken against him by complaining to the authorities .While many of the members of the congregation were able to run away in time and find their way home, all of those trapped by the mob were forced to convert to Islam under the threat of death\'\' </p>
<p>\'\'According to Levy , the pressure on the Jews of Hamadān continued until the beginning of 1900. During this period, many converted to Islam, Christianity, and especially the Babi/Bahai religion (see below). Many others emigrated to Tehran\'\' </p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://archive.ph/8zPJf">https://archive.ph/8zPJf</a> </p>
<p>\'\'Many tell with horror the story of how the Jews of Mashhad were forced to convert to Islam</p>
<p>in March 1839, in what is known as the Allahdad incident. Over the years, some felt so threatened that they chose to convert to Islam, but continued to practice Judaism in secret – becoming so-called crypto-Jews. One of the latter, Moshe Hakimi, from Mashhad, spoke to IWPR about this community’s dual identity. “Every newborn was told from his first years of life that we are living in times of crisis andthat they must lead a double life. They told us that we must not talk about our personal lives in front of non-Jewish people. This absolute secrecy became second nature after reaching puberty, he said.\'\'</p>
<p>\'\'Some of these crypto-Jews observed Islamic creeds more zealously than the Muslims\'\' </p>

<p>The Jew Naser Makarem Shirazi. </p>
<p>He has the title of Grand Ayatollah with the Marja authority which is the highest religious title one can recieve within the Shia sect. They are allowed to make legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law for followers and lower-ranking clerics i.e Fatwas. Here is a quote from his wikipedia about his political activity;</p>
<p>\'\'Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi was active in the pre-revolution days, hence he was thrown in jail many times. He was even exiled on three separate occasions to three different locations-Chabahar, Mahabad and Anarak. After the Iranian revolution, he was appointed to the Assembly of Experts for construction and played a major role in writing the first constitution\'\'.. A jew played a major role in writing the first constitution of Iran after the revolution, not suprising..</p>
<p>Habibollah Asgaroladi: </p>
<p>Quotes about him from wikipedia; </p>
<p>\'\'Was a leading senior Iranian politician who was the leader of Islamic Coalition Party, a highly influential conservative political party in Iran\'\' </p>
<p>\'\'He spent many years at the forefront of the Iranian cabinet, serving as both Secretary of State for Social Security, Minister for Economy, Trade and Commerce as well as heading up the Homeland Security Agency and intelligence services in Iran. He ran in the 1981 and 1985 Presidential elections\'\' </p>
<p>He was the Minister of Commerce from 1980 to 1984. He was jewish. His funeral was attendet by the Supreme Leader Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani, Mohsen Rafiqdoost, Ali Larijani and many other senior government officials. This jew was obviously respected by the top Iranian leaders.</p>
<p>Asadollah Asgaroladi: </p>
<p>Brother of Habibollah. He was the wealthiest Iranian inside of Iran before his death in September of last year. </p>
<p>How did he get this rich? Thanks to his brother due to him being an insider as the commerce minister of course; From his wikipedia page</p>
<p>\'\'Asgaroladi increased his wealth dramatically in the 90\'s when there were two official exchange rates for the US dollar. Those with trade license could obtain the lower exchange rate of 1750 rials but the market value of US dollars was at 8000 rials. During this period his brother Habibollah Asgaroladi was the commerce minister responsible for handing out trade licenses to obtain the lower exchange rate. He used his connections to obtain large quantities of US dollars at low exchange rate and resold them at the market value price for a profit of more than 300% \'\' </p>
<p>And this; \'\'According to Forbes Magazine, Asgaroladi was the secret business partner of Swiss-based US-Israeli billionaire and fugitive Marc Rich in helping bypass U.S. sanctions against Iran after the Iranian revolution\'\' </p>
<p>Marc Rich as you most likely already know was a jewish criminal extradoinaire who was also a major Clinton support. Bill Clinton was the one who ended up pardoning him and here you have this Iranian jew being a business partner with Marc Rich. He was allowed to become this rich because of Irans government willing to allow him to plunder the country.</p>
<p>Both Asadollah and Habibollah were close friends of Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, since the 1950s. </p>
<p>more info here; <a href="https://archive.ph/TD415">https://archive.ph/TD415</a> </p>
<p>Saeed Emami. He was the deputy minister in security affairs and the second person of intelligence ministry at the age of only 32! He was accused of having been behind the organization of the assassinations of dissidents aka \'chain murders of Iran\' which is the murder and disappearances of more than 80 Iranian dissident intellectuals who had been critical of Irans islamic government. He was probably one of others who were invovled in these murders and was used to take the main fall. But interesting how Irans government used a jew as a high level intelligence officier that helped them in getting rid of influential critics of Irans government. </p>
<p>I\'m sure there are more prominent cryptos i\'ve missed.</p>
<p>Further red flags; </p>
<p>Here are further interesting articles revealing further red flags about Irans government: </p>
<p>\'\'Ayatollah Khomeini stepped off the plane from Paris, and founded the Islamic Republic\'\' (<a href="https://archive.ph/QXiRZ">https://archive.ph/QXiRZ</a>). Since when did it become that easy to found a new government in one of the most geographically strategic regions in the world? He had to of had the support of the CIA which is why i believe the article by the guardian below is true that the U.S aided Khomeinis take over of Iran.</p>

<p>These Shia militias are more loyal to the leaders of Iran then they are of Iraq: </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/rssgg">https://archive.ph/rssgg</a>   
</p>
<p>Popular Mobilisation Forces are part of the Iraqi army, they recieve ranks and salaries equivalent to other branches of the Iraqi military and as you saw with the above article, one of the largest group within the PMF admit they are more loyal to Irans supreme leader then they are of Iraq. And if we are to believe that Iran at the highest level is under the control of jews then they\'ve used Iran to keep Iraq weak and divided. Iran is actively operating outside its borders and is helping to fuel the Sunni/Shia conflict, keeping Israels enemies divided while also giving the U.S and Israel the excuse needed to bomb countries like Syria, Lebanon and Iran under the guise of halting \'Iranian influence\' which allows Israel to always keep these countries weak for later conquest for their Greater Israel project.</p>',

           The Jew Naser Makarem Shirazi.
          </p>
          <p>
           He has the title of Grand Ayatollah with the Marja authority which is the highest religious title one can recieve within the Shia sect. They are allowed to make legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law for followers and lower-ranking clerics i.e Fatwas. Here is a quote from his wikipedia about his political activity;
          </p>
          <p>
           ''Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi was active in the pre-revolution days, hence he was thrown in jail many times. He was even exiled on three separate occasions to three different locations-Chabahar, Mahabad and Anarak. After the Iranian revolution, he was appointed to the Assembly of Experts for construction and played a major role in writing the first constitution''.. A jew played a major role in writing the first constitution of Iran after the revolution, not suprising..
          </p>
          <p>
           Habibollah Asgaroladi:
          </p>
          <p>
           Quotes about him from wikipedia;
          </p>
          <p>
           ''Was a leading senior Iranian politician who was the leader of Islamic Coalition Party, a highly influential conservative political party in Iran''
          </p>
          <p>
           ''He spent many years at the forefront of the Iranian cabinet, serving as both Secretary of State for Social Security, Minister for Economy, Trade and Commerce as well as heading up the Homeland Security Agency and intelligence services in Iran. He ran in the 1981 and 1985 Presidential elections''
          </p>
          <p>
           He was the Minister of Commerce from 1980 to 1984. He was jewish. His funeral was attendet by the Supreme Leader Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani, Mohsen Rafiqdoost, Ali Larijani and many other senior government officials. This jew was obviously respected by the top Iranian leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
           Asadollah Asgaroladi:
          </p>
          <p>
           Brother of Habibollah. He was the wealthiest Iranian inside of Iran before his death in September of last year.
          </p>
          <p>
           How did he get this rich? Thanks to his brother due to him being an insider as the commerce minister of course; From his wikipedia page
          </p>
          <p>
           ''Asgaroladi increased his wealth dramatically in the 90's when there were two official exchange rates for the US dollar. Those with trade license could obtain the lower exchange rate of 1750 rials but the market value of US dollars was at 8000 rials. During this period his brother Habibollah Asgaroladi was the commerce minister responsible for handing out trade licenses to obtain the lower exchange rate. He used his connections to obtain large quantities of US dollars at low exchange rate and resold them at the market value price for a profit of more than 300% ''
          </p>
          <p>
           And this; ''According to Forbes Magazine, Asgaroladi was the secret business partner of Swiss-based US-Israeli billionaire and fugitive Marc Rich in helping bypass U.S. sanctions against Iran after the Iranian revolution''
          </p>
          <p>
           Marc Rich as you most likely already know was a jewish criminal extradoinaire who was also a major Clinton support. Bill Clinton was the one who ended up pardoning him and here you have this Iranian jew being a business partner with Marc Rich. He was allowed to become this rich because of Irans government willing to allow him to plunder the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both Asadollah and Habibollah were close friends of Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, since the 1950s.

           Saeed Emami. He was the deputy minister in security affairs and the second person of intelligence ministry at the age of only 32! He was accused of having been behind the organization of the assassinations of dissidents aka 'chain murders of Iran' which is the murder and disappearances of more than 80 Iranian dissident intellectuals who had been critical of Irans islamic government. He was probably one of others who were invovled in these murders and was used to take the main fall. But interesting how Irans government used a jew as a high level intelligence officier that helped them in getting rid of influential critics of Irans government.

           Here are further interesting articles revealing further red flags about Irans government:
          </p>
          <p>
           ''Ayatollah Khomeini stepped off the plane from Paris, and founded the Islamic Republic'' (

            https://archive.ph/QXiRZ
           </a>
           ). Since when did it become that easy to found a new government in one of the most geographically strategic regions in the world? He had to of had the support of the CIA which is why i believe the article by the guardian below is true that the U.S aided Khomeinis take over of Iran.

          </p>
          <p>
           These Shia militias are more loyal to the leaders of Iran then they are of Iraq:

          </p>
          <p>
           Popular Mobilisation Forces are part of the Iraqi army, they recieve ranks and salaries equivalent to other branches of the Iraqi military and as you saw with the above article, one of the largest group within the PMF admit they are more loyal to Irans supreme leader then they are of Iraq. And if we are to believe that Iran at the highest level is under the control of jews then they've used Iran to keep Iraq weak and divided. Iran is actively operating outside its borders and is helping to fuel the Sunni/Shia conflict, keeping Israels enemies divided while also giving the U.S and Israel the excuse needed to bomb countries like Syria, Lebanon and Iran under the guise of halting 'Iranian influence' which allows Israel to always keep these countries weak for later conquest for their Greater Israel project.

             Islam is loaded with masonic imagery as is natural with all Abrahamic religions because they all come from jews, the creators and leaders of freemasonry.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example the Hamsa, or the Hand of Fatima is a symbol widely used by Muslims but it is also a symbol big within the Jewish communities specially Kabbalist.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or the Kaaba (Kabbalah) which is a black cube which is basically a Tefillin (the black cube that jews wear on their head) that the Muslims worship, Tefillin is also big within the Kabbalah. Interestingly the cloth (kiswah) that covers the Kaaba was first put there by a jewish king in Arabia, Abu Karib.

              Abraham did not start/found judaism.  Or islam.  Or christianity.
             </p>
             <p>
              Christianity started in the garden of eden.    Judaism started 100+ or so years after Abraham died by his grandson.   And islam, what,

I had lost a lot of my mental faculties: I couldn\'t concentrate, I didn\'t always know what we going on, I would get confused, I had no ideas, I had no interest in anything, nothing seemed to have any means, and I was massively depressed and anxious. I started to plan my suicide.</p>
<p>Then I read a bit in a book that was strangely different from anything I had read before. The author didn\'t seem particularly interested in the conventional classifications of mental health issues and suggested a gluten and casein free diet complete with a nice chart showing improvements accumulating over a year. I tried it. I didn\'t have anything to lose. And to my delight and shock things started to change. The depression lifted. I started having ideas again. I started being able to make connections again. I developed a strange headache that only hurt when I moved my head but a few weeks later that had gone.</p>
<p>That book changed my life forever and opened my eyes to the possibility that diet and digestion might have something to do with my brain problems and I started reading more and more from the the alternative health world. I approached it all with skepticism. Some didn\'t work. But the majority did. Some of the wildest most crazy things I would never have believed worked.</p>
<p>So I started on a big mission to detoxify myself. I learned about how your cognitive functions or cognitive skills (basically how well different parts of your brain work and are able to integrate) is the #1 chief determiner of your success in life (not just career). And how the effects of pollutants and pathogens are affecting peoples emotions and motivations creating an atmosphere of fear, aggression, narrow-mindedness, futility, and complacency.</p>
<p>Why hadn\'t this information been made available to me?</p>
<p>Now I’ve become a brain health spotter. I can see how people all around me are affected by the pollutants and pathogens, how they struggle to overcome their difficulties, and never really make progress. I also see how authorities actively suppress and pay people to disinform about treatments that work.</p>
<p>Waking people up to this is hard but I\'d like to try. I’d like to write in a way that assumes the reader is able to see sense and encourage people to run their own tests to confirm or refute my claims. I\'d also like to write in a way that is sympathetic and optimistic and ask nothing in return other than to share the message with other people. Most of all I want to be able to demonstrate the connection between success and health for those people like myself who have lost many years (decades in my case) trying to achieve things by pushing themselves and approaching tasks from different angles but never really moving forward. I\'d also like to approach detoxification and health restoration from a perspective of committed self-love rather than self-loathing.</p>
<p>I\'m sure many more principles for how to make this a good resource will occur to me as we start to work on it. It doesn\'t have to be amazing from day one but I want to start the process and I don\'t want to do it alone. I recognize that the provision of reliable health information capable of having a transformative effect is very challenging so we could start by focusing on the bigger issues and I honestly believe the core principles of achieving good health are relatively consistent among people: improve nutrition, remove allergens, kill infections, excrete toxicities, and rebuild systems.</p>
<p>So if you think this is something you would be interested in please send me a PM. If you know someone who you think might be interested in this please share a link to this page with them.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you and best of health to you all!</p>',

             Well, it's a very ambitious task and I'd really prefer not to slave away all on my lonesome doing it. That's just a personal preference really because I also want to use this as an opportunity to connect with some likeminded folk. Also my brain has its limitations and some support would be useful.

            I like you.

           <p>
            Understand there will be much negativity thrown at you by those still stuck in what they were taught in school and by their parents based on false assumptions and outright lies.
           </p>

            Persevere.

            Start putting the collection together, make sure it's backed up on separate servers.  I was affected by a brilliant dietician and chiropractor, who turned me on to Terry Wahls.

            We as a people have dug ourselves into a dark hole nutritionally, but there is a growing surge of those finding out there is a better way and thriving from it.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are others, they may be hesitant to share their story because even though it worked they have suffered ridicule.

             Thanks. This is a project I'm going to do no matter what and I'm certainly prepared for the negativity. In a way I quite like to be criticized because it keeps you on your toes but then you have to ignore a lot of it too.

             Optimal Nutrition for the Mind by Patrick Holford. Although my favorite health books are Hulda Clark's even though they are super super dense. That woman is my idol.

             One of the things I'm interested in doing is trying to represent some of the information presented in prose into consistent data structures or diagrams. Then you can be taught about principles and browse the data to learn interesting things rather than have to take in loads of disparate facts.

             There are definitely things I like things about Natural News and it is a great resource but I don't really like the attitude overall. Also it is far too political. I really want to focus on health and providing good quality reliable information. That doesn't mean I'm going to shy away from controversy however.

              Ok. They do cover a lot more than only health. I linked it because I consider the stuff they have on health to be of good quality.

              I wish you success in your endeavor.

            That sounds like an interesting idea! I have asthma, and the most that my doctor did was prescribe me over-the-counter allergy meds and an inhaler.

<p>This comes straight off the back of being exposed for funding the Ferguson protestors with $33 million over a period of a year and during the riots they had there. And a short while before that it also transpired that Soros\' was funding feminist sextremist group Femen ( their words not mine ). I read he has also allegedly  had a role in Ukraine too, financing the political careers of the people who have now become the leading politicians in Ukraine, since at least 2008.</p>
<p>I know George Soros\' foundation was set up to help aid social injustices, which is all good in the spirit of philanthropy and all, but it just seems that wherever the money goes the trouble flows. Trouble in Ukraine, Ferguson protestors demanding they haven\'t been paid yet and want their money, and strangely enough although he was willing to fund Femen, he suddenly dropped funding when they announced they was to open a branch of Femen in Isreal, fancy that.</p>
<p>I was just wondering what your views are on this, or if you know of any other groups George has been kindly funding that have been causing a bit of social unrest lately?</p>',

             I did notice in the leaked document that he was trying to get Ukraine to arm up, and the article said this is just one month after a ceasefire was signed. I hope more people continue to get exposed like this.

            Soros' purpose is to keep society divided, and thus easier to rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google the ancient political strategy of "Divide and Rule".  Romans used it in Judea.  Britain used it most everywhere on earth.  Oligarchs use it today.

             There was a time when all shady deals where done with wads of cash in brown envelopes or briefcases and kept hush hush, it's sickening that he can do all this so openly using his foundation as a front. I imagine he gets a big fat tax cut for his "charitable" deeds as well.

            George Soros is a bastard. The fact that his philanthropic foundation is nothing more than a front to funnel money for nefarious purposes is no surprise.

             Pretty much what my thoughts where on the man too, I was just trying to be polite about it seeing as I'm new around here. I came across something about the leaked papers yesterday, no doubt it will be kept quite from the big media and swept under the rug.

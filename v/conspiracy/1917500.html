<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I\'ve researched a bunch, unconnected to political scandal, about Divine Numerology in every religion, from Christianity, to Tarot, to the ancient Egyptians and Sumerians. I am by no means an expert, just an experienced dot-connector and have an insatiable curiosity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some things I found: significant political events happen in cycles, most correlating to the number seven. Drudging through the Wikileaks archives, I came across a connection between the Fed and their money cycles, which happen to mostly be in multiples of seven. These cycles are in number of days: 1, 7, 13, 272, 294, 321, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77. Now I\'m not sure of a direct connection between the Fed and Global false flags, but these cycles don\'t make a lot of logical sense in terms of historical numbers data. It just so happens that the Bay of Pigs incident occurred 56 solar years prior to the Boston Marathon bombing, just as one blatant example. I\'ve also researched on the day-placement within one year, x event happened with 321 days left in the current year, y event happened 63 days into the year, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rummaging through Wikileaks regarding responses to a new Marketing Writer position at Stratfor, a writing sample sent in from an applicant named Esteban Hinojosa goes into depth about numerology, the heavens, and historic events cycles. A forwarded email between two Stratfor employees explicates that &quot;he cracked your code!&quot; Which trips the alarm for me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through my own research and digging through Stratfor and Kissinger (commonly referred to as Cissinger in the emails, which I found pretty peculiar) cables, I found that Sevens means confusion, and sixes means chastiment, which brings a whole new meaning to the common phrase &quot;all sixes and sevens&quot; which referred to someone caught in rut due to confusion. A communication in the Kissinger emails reveals a &quot;double sevens&quot; day on July 7, 1977 in Jamaica. The Jamaican leader and his operatives believed in a Rastafarian prophecy about the day in which &quot;the head of Mansley will roll&quot; and Jamaican officials were concerned and on high alert. The email chain reveals that the opposition forces took extra precaution to ensure that the prophecy did not come to fruition on the &quot;double sevens&quot; day. There are also many references to &quot;twos&quot; and &quot;eights&quot; cycles, and the pluralized numbers are frequently referred to as factions of NATO (The Nines = EC-9, a NATO committee chaired by France, for example) but many of these are left unexplained, leading to an inner circle code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven\'t sat down and timelined event cycles quite yet, it is a bit tedious. I also wonder how far we can get in revealing the meanings or definitions of each cycle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to recap, sixes mean chastisement and sevens means confusion (maybe deception as well). 6 x 7 = 56. 56 days between Bay of Pigs and Boston Bombing. What other cycles and connections can we predict so we are not caught off guard by the next elitist hunger games?</p>

<p>Dan Hett is a confident public speaker. He would be capable of dealing with media and following a script.

<p>Dan Hett follows the narrative of attacking right wing views against Islam and Muslims. He recently tweeted in response to Katie Hopkins giving talks in schools by saying he would give the children &quot;the real effect of extremism&quot;.

<p>Dan and Martyn Hett\'s mother gave a bizarre interview where she showed no emotion and even joked about Martyn dying as being typical of the attention seeker.

She obtained 11 A* GCSEs while dealing with the trauma of losing her brother in such a violent, premeditated fashion.</p>
<p>Dan Hett on Twitter talks about meeting with Brendan Cox, husband of slain MP Jo Cox, and having exciting plans. On the surface the only thing these two people have in common is their dislike of criticism of Muslims. Was this meeting a chance for them to discuss their part in these false flags?

<p>Dan Hett has had an RFID chip implanted into his hand. Is this because he\'s bought and paid for, now under surveillance to ensure he sticks to his role?

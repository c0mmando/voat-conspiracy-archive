<p>This conspiracy doesn\'t just involve one pizza parlor in Washington DC. No it affects pizza parlors all over the world, even your local ma &amp; pa pizza parlor might be in on it. Besides from running pedo rings, these parlors are involved in another wicked plot.</p>
<p>You know how after you eat lots of pizza, you get acne. And when you eat even more pizza, those zits become pepperoni shaped. And your skin becomes cheese.

<p>&quot;How can this happen&quot; is a question that anyone reading this might ask. I do not the exact science behind it, so I\'ll give you a simplified rundown. This because the pizza contains a mixture of GMOs, grease, and a mysterious chemical that pizza parlors use called Chemical X. Chemical X has the ability to change a person\'s DNA with the DNA of the food that they are currently ingesting, as well as giving the mind pedophile thoughts.</p>
<p>When a person has become a Pizzaoid, Madame Tussaud\'s will ship them a plastic skin which will replicate their former human skin. Notable Pizzaoids are Guy Fieri, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Queen Elizabeth, and even &quot;Papa John&quot; Schnatter himself.</p>
<p>Please stay away from Papa John\'s, Little Ceaser\'s, Domino\'s, and Pizza Hut because their pizzas contain Chemical X. However, Happy Joe\'s and Papa Murphy\'s are fine.</p>

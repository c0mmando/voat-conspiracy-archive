The movie \'GasLight\' 1944 shows an innocent woman is made to think she is crazy because of hysterical thinking and manic behaviour of the husband.</p>
<pre><code>Hysteria was a common diagnoses for women to get but started to decrease in the 1900\'s up until 1980 (when it was done away with entirely) which around 1980 many types of mental Illnesse exploded into what we have today. This is what wiki has to say &quot;Hysteria is no longer thought of as a real ailment&quot;, if you look up \'the Dancing plague of 1518\' then you\'ll know hysteria is a very real and dangerous thing and that case started with a single unchecked woman. Also looking up Bi polar you will see that it wasn\'t a thing until 1957 (maybe as early as 1911 but it wasn\'t taught until 1957) then in the 1970\'s bi-polar 2 and rapid cycling were added. Mania is often referred to bi polar in the term \'Manic-depressive\' but mania has been a real phsycological disorder for a long time and is more related to hysteria than depression. In the 1800\'s mania was defined as \'moral insanity\' (link because wiki does not include anything this far back [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539549/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539549/) ) by the current definition of mania a person who is too happy or too ambitious has mania which is not how it was defined prior to the 1900\'s (the definition of the word started to change as early as 1971 from what I found). The term \'maniac\' as we all know refers to people like The Joker from bat man.
</code></pre>

<p>Saying hysteria doesn\'t exist is like saying snakes don\'t exist and when someone gets sick or dies from a snake bite it would be said it\'s because of \'genetic illness\' followed by prescribing genetic altering drugs instead of finding the snake to make anti venom...</p>
<p>Now lets look at this and ask ourselves &quot;who has the most to gain by eliminating and confusing the words hysteria and mania&quot;?</p>
<p>Hysteria is pretty simple women have the most to gain as they were the most common to be diagnosed with it.</p>
<p>Mania might be a bit more difficult but marking someone who is too ambitious as crazy helps keep those in power from being threated by other people\'s ambition (example, Tucker, Tesla, Hughes and Musk), making sure that people are never too happy makes them easier to control... and from what we see today easier to get addicted to social media and video games, this could also be associated to the rise in drug addictions which of course is why weed is so illegal because they want you to be addicted to their drugs not something that most anyone can grow in their back yard or closet. If you can grow tomatoes you can grow weed, other drugs take special chemicals or knowledge to know how to make.</p>',

            I was fucking lucky I'm headstrong as fuck. A lesser man going through what I've been through ends up abusing people themselves, abusing substances, hating the world, or ending up in jail or worse.

            I got angry. REAL angry, but never once did I go down the role of self hate or pity.

            Bipolar is the most Overdiagnosed mental disorder.  Less than 1 out of a 100 people who are "bipolar" ever met criteria for diagnosis.
            <a href="https://images.slideplayer.com/26/8278873/slides/slide_4.jpg">
             IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD MANIA, YOU ARE NOT BIPOLAR
            </a>
            (which is 99 out of a 100 bipolar diagnosed people).  Forget with the rapid cycler bullshit, these people just
            <em>
             want
            </em>
            to have this diagnosis.  "Manic depressive" is like Judeo-Christian, opposites.   Just because you are miserable, then have a "good day", or fluxuate between happy and sad in the same day, doesn't mean you are bipolar.  You are bipolar ONLY if you have ever been clinically
            <em>
             euphoric
            </em>
            , and not cared about the consequences, made wreckless risky decisions not thinking about tomorrow, etc. etc.
            <em>
             Not
            </em>
            that you stocked up a little heavy on your prepping, or bought that car or clothes you've been thinking about.    This "disorder" should be thought of like ADHD, that the science and diagnosis and is questionable at best, when diagnosed it's often innacurate, and the treatments may be more problematic than the symptoms.

             By the definition of today yes because I spent an hour and a half looking up information and putting together this post. What does this post do but inform the uninformed and stand against those who misinform and silence history?

              I don't think you are insane. I just picked up the manic vibe.

              When you are manic, think edit, edit, edit.

              When you are depressed, think express, express, express.

            Of course alien life exists....somewhere.   It is mathematically improbable to say that there are no other forms of life anywhere.  If you watch the video and listen to the description it sounds like Obama knew that Jaden wanted to ask him (no doubt every room in the white house is bugged).  He jumped in before Jaden could even ask and neither confirmed nor denied it leaving the possibility open for a young hopefully child instead of crushing innocence he played on it an made a child happy.  Also that quote in the title isn't said.

              That's pretty interesting. My mind goes to a rational possibility by default, that being that these "ufo files" are just unidentified military aircraft that they want to keep secret for reasons. However I haven't researched the topic of cover ups very much, so I can't really say one way or the other, I just keep an open mind &amp; try not to lean on one side too hard. I don't doubt the existence of potential cover ups though, my main point was that that this particular video isn't a good example of alien existence, imo.
             </p>
             <p>
              I do believe in aliens though, just the sheer probability given the number of galaxies &amp; the vastness of the universe, there has to be someone else out there. As for whether they've visited earth or not is up for debate though.

                Ok I read it &amp; have a few questions/observations. Do you know the name of the guy who wrote that report? (The points mentioning all the parts about the dangers of engaging with the flying saucer etc) I'd like to know more about what kind of character this guy is &amp; what his motivations may be, I know they say he's a guy with several degrees but that doesn't exonerate him from potentially being mentally ill/biased/insert reason here. It seems to me that the FBI made this report because they thought it was in the public interest just in case something like this were to happen?
               </p>
               <p>
                One point that makes me not think they have visited  (at least not in recent years) is that most people in developed countries have a video camera on them at all times, so where are all the videos of UFO's? I know it sounds overly simplistic but I think it raises a good point.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I'd like to know your take on that FBI release, I'm curious as to your thinking &amp; rationale.

                 First, I will never believe in aliens until I see one face to face. I just think all this stuff is very interesting/entertaining in a sci-fi way. That being said...

                 There are literally thousands of UFO videos that comes out every year. Last year there was a mass sighting in Houston. Hundreds of people blew up twitter. There were multiple pictures, vids, and eyewitness accounts from tons of people that didn't know each other. Info here:

                </p>
                <p>
                 Go on youtube and type "UFO sightings 2015". It's usually all floating orbs of light but there are hundreds of them a month. The UFO phenomenon is real, it just may have an explanation that doesn't involve aliens. Lockheed Martin is a much better explanation imho.

If so what what already? I will show here- By drawing dot by dot and over lines I show there may be white dots but that these images are more about human tissue and body parts and fantasy realms with kings and horses and architural shapes as in houses more than a natural picture of space. Is this a conspiracy worthy post? I think so because everybody wonders what is nasa up to? People wonder Did we really go to the moon or was that just a video. Now i ask nasa why the fake pictures of Stars? In this article NASA do admit to these hubble images having &quot;overlying&quot; older images from over time at Hubble. But actually what they are doing is a style of photography pioneered (secretly) by Maxfield Parish where layers on layers of photographic imagery is placed strategically over each to hide other images in plain sight. The scale of the hidden images will be 50% tinier say than the front image, then another scale of 75% and the whole surface will be covered with yet another image, and then on a scale of 15% just for example, for yet another whole new surface of dynamic action layered apon what\'s already been layered. Then Maxfield called  it a &quot;painting&quot;. That\'s how it works. The rule in finding these hidden images and countering measurent scales imagery, is that in nature no three lines appear together. So when there are three equal lines there is a problem. That\'s where I start to draw. There is a story to tell in every hubble image and the first story in these images has crucifiction, a human form holding the beheaded head of a king. Btw, that was fucking clever of them! the way they hid that, and i would never have found (seen) the kings broken crown without using the rule about three equal lines do not make a natural picture. It was only as I followed along the lines that i drew out (just a little) some imagery that is so obviously handiwork of man. </p>
<p>These images are from the first pages of the article so I show the before I drew on it and after I drew on it, so you know my source is the magazine itself. No need for higher resolution it\'s pretty clear. Just use your eyes, even with out my drawing.

<p>This centerfold is into the article a couple pages. Think - medical industry photographic images of blood,eyeballs,lips, fleshless tissue and you will see that. Also there is a story to tell in these pictures. I don\'t know what that\'s about, I haven\'t studied the story. But I know FAKE imagery, these are just a couple examples, it takes me a few hours to draw stuff out and I don\'t wanna distract my energies from another project right now so I leave you guys with this, hope to hear what you have to say about this. Is it mind control? What conspiracy does this fall into anyway, flat earth? Not sure why space pictures need to be fake now too. </p>

             TRuth.from conspiarcy foum no less. By the way. Thoughts Ie. yours, are not truths, they are not a matter of truth. They are thoughts. You may be incapable of using your own eyes not your thoughts, that's all.  This  article admits  the photos are piece meal work. The hidden imagery is obvious. Why not examine my claim the whole imagery are fake. Because I am claiming they are? How else can a person  make claim on voat conspiracy that there is fake news without the post of the claim being deleted. The proof is in the plain sight. 
Your comment to get psychiatric help immediately is more like a nasty insult. Smacked with hate. 
Why dont u go to the dr  and get a big shot of thorazine in your upper arm? 
You: No, Im not schizo.
             <br/>
             Dr: But sir, you think you are a psychologist.

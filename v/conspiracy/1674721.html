            There are good aspects to the ideas of Globalism. Is this one of them? Cooperation between Nations in an open, transparent manner?
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you share any more insight with us about this? What turned you on to the idea that this is a bad agency? Any recognizable baddies connected to this we should be aware of?
           </p>

            I mean if you could tell us that George Soros was involved somehow it would be raining Karma for you.

             I am all for positive global relations, global trade, etc.  But I prefer this country to remain a sovereign nation - with a government run "by the people for the people."  There is no reason we need a Civil Society-related group working WITHIN our government.  It erodes our independence and poses a risk to our national security.
            </p>
            <p>
             Soros' Open Society looks very different in actuality than it does on paper.  Civil Society is the same - its ideology parallels open society, and there is a lot of overlap of the organizations they sponsor.  So, I guess it's raining Karma because Soros sponsors some CS organizations, and Omidyar sponsors some OS organizations, and both societys work cooperatively to further the same agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             CS may actually be more dangerous than OS.  I'm beginning to wonder if  Soros is purposefully "the front man," drawing so much attention that the more covert actions of Omidyar go unnoticed.   I had NO idea the OGP existed - and my guess is most people don't. Most Americans would NOT be happy.  I was researching some things in the 2016 primary election  and saw the lengths CS went to get Clinton elected - Why bad?   Because they do the opposite of what they supposedly  uphold.  For example, freedom of speech - they say people shouldn't be censored, yet froze/yanked Paypal accounts of people who disagree with them.  Look what they've through the media.  Like Soros, they will use force, Ukraine for ex, was invaded by USAid troops funded by Omidyar when Ukraine wasn't following  CS rules.  CS/OGP says it protects whistleblowers - yet we have seen an increase in retaliation against whistleblowers.  Both societies say they're anti-corruption, yet they are PART of the corruption.  If you don't want Soros running the govt (which he does) then you don't want CS running it (they are.)   Evil committed under the guise of philanthropy is a very insidious evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OGP is nothing more than a vehicle for "society" to move us into global governance-  - and we're doing their work for them!  They have got to be laughing all the way to the World Bank (which, incidentally, is one of their partners.)
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't like saying these things.  I wish that I didn't have this opinion and could be at peace with it all.  But I don't, and I'm not, and I'm tired of watching millions of people harmed because a few pathologically arrogant people believe they not only know what is best for the rest of us but, in doing so, view us as expendable objects undeserving of individuality and free will.

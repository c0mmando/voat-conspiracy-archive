            Sure!  You're the one suggesting lighting a firecracker next to your head every day wouldn't cause long term health effects.  But whatever.  Take a swing at my dick, I bet you wouldn't know where to punch seeing how far up your ass your head currently is.

            I guess my argument was a little convoluted.  I was trying to point out irrational standards of risk perception.  UV: proved dangerous (although only after years and years of heavy exposure), minimal concern.  Microwave radiation: no clear evidence of danger, high level of concern.  In retrospect it's a strawman.  However, my assertion that microwave radiation is safe still stands.

            The WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Classification has specified that Cell Phones are carcinogenic, causing a 10 fold increase in Glial cancer with 20 minutes of use per day for 10 years. Do you fall into that category?

            Lots of people visit the areas this has been taking place in. It's the state capital ffs! They have plenty of areas to test this shit, out in away from people. Nevada on their bases for one, Mojave for another. I guess that's not their aim. Ugh this disgusts me. The PNW is my home. It's bad enough we have a super fund site out east leaking radiation, now this. Great.

                Among Polish soldiers (128 thousand personnel subjects aged from 20 to 59 years), soldiers of 20—29 years old exposed to radar microwaves during 1970—1979 had cancer incidence rates 5.5 folds higher than non-exposed soldiers [16]. The greatest rise of cancer cases was detected in blood-forming organs and lymphatic tissues: by 13.9 folds for chronic myelocytic leukemia and 8.6 folds for myeloblastic leukemia. The level of mortality among all exposed personnel was significantly higher than in unexposed: for colorectal cancer (observed-expected ratio, OER 3.2; 95 %), for cancer of esophagus and stomach (OER 3.2; 95 %), cancer of blood-forming system and lymphatic tissues (OER 6.3; 95 %) [17].

               <p>
                A very substantial increase in cancer incidence was also detected in commercial airline pilots. Thus, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for malignant melanoma cases was 10.2; 95.5 % for pilots of commercial airlines in Iceland [19]. Significantly increased risks of acute myeloid leukemia (SIR 5.1), skin cancer, excluding melanoma (SIR 3.0) and total cancer (SIR 1.2) were observed also among Danish male jet pilots [20]. These data have been explained as a result of excess cosmic ionizing radiation or even excessive sun radiation during a leisure time. However, analysis of brain cancers among US Air Force personnel has revealed that non-ionizing radiation and particularly MW had significant effect on cancer development (odds ratio, OR 1.38; 95%), whereas ionizing radiation had negative association with cancer cases (OR 0.58; 95 %) [21]. To that, standardizing mortality ratio (SMR) for brain tumors was 2.1; 95 % among German male cockpit crew members (6,017 people) [22]. Cancer risk was significantly raised (risk ratio 2.2; 95%) among cockpit crew members employed for 30 years as compared to those employed for less than 10 years. In addition, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) was also increased (SMR 4.2; 95%) among male cabin crew members (20,757 people). Importantly, any increase in cancers associated with ionizing (cosmic) radiation was not detected in this cohort study.

Occupational use of hand-held radar was the only shared risk factor among all six officers, and all had a routine habit of keeping the radar gun directly in close proximity to their testicles. Similarly, in Ontario, Canada risk assessment among police officers exposed to radar devices for speed measurement (1,596 females and 20,601 males) revealed an increased risk among men for testicular cancer (SIR 1.3) and for melanoma (SIR 1.45; 95 %) [24].

              Because I understand how it works.  Microwave energy excites water molecules.  That's it.  If it excites the water molecules in my body, my temperature will increase slightly.  Too little for me to notice.  Ultraviolet radiation is actually dangerous - there are numerous studies that show this.  Are you afraid of sunlight?

               Doesn't matter who you are, microwave energy causes frictional heating on a subatomic level.  Microwaves tuned to 2.4 GHz interact with water the most.  Hence why it is used to heat food.  GSM Base towers literally have the entire microwave spectrum to use, but have also chosen 2.4 GHz, why?  To microwave the people, thats why.

                  cell phone users have no increased risk of the most common forms of brain tumors -- glioma and meningioma. In addition, the study revealed no evidence of increasing risk with progressively increasing number of calls, longer call time, or years since beginning cell phone use.

                 For the small proportion of study participants who reported spending the most total time on cell phone calls, there was some increased risk of glioma, but the researchers considered this finding inconclusive. Furthermore, a large population-based cohort study in Denmark has found no evidence of increased risk of brain tumors. It is noteworthy that brain cancer incidence and mortality rates in the population have changed little in the past decade.

The international pooled analysis of data gathered from 13 participating countries found no increased risk of glioma or meningioma with mobile phone use of more than 10 years. There are some indications of an increased risk of glioma for those who reported the highest 10% of cumulative hours of cell phone use, although there was no consistent trend of increasing risk with greater duration of use. The researchers concluded that biases and errors limit the strength of these conclusions and prevent a causal interpretation.

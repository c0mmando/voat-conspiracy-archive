            The moon most likely was faked on the first landing as a propaganda stunt to beat the Russians, but subsequent missions most likely went there.

            American Sniper was the worst. I got a lot of shit on Facebook for bringing up what a liar the dude was. I watched the one scene where his dad talks about people being sheep, sheep dog or wolves and lost it. Couldn't stop laughing.

            I will definitely watch those two videos because I'm always open to new information. I guess my main question is that if they are doing something nefarious, aren't they doing it to themselves as well? Whoever "they" are, I guess. It just seems like it wouldn't benefit anyone if everyone is getting sprayed.

            Oh man, great response. I'm 25 and was in 6th grade when 9/11 happened. My mom voted for Bush in 2000 and somewhere between his first and second term, she went from Bushco-loving, Limbaugh-listening good Christian lady to total hippie, 9/11 conspiracy theorist, agnostic rebel gardener. It is the best thing that ever happened to me as a kid and I thank god she stumbled upon Truth Out one day. So I ended up hopping on the 9/11 train very early around 2003 or so. I was in HS wearing conspiracy shirts and talking about revolution. I kind of almost miss how radical I was in HS and how new everything was after 9/11 (if that makes sense). Now I just feel jaded about this shitty war machine and the million other connected problems, much less passionate although I feel it coming back.

            I
            <em>
             just
            </em>
            posted a new submission about vaccines and I am fucking dying for people to watch it. I think it's the best video I've seen so far on vaccinations and the person doesn't mention autism once. This video has changed my life. I grew up unvaccinated but lately have been feeling the fear so I started doing research again. I'd love to know your thoughts!

            I go back and forth about the moon landing. It's one of those I really can't reach a decision on. I do, however, find the chemtrails conspiracy embarrassing.

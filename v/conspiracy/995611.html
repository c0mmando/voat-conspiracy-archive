            We are the dwellers of the cave, forced to interpret reality in our dimension of perception by the limitations of being a resident of that dimension. We can observe the shadows of the other dimensions but to understand we would have to be able to grasp something beyond anything we have ever tried to understand before, but it may be far simpler than we can yet imagine.

            I've been worried about a new FF for a few weeks now. Its just been too damn quiet. They seem to choose long stretches of peace for these attacks to maximize psychological impact.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the "fake news" thing is a faux flourish. Sure they'd probably like it to catch on, but I think they're banking on something happening that is so big, we forget about everything for a while after. They just need to keep a place holder long enough to still be relivant when this event comes down.
           </p>
           <p>
            My worst fear is some sort of attack that takes the physical internet infrastructure down, but leaves the rest of our gird functioning. The chaos would be limited, and highly controllable, plus it would cement the MSM as "the ones that were there when it mattered."

            What if the false flag is ALIENS living on Antarctica!  Think that would distract us enough?  Crazy shit.  I know.  But worth the read.

            With Hillary Clinton making a public statement about it just recently, you can count on that happening. It's all part of the PRS (Problem, Reaction, Solution) methodology that TPTB routinely use to condition people into believing their narratives.

           Before reading it I'd assumed the article was something about manipulating people to radicalize them and turn them into killers.  Well, I'm not surprised; that's something militaries around the world have been methodizing for years.  Stick the bayonet into the training dummy, shoot the silhouette.

           Militaries would therefore be interested in research that would help perfect the process, and make soldiers who were essentially pre-blooded, who wouldn't hesitate to fire on the enemy.  Research dollars spent on psychological and psychopharamaceutical research, to make soldiers see attackers as non-human.

           Did they achieve the goal?  Do they have a method for quickly producing an ideal army?
          </p>
          <p>
           Further, would this research be applicable to other "problems"?  Say, turning people into walking "bombs", ready to create incidents?
          </p>
          <p>
           And let me take this a step further.  Look at what's happening with Antifa, dehumanizing the "Nazis".  Are these techniques being subtly practiced on the public in general?

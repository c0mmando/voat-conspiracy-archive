            I thought he was murdered before I saw the video of his supposedly bereft family. It's just another badly acted scene with his parents being buffoons and his "brother" smiling. Doesn't have the appearance or texture of real life at all. His death was just another staged tv episode.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another problem I have with it is that the fact that he was brought into a hospital and swarmed by law enforcement officers who stopped anyone from treating him so that he died from his wounds -- according to the report of an anonymous 4th year medical resident at that hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            But anyone who leaked that kind of information about a patient would have lost their residency, and the entire story is unbelievable if you know how a hospital works.

             Seth Rich was never pronounced dead at the hospital and had no autopsy, the former CIA op claims Seth Rich was a Mossad agent giving Trump a gift by releasing those emails from the DNC then “disappearing” back to Israel, that’s why the Rich family who are Israeli citizens don’t want his death to be investigated."

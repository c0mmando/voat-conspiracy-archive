<p>	There are two(technically 3) strains of the Corona Virus. The initial(first) strain has been present for quite a long time and a significant percentage of the population in both the West and China has been exposed to it. And many people were already exposed by/during the late Fall of 2019. It is asymptomatic in many cases, but in those who show symptoms it presents similar to a flu bug. That is to say fatigue, aches, potentially a stuffy/runny nose or cough, and in some cases a mild fever (rarely a high fever). With proper rest and nutrition it (like a typical flu bug) typically resolves in 1-2 weeks from onset of symptoms. Most people have already been exposed to this strain and many over the course of the last decade. This is why the Gates Foundation was so concerned about a potential outbreak. While itself not particularly dangerous, it presented an albeit quite unlikely potential to mutate into a very serious virus, which would not have cross-immunity with its origin strain.</p>
<p>	The second strain was not in existence until sometime in the late fall of 2019. It was created by a mutation of the initial strain. This mutation was done using a quantum tunneling technology (Core o na for those in the know) combined with the 5G infrastructure in Wuhan. It was an intentional mutation into a very deadly form of the virus. It was mutated in people who already had the initial strain and they overnight became vectors for the virus (which has an atypically long incubation period). It was done in Wuhan because it provided an excellent cover (being the location of China\'s only level 4 bio-safety lab). Additionally, it was where the international war games were held. This served as a convenient albatross to pin the blame on a foreign entity. The reality is that it was the same old Nazis/Sabbatean-Frankists/Cutthroat Commies as usual. The technology they used to mutate the virus has since been dealt with and is no longer itself a threat. The Chinese are dramatically underplaying the extent of the devastation in Wuhan and surrounding areas and while I cannot provide an accurate estimate of the death toll, it is likely at least a few orders of magnitude greater than what is officially claimed. The reasons it hit Italy and Iran as hard as it did is because they had a large number of incoming Chinese nationals traveling from China during this period. Italy (particularly Northern Italy where the virus has hit the hardest) has a large number of Chinese migrant laborers as well as more generally being an obvious winter time tourist destination. Iran also had large numbers of Chinese tourists during this time frame. If you examine the treatment data you will see that there is a dramatic distinction between treatments being applied. In some cases a typical routine of rest/nutrition/isolation and in others a very extreme treatment using steroids. The mortality rate among medical professionals is also extremely high in Italy and Iran as a direct result of this. They are being exposed to the rarer and much more lethal virus at a much higher rate than anyone else. The third strain is far more contagious than the second, but this is of little consequence to medical professionals who spend so much time in close proximity to the infected.</p>
<p>	The third strain is actually an attempt at mass vaccination with cross immunity to the second strain. You need only examine the Diamond princess cruise ship to realize that they were milling this strain of the virus intentionally (As was claimed by a Japanese medical expert). This strain is far less severe, presenting symptoms far more regularly than the initial strain, but in much the same severity(relatively mild). This third strain is also highly contagious and can be transmitted for extended periods of time on surfaces as well as through the air at significant distance.  They are currently attempting to expose as many people as possible to this third strain. The quarantine exists to protect the immuno-compromised and elderly from this third strain (it\'s not can\'d y after all), but also is done with the knowledge that the third strain (being so contagious) will nonetheless spread among the healthy people still out and about. The 2nd strain as of now has only popped up in Italy, Iran, and New York. New York was well on the way to herd immunity via the third strain when the 2nd strain began to show up. </p>

            Do you have that post from 4chan from last October?  I have been looking for it.  I think it was on pol and someone was posting that the coronavirus was loose in Canada and that we had better watch out.

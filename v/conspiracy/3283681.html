            Why should we believe an FBI agent who claims Russian bots were in a thread - maybe there were, but maybe he used the allegations to smear some anons.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what exactly were the alleged Â´Russian bots' posting?

             The issue is not if we should believe him, the issue is why he was there to begin with. He wanted people to "dig" on something, which is damning because it also confirms that they crowdsource research on the chans. This was alleged by the chans for a while now, and explains why so many misinformation campaigns seem successful.
            </p>
            <p>
             I suspect that he wanted people to "dig" to clear out the thread and to limit the posters. They were looking for someone/some group of people in particular.
            </p>
            <p>
             The level of incompetence that was demonstrated is just astonishing. Printing out, then scanning, sceenshots of their own posts? Exposing their submissions and what they said on the thread in the process? Even better if you take the misspellings and slangs, you can figure out that agents other posts on the site.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tl/dr: we should not believe them because they are stupid. The question is why were they there? Was this normal glow in the dark monkeyshines, or was there something else going on?

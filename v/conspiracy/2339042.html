            Taken from Wikipedia;
In March 2001, Mezvinsky was indicted and later pleaded guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of bank fraud, mail fraud, and wire fraud.[13] Nearly $10 million was involved in the crimes. Shortly after his indictment, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but the judge at his trial disallowed a mental illness defense.[5] He entered prison in February 2003, and served his time at Federal Prison Camp, Eglin.[14] Marjorie Margolies requested a pardon for Mezvinsky in the waning days of the Clinton administration but it was not acted upon. Mezvinsky, Federal Bureau of Prisons # 55040-066, was released in April 2008, after 5 years. He remained on federal probation until 2011, and as of 2010 still owed $9.4 million in restitution to his victims.

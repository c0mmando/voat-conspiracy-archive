<p>Students found dead</p>
<p>At approximately 12:45 a.m. Monday night two Columbine High School students -- Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16 -- were found dead inside a Subway sandwich store located less than a mile from the school. Both suffered fatal gunshot wounds. Hart, at the time, was believed to have been visiting Kunselman, a Subway employee. The suspect is described as being &quot;a white male in his teens or early 20s who was wearing a red jacket and flared pants.&quot; He was seen near the shopping center about the time the bodies were discovered. A surveillance camera was present inside the shop, though appears to have been turned off. Click for The Washington Post and The Denver Post stories.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, The Denver Rocky Mountain News reports <a href="http://www.insidedenver.com/shooting/0215col0.shtml">http://www.insidedenver.com/shooting/0215col0.shtml</a> that cash was left in the register inside the store. The store was noted as an unlikely target for a robbery since large currency is placed in a locked safe throughout the day. &quot;It\'s not worth robbing, 50 bucks, maybe,&quot; said employee J.J. Hodack. The shooting appears to have taken place sometime between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. A witness, present in the store at 10 p.m., reports that all was normal when the store closed. An employee, driving by the shop at around 1 a.m., noticed the lights were unusually on inside. The bodies were then found behind the counter inside the shop.</p>',

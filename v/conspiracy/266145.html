What is gang stalking and electronic harassment?
Gang stalking is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form.
Electronic Harassment is when someone uses any electronic device to aid them in invading your person or property for the purpose of gathering information illegally, or for the purpose of causing harm. Electronic Harassment comes in many forms and types. It can be used for surveillance, sabotage, interference, directed energy weapons, etc.</p>
<p>Organized stalking is probably a better term than “gang stalking” since it more accurately conveys the systematic nature of the crime, and it avoids creating the erroneous impression that the activity is connected with street gangs.
Gang stalking is organized harassment at it\'s best. It the targeting of an individual for revenge, jealousy, sport, or to keep them quiet, etc.</p>
<p>It\'s a psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators.&quot;
Most targets are women, minorities, dissidents, whistle blowers, and outspoken.</p>

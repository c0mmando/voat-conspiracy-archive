            I'm so sick of defending the novax point of view to statists and internet fascists.  But here it is once again.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't want to be injected with a substance, even if the overwhelming majority of people accept it and believe it is beneficial, even if your opinion is based on religious nonsense or mistaken assumptions, it is morally apprehensible for anyone, including a government agent to force it on you.  It is your right to refuse any medical treatment for any reason.  And if you do so, it is nobody's business but yours.  For the government to keep a list of these people would be a major violation of their fourth amendment rights.  The exact same argument can be made against keeping a list of gun owners, aids patients, or political activists.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's that you say? "But what about people with compromised immune systems who can't take the vaccines themselves and have to rely on herd immunity for protection?"  Well, I have a few questions for you.  Is that my responsibility?  What about people with sickle cell?  Should we all be forced to donate blood to keep them alive?  What about people who are allergic to common substances?  Should we all be banned from eating peanut butter because it's a danger to a small portion of the population?  Maybe we should just put all the peanut butter eaters on a government watch list.  And if vaccines are so safe and recommended for all infants and elderly alike, then why are they such a danger to people with compromised immune systems?
           </p>
           <p>
            And here are a few more questions you might want to ask yourself.  Is it possible that vaccines can cause neurological damage in certain individuals?  Is it possible for some children to be damaged by vaccines despite showing no signs of a compromised immune system prior to the injection?  Why do vaccine manufacturers have legal immunity from prosecution?  That's a big one so I'll ask again.  Why are vaccine manufacturers protected by US law so they cannot be sued in the event of an adverse reaction from a vaccine?  Why does the federal government have a fund set up to "compensate" victims of vaccine damage?  Does that make you feel safe?  Do you trust the pharmaceutical companies to look our for your best interest?  Do you trust the government to make honest, intelligent decisions?
           </p>
           <p>
            And why are there so many documented incidents where an outbreak of a "vaccine preventable disease" such as measles occurs in a population in which more than 95% of people are fully vaccinated?  Could it be that there are other explanations for the decline in certain diseases, and that the pharmaceutical companies are just taking credit for it in an effort to push more vaccines on the public?
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't bother delving deep into the long list of preservatives and other dangerous ingredients contained in vaccines.  I won't bore you with details about contaminated vaccines or intentional sterilization programs conceived by governments around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you believe in vaccines, by all means, shoot them up.  Give them to your kids.  Nobody is trying to infringe on your right to do so.  But if you believe in the power of vaccines to protect you and your family from pathogens, then why do you care what other people do?  You're vaccinated.  You are protected.  If other people want to make "foolish" choices that put themselves at risk, then why do you care?  If you believe in the principles of liberty and the rights of individuals to live their life as they see fit, then stop trying to force your opinion on other people.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            tl;dr - Vaccines can be dangerous — sometimes more dangerous than the disease they claim to prevent.  Corporations and governments are untrustworthy and in order to trust vaccines, you must trust both.  People should be free to make their own choices.  Government lists are bad.

             I completely agree with you on the choice part. I think it's your right to choose if you want to be vaccinated. I've been vaccinated for all sorts of stuff from an early age, but haven't been vaccinated for anything else for 20 years or so. Personally, I see the benefit of vaccination, but there's always that %1 chance looming around that can  leave you in far worse shape than before.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no reason for them to keep a list of unvaccinated people simply because the vaccinated ones wouldn't be in any danger. Quite frankly, I cannot think of any reason what so ever to keep a list such as that.

            I too am a left-winger and therefore I too fully and wholeheartedly believe that anyone who believes [insert something I disagree with here] should have [insert description of some manner of the forceful interference with a peaceful human being here] and [insert some reference to little-understood foreign country that has been decimated by the intervention of western "democracies" but I conveniently blame their tragic destruction on the absence of a strong "democratic" regime here], particularly because they already [insert reference to something said by object of my scorn that makes my imagined punishment a deliciously and poetically just contrapasso here].

            Put 'em all on a fucking list--either that or stick them all in the remotest part of Alaska. Those nutjobs are a biohazard and have no place living in a developed nation.  Anti-vaccers are the the looney-end of the "personal liberty" movement.  They put other people's kids at risk with their fucking stupid, anti-science beliefs.  Fuck 'em.

            If they can show me a population who has no vaccs and are better off ,healthier , stronger then their argument would
at least have some validity. But they can't. Because they are wrong. It is that simple.

              Gee, I guess the eradication of smallpox is even not enough to convince you of the benefits of vaccines. Take a good read of what that disease did to people. I pity you and all you teach your nonsense too.

               I like how you already have a narrative in your head and know exactly what my stances are on vaccines because I dare question them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't have a problem with vaccines, I have a problem with how they're studied and how everyone says they are safe without actually proving it. If the health industry simply said "well this is the best we have, and yes there are side effects" anti vaxxers wouldn't have a leg to stand on. But when you cover up the side effects and not actually study the safety of vaccines, that raises lots of questions.
              </p>
              <p>
               If people had real world info and stats on vaccines and their side effects, they could easier make the decision whether to vaccinate or not.

                And how ethical would a double blind study be (giving some a placebo ) be in a vaccination trial?  I don't think anyone
really wants to do that.

                 Those are not major, most of those are for HPV. Where are the placebo controlled studies for all the vaccines kids need to get injected with? There better be a placebo controlled study for each one, otherwise it's not science.

             I think it's a bit more complex.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no doubt that vaccines work. 
I also have no doubt that vaccines can have unintended side effects. This could be from any number of factors, whether by design, improper storage, administration, screw ups, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             I personally eat as close to Paleo as possible, which means I very closely monitor what goes into my body.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question is, should I by law be told what to inject into my bloodstream? Or my kids for that matter?
            </p>
            <p>
             If the government was so obsessed with keeping my kids healthy, consumption of Coke would be illegal and so would half the shit at the grocery store.
            </p>
            <p>
             I strongly feel that the only reason this is such a big issue is the pharma lobbyists pushing an agenda. Not health concerns

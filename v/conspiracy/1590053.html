<p>TEAM H CAN GENERATE ELECTRONIC BLANK BALLOTS AND REMOTELY MARK THEM. IT WILL BE UNDETECTABLE. It has been a plan 6-7 years in the making, and once H is in, &quot;our US&quot; is gone forever - it will be in the hands of the Omidyar Group. It started in 2009 when Schumer got the MOVE Act passed that allowed new voting technology to serve overseas voters. Pew Charitable Trust provided supporting documentation for the Act. This is important because H\'s former COS, Luzzatto, (who was also COS to Rockefeller, recommended to him by Podesta) is Pew Sr. VP and Dir. of Gov. Relations. Since 2011 the Omidyar Group, through Democracy Fund (DF) has been funding studies used to support legislation and voting technology standards regulation. DF has also been funding Pew\'s Election Initiatives project. In 2013 an executive order created the PCEA, and most of the people on the PCEA are connected to Pew or to entities receiving grants from DF. Another Omidyar arm, Democracy Fund Voice (DFV) states on its site that it will work to appoint three EAC commissioners needed to reactive the EAC\'s Standards Board, responsible for approving new voting standards. In 2014, upon advice from the &quot;stacked&quot; PCEA, Obama appointed three EAC commissioners, all having ties to DF grantees. In 2015 the Standards board approved Project 1622\'s standard (which is trademarked.) This means they now have a common data format (CDF) that allows them to convert the data formats that vary across registration databases, voting machines, etc. In 2012, Pew released the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) a voter registration database that also contains information about but non-registered but eligible voters based on DMV and other records. Pew aggressively marketed it ERIC, citing Pew studies, the PCEA recommendations (from DF grantees,) evidence presented at Congressional hearings (again, all tied to Pew DF or H-camp in some way,) and endorsements from the NCSL (along with big contributions made to state SOS and legislators, e.g. Emily\'s List donated over $200,000 to WV SOS campaign.) In 2016, Pew offered grants to states joining ERIC by May 31. Pew is also offering grants to cover mailing costs for registration postcards, and several states have received them. ERIC is in 21 states. Ohio (a very recent ERIC join) is &quot;testing&quot; Random Ballot Marking System in the election. That proves RBMS IS operable - probably in all the ERIC states, at least. The RBMS was created by Civic Design - another DF grantee. Pew also created the Voting Information Project in conjunction with Google. The two Pew people instrumental in developing and marketing ERIC and VIP left Pew in August, citing funding cuts. They incorporated in September and one of them testified in the recent Oversight Cybersecurity hearing. Another thing - the Soros-connected voting machines are in ERIC states or states with other connections to the scheme I\'ve described above. Additionally, the entire VBM operation is in Omidyar\'s hands: VBM national coordinator, Tammy Patrick, is tied to Pew, PCEA, the TGDC (related to voting standards,) and the USPS link for election mail resources is to Election Center, funded by DF. THE OMIDYAR GROUP HAS TAKEN OVER OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. They even have an ad hoc congress that interacts with our own. If the new voting technology is trademarked - they will have control over EVERY future election. PLEASE NOTE - It\'s very possible all but a few individuals involved knew little or nothing about the &quot;overall scheme.&quot; As you can see, this is a complicated. I have a VAST amount of evidence, mostly from government sources.

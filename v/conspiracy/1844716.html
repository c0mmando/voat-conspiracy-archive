            i was not reasoning that the muslim population was evenly spread over any country. in the link i provided you could 
look for your country and see the numbers yourself , without me saying which country you were at ; which to me seems pretty decent
to do. if someone asks you : do you live in syria ?  ( and i actually typed : then you must live in syria or something. in respons to : "impossible to safely walk the streets" It is.... ) you could say : no , not al i live in that part of the world or in that country. and maybe , there are some cities with more muslims then other cities , ...
its an easy thing to do , instead , you play games . pretty strange behaviour and a total waste of time.

            , then in 2010 you had in your country 4.7 million muslims in your whole country, which is 7.5 % from teh total population,
but these numbers are from 2010 , so i do not know how much now . but its a big number. still do not be scared , be proud on your identity , your country, show them no fear.
they'll respect you even more for it.

            im in europe. i gave you correct numbers on the muslim population in my area.
so far i haven't accused you of anything, giving you a fair chance to be honest , but you called me names,
you accused me of being a liar , then of doxxing you/having access to your ip , without any reason.
why are you having a conversation like this ? im sure this is not handy for your real social life.
i just want to know which country has a city with 100 muslim families per every non muslim citizen.

            what ? lol im not doing anything. 
the ones who have acces to your ip adress are the moderators or at least the admin of this website.
im just like you a user , so they ( moderators/admin(s) ) are the ones who also have access to my ip adress , but users do not have access
to each others ip adress. i think your paranoid.

            i know what you mean , but where do you live now ? 
in the street i live , there are maybe 3-5 muslim families , but if i go a few blocks further to the innercity , its
3-5 non muslim families in a street with mostly muslim families. i have a dog and sure , most of the muslim women give an evil eye when 
i cross their path , but their reaction makes me laugh . and in summer times i like to take walks in the park , actually looking for these gangs,
when i do find them , they are just kids, hanging. never had any problems. people are scared easily, and i believe if your less afraid, people see
that , and are much more willing to leave you alone.

            where do you live ? where i live there are +/- 88000 muslims from the 495000 total population. thats almost a fifth. so for every 5 people you see here walk the streets , one is muslim. if you check my submissions you'll see that i made several posts about islam.if you after checking still disagree , then lets agree that we disagree.

            your really ignorant.
i see muslims every day of the week, no one has threatened
me or my family , i talk a lot with them. this is not fantasy ,its reality. you better do some research about the quoran , then look with your own eyes to the world you live in, and then make up your own mind. if you going with the narrative pushed by msm &amp; the like , without using your brain, that's not my problem.

            then you must live in syria or something.
where im at , i talk a lot with muslims about their faith ,their obligation being a muslim
( to spread islam any way they can ) their views on christians , jews , and most of the time
they just want to live , have a life / house / kids / car / etc. just as the christians .
i don't see any danger in that.

            strange thing is , in ww2 , muslims liked the nazi so much , they even fought for them !
i made several posts about the quran , its actually a book for war , the true muslims are the ones fighting, waging wars
beading people , etc. this means that ALL the other ones are in their eyes HYPOCRITES , worth just as much as an INFIDEL.
so if you look in your country , and maybe in your neighborhood , when you see muslims , most are not true muslims.
which is a good thing otherwise it was impossible to safely walk the streets.

            i believe the germans never liked that "nickname" nazis .
the people in those days (1920-1933) were totally disillusioned (bankruns/prostitution/poverty/enemplyment/etc) so when there was 
a total improvement of quality of life , offcourse they supported and followed their leader/government even harder; otherwise it could'nt have gone the way it turned out to be. it's not fair to judge all germans for the manipulation done by their leader/government. glorifying this manipulation is totally unjust.

            it has come to light that reinhard heydrich ( butcher of prague ) was the one who created false flag ops to be used by hitler as an excuse for taking in poland (1939)
           </p>
           <p>
            also there were shot 2.3 million woman and children. thats not a moderate thing to do i think.

            i believe most of the attacks are falseflag ops. with real victims.
from the moment the terrorists use the sewer system for a attack i'll believe it to be true.
(sewer system is full of methane gas which is highly explosive, using this will completely immobilize a city , bring disease , rats , etc ; TRUE terror)
the attacks are not STAGED , they are REAL.

             From my research it's obvious to me that none of the above attacks with the exception (maybe!) of 9/11 had any real victims. With Boston Marathon for example, there were amputee actors and fake blood and the same is true for several of these. In other words there's no evidence of any real injuries or real medical response

              true, if you look to the shooting from paris in the concerthall, there were 1500 people there, only 96 injured or dead ,
then the "terorists" make it a hostage , then one of them is on the run, gets persued by police , and instead of capturing the guy,
interrogate for more information , they shoot him dead ! this was so telling for me... the police never wanted any answers because they had NO questions !
it are all false flag ops , even 911 .

               Even the photo of the Bataclan was clearly staged. We only got that one photo of all the "dead bodies" but it just doesn't reflect reality at all. So many times in events like these when you get "graphic images" they are grainy low-res pics and this is no exception. And you can see how the fake blood smear was mopped into a heart shape in a very unnatural way. Some of the bodies look like dummies and do not have blood exuding from them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then if you look into the history of the Bataclan and the band that was allegedly playing at the time, they look like Mossad ops. The whole thing was a farce with fake blood and bad acting.

                the band are not with the mossad , the singer is a friend from josh homme ( queens o/t stone age )
the ex mossads i have met are pretty big guys and jews. that singer is not a jew nor is he big enough to be a mossad agent.
the photos could be staged , i find more answers in the actions of the police and justice department.

                 Well there are Israeli ties to the theater itself and as with any false flag where Islamic terror is blamed you can assume Mossad has a hand in it. I can't pinpoint the band's connection to Israel but I know they have toured there and Jesse Hughes made strong pro-Israel, anti-BDS statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The entire band seems to me to have been a cover-up. I don't view them as even a real band, but as some kind of outfit for the purpose of adding a Satanic theme to this fake shooting. If you listen to their songs, they're so incredibly bad that it's almost impossible to believe they are even a real band, let alone one that people would pay to see.

                  , its more pop/punk/rock band. and its a real band. when someone visits israel , it doesnt mean they are for sure with the mossad or any secret agency. there are probbably a lot of bands touring there. that doesnt make them affiliated with the mossad.
trust me , you do not get easily hired by the mossad.why don't you settle for the government itself from france/brittain/germany/usa/etc , they all answer to the same elite.

                   Absolutely I think the people who do this are some kind of NATO troupe that is enacting a one-world governmental agenda, like you say.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However, the instances where Israel has connections in many of these events I've named are too numerous not to notice, and it only follows that their intel agency would carry out some of the hoaxing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In fact like with 9/11 we see that the perpetrators operate on long time scales and plan these events years in advance. It wouldn't surprise me therefore to find out that a band had been formed with the idea in mind that one day they would participate in a staged shooting.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   One of the other photos from the Bataclan event that surfaced here recently was a picture allegedly right before the shooting broke out, and was extensively photoshopped to include people making the Satan horns hand gesture. The song the Eagles were playing at the time, allegedly, in fact was called "Kiss The Devil."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You're right that one comment or appearance in Israel does not prove any real connection, but I'm saying the band was definitely "in on it."

             In every one of these cases, there were no actual attacks.  Possibly September 11 was a real attack with real victims, but that's it. The Muslims in all cases are just patsies.

            To be fair, I base my opinions of Muslims on life inside Muslim majority countries. They are usually inbred shitholes with concrete caste systems. Americanism and Federalism, for all their failings (which are numerous) at least offers upward mobility for the common man and exaltation for the uncommon man. We have a unique and simultaneous reward and incentive system for both the lowly born and elite.

            Muslims are welcome here, but they must adopt the set of rules that make this place great and not impose the set of rules that made their homelands shitholes. In its history, Muslim expansion has always resulted in imposing Islamism in the conquered territories- with all the adjoining shitholedness.

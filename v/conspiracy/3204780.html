             Thanks for posting this. Brilliant video. Something about him was always off for me. He made some sense now I see he is just there to pacify the right. Drop me a PM if you have more good videos like this, would appriciate it. Def best video Ive seen in quite some time...

            I heard he got signed with CAA talent agency before his rise. I think his purpose is to lure away potential free-thinkers and keep them in the Overton Window. He makes the obvious point that there are 2 genders, and then people think he's a real truth teller, but actually he's a UN shill.

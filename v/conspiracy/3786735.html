<p><em>“for by thy sorceries (pharmaceuticals) were all nations deceived … And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.”</em>  - Revelation 18:23-24</p>
<p>Ancient terms of Pharmaceuticals: </p>

<p><em>Remarks from the author of the link above:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>• By her poison-based medicines, as mass poisoning, are found the blood of countless of inno-saints (innocent patients &amp; victims)! </p>
<p>• Fact: US doctors and scientists have found that the average poisonings (a.k.a. side effects) per medicine is: 70 </p>
<p>• This leads to the cycle of adverse drug reactions (ADR) or complications and polypharmacy (increase of the number of prescription drugs). The total number of medicines the average patient has increased from one to over 10! </p>
<p>• Pharma’s chemo: found to be 97% failure and causes the early death of cancer patients!</p>

<p><strong>What pain tells us in the meantime:</strong></p>
<p><em>Taken once more from: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ArnulfoLaniba/the-bible-speaks-against-pharmaceuticals">https://www.slideshare.net/ArnulfoLaniba/the-bible-speaks-against-pharmaceuticals</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>• The pharmaceutical method of pain relieving or symptoms suppression and nervous system disabling, has attracted many people to remove or silence or ignore the initial or early signs (e.g., pains) which serve as signals or warnings (trumpets) that something is wrong, that the person is doing wrong (e.g., diet or physical or moral act) and needs to repent or stop doing it. </p>
<p>• With the pain and other signs (symptoms) suppressed, the Brain or Person can no longer be properly informed (updated) of the real conditions of the organs or parts of the body. •Instead of the pain reaching the brain, the brain does not receive the pain message and so assumes that all is well; hence, continues to eat or do that which causes and worsens the illness. </p>
<p>• It is the ignoring of the symptoms or early signs with the help of pharmaceuticals that has allowed the complacency of the patients which leads to the advancement of the illness from stage 1 or 2 to stage 3 and 4 (too late). </p>
<p>• Pain is our friend. It informs us that we have eaten or done something wrong.</p>

<p><strong>How to combat pain &amp; regain life</strong></p>
<p><em>Taken once more from: <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ArnulfoLaniba/the-bible-speaks-against-pharmaceuticals">https://www.slideshare.net/ArnulfoLaniba/the-bible-speaks-against-pharmaceuticals</a></em></p>
<p>Genesis 1:29 – <em>And the fruits and leaves shall be your food [preventive medicine].</em> </p>
<p>Ezekiel 47:12 – <em>And you shall again have fruits as your food [preventive medicine] and the leaf shall be your [curative] medicine.</em> </p>
<p>Revelation 22:2 – <em>And the leaf shall be for the healing [curative medicine] of the [already-sick] nations. • Revelation 22:4 – And there shall be no more curse (illness, death, sorrow)</em></p>
<p>Revelation 21:4 - <em>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>• Purpose of Food: to prevent loss of energy, (premature) aging, early loss of youth and beauty, illness, (early) death • Hence, food is preventive medicine. </p>
<p>• Result of Genesis 1:29 – From Adam (930 yrs old) to Noah (950 yrs old) – LONGEVITY/ long lifespan </p>
<p>• After Noah, when mankind moved to meat and blood and started to ignore fruits and leaves: lifespan reduced to 120 or less.</p>
<p>• Only raw food, not cooked, can serve as preventive medicine. Cooked food cannot serve as preventive medicine. </p>
<p>• By cooking food, you will lose (thru evaporation) its health-giving and healing properties (nutrients) </p>
<p>• Moreover, <strong>by cooking food, you convert some substances in it into acrylamide, a carcinogen</strong>, which causes both aging and cancer. </p>
<p>• Hence, by cooking, you lose youth, beauty and long life. </p>
<p>• Only raw (uncooked or ripe) food, that is, fruits and leaves, and seeds, can serve as preventive medicine. </p>
<p>• ONLY RAW LEAFRUIT can prevent loss of energy. Cooking food will evaporate the energy- nutrients esp. at over 115oC . </p>
<p>• Energy from cooked food last only more or less 4 hours. You need to eat again. </p>
<p>• Can prevent aging (loss of beautyouth) </p>
<p>• Can prevent early death (loss of longevity) </p>
<p>• Cooked food or cooking food produces CANCER-CAUSING SUBSTANCE CALLED ACRYLAMIDE. </p>
<p>• So, the more you cook, the more cancer substances, which also causes aging, accumulate inside your body. </p>
<p>• The more you eat cooked food the faster you lose your youth, the faster you age. </p>
<p>• The more you eat cooked food, the shorter your life, the sooner you die! </p>
<p>• To recapture the long life of youth of our first parents, we need to go back to Genesis 1:29: Leaf and fruit that is raw (e.g., uncooked or ripe). </p>
<p>• GOD’S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM: FAITHLOVE, NOT POISON-BASED PHARMACEUTICALS </p>
<p>• In the entire New Testament, or the entire ministry of Jesus Christ, was a absolute demonstration of HEALING BOTH SOUL AND BODY BY FAITH AND LOVE, no physical aid. </p>
<p>• Faith is to be primarily exercised by the patient or if unconscious, by those who nurse him/her • Love is primarily God’s/Jesus’ response to the humble faith of the patient and/or caregivers.</p>

            • Only raw food, not cooked, can serve as preventive medicine. Cooked food cannot serve as preventive medicine.
           </p>
           <p>
            • By cooking food, you will lose (thru evaporation) its health-giving and healing properties (nutrients)
           </p>
           <p>
            • Moreover,
            <strong>
             by cooking food, you convert some substances in it into acrylamide, a carcinogen
            </strong>
            , which causes both aging and cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            • Hence, by cooking, you lose youth, beauty and long life.
           </p>
           <p>
            • Only raw (uncooked or ripe) food, that is, fruits and leaves, and seeds, can serve as preventive medicine.
           </p>
           <p>
            • ONLY RAW LEAFRUIT can prevent loss of energy. Cooking food will evaporate the energy- nutrients esp. at over 115oC .
           </p>
           <p>
            • Energy from cooked food last only more or less 4 hours. You need to eat again.
           </p>
           <p>
            • Can prevent aging (loss of beautyouth)
           </p>
           <p>
            • Can prevent early death (loss of longevity)
           </p>
           <p>
            • Cooked food or cooking food produces CANCER-CAUSING SUBSTANCE CALLED ACRYLAMIDE.
           </p>
           <p>
            • So, the more you cook, the more cancer substances, which also causes aging, accumulate inside your body.
           </p>
           <p>
            • The more you eat cooked food the faster you lose your youth, the faster you age.
           </p>
           <p>
            • The more you eat cooked food, the shorter your life, the sooner you die!
           </p>
           <p>
            • To recapture the long life of youth of our first parents, we need to go back to Genesis 1:29: Leaf and fruit that is raw (e.g., uncooked or ripe).
           </p>
           <p>
            • GOD’S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM: FAITHLOVE, NOT POISON-BASED PHARMACEUTICALS
           </p>
           <p>
            • In the entire New Testament, or the entire ministry of Jesus Christ, was a absolute demonstration of HEALING BOTH SOUL AND BODY BY FAITH AND LOVE, no physical aid.
           </p>
           <p>
            • Faith is to be primarily exercised by the patient or if unconscious, by those who nurse him/her • Love is primarily God’s/Jesus’ response to the humble faith of the patient and/or caregivers.

            Population regulation is an enevitabe issue we will face at some point.  Carrying capacity is reached in any biological system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Course it’s something we should come to terms with and control via mindset and customs not mandated vaccinations and microchipping, save that for Africa

            Good Info here, raw foods and vegan diet is a cure for many illnesses brought on by overconsumption of unhealthy foods.  2 yrs, 3 yrs on the diet is fine.  After that you have to go back to a "normal" diet otherwise it creates other health problems because of the depleted soil which grows depleted fruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds.  If you are able to grow your own in rich soil then this is the ideal diet as described in the bible

            Vaccines are associated with lower population growth rates because dramatically lower child and infant mortality rates mean most parents don't feel the need to reproduce over replacement rates when their children are practically guaranteed to reach adulthood.

              Niggers in the US were effected, south asians whom I wouldn't expect to be effected reduced their population growth; from the perspective of all the professionals working on population control I can understand why bill gates said those things and why they are probably more accurate than you would think.
             </p>
             <p>
              If I resent gates for anything it's his aid to africa, you can cry about unverified sterilizations in kenya, 7 years and nothing conclusive, or india purchasing cheap, low quality oral vaccines for polio which are less effective and can rarely give the person polio, the indian government was warned that it would innoculate their population against polio but that it would cause numerous infections.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think this whole gates panic is largely to make us look crazy and to distract us. Consider how many disinfo news sources get shared on voat habitually by our power users, tredditfirst for example is pretty clearly some sort of disinfo account, I'd bet people who let their guard's down on this website have been taking in loads of propaganda unwittingly for the past few years, look at how so many lies about the virus being a hoax were accepted without question by hordes of our users. now they are inventing conspiracy theories to cope with their own ignorance and incompetence to cover up their foolishness. Gates put an easy target on his back by advocating the micro chipping and if somebody kills the man for it I wont shed a tear.
             </p>
             <p>
              Vaccines will reduce population growth even in africa, though I doubt it will bring it anywhere in line with us; 6-9 kids become 3-6 kids over a generation or two but most of them survive into adulthood to reproduce and you have a lag generation where people are still having 6-9 kids and that's how "developing" nations get huge population spikes, what bill gates is doing will mean adding a billion new niggers onto global population. In his mind this has to be done now because if we wait eventually it will be done and could mean 2 billion extra niggers, I would say that letting them starve, die to disease, and kill each other is a better idea than helping them now to slow population growth sooner because over the long term it helps ensure their population stability and I want them all gone.

                I've never seen proof for either claim, I know voat has gotten a whole bunch worse in the last year because people are accepting unsourced reports from qtards and disinfo plants but seriously source either of those claims I'll wait.

                Gates can catch a bullet if he wants to try micro chipping anybody but I haven't seen any evidence to either of those claims.

                  If I had to put a number on it, and I do, I'd say israel probably has more than 16 nuclear weapons, probably no fewer than 6 nuclear missile silos, probably 8 ICBM long rang silos to reach europe or even america, russia too, likely building one for china, and maybe as many as 60 short range nuclear weapons prepped in silos for the samson option.

                 <p>
                  I reiterate, vaccine skeptics are barely literate on the science and are almost all rhetorical failures because their lack of knowledge and hasty conclusions based on weak science accepted to meet their biases drives away intellectual discourse and renders scorn from the public and the educated, the pro vaccine corporations are also doing the same poisoning of the rhetorical well, failing and refusing to address legitimate vaccine concerns or support independent testing, instead they intentionally pay shills to make their critics look crazier and stupider by shilling fake and easily disprovable hogwash setting up antivaxers to embarrass themselves.

            The Ferengi and their culture are characterized by
            <strong>
             an extreme mercantile obsession with profit, trade, and exploitation for gain, in which greed, extortion and scamming are considered praiseworthy behaviors
            </strong>
            and acquisition is raised to the status of a near-religion. They are also known for their business acumen and for rampant misogyny, with wives obligated to remain naked and at home,
            <strong>
             and women sometimes forced into the sex trade
            </strong>

            They do. I remember, there was a jew in my high school physics class. He was proud of his reputation of being "the smart kid". We got along really well, and I thought he was a good guy. He was jewish, but he'd tell funny jew jokes and was generally chill. When it came time for our last test, before the final exam, some kids were lagging (as usual). So the teacher threw in some bonus question: material not covered in the class, but easy enough for anyone with a creative brain to figure out. This kid would always ace everything, and would jokingly rub it in, when I'd miss a couple questions or so. It was all fun and games.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was the only one who scored perfect on everything, including all the bonus questions, in this particular test. He failed
            <em>
             all
            </em>
            of the bonus questions. The teacher gave me a bit of small praise, and I sat there pantomiming mockery at said jew
            <sup id="fnref:1">
             <a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">
              1
             </a>
            </sup>
            , every time the teacher looked away.
           </p>
           <p>
            The jew got beet-fucking-red. He snapped. I had never seen such anger and venomous retribution, in my entire life, up till that point. He was a completely different person. He was raging so hard at the teacher, that spittle was flying from his point and his eyes turned as red as his face. Screaming obscenities about how unfair it was that we were being graded on material not on the test. That the teacher was intentionally trying to sabotage him. He said something like, "the fact that this retard's the only one who got them right means they're questions that should have never been there to begin with. This is bullshit. I'm going to the principal over this." And on and on and on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eventually the teacher agreed to simply apply the bonus score bump to everyone, as if everyone got the bonus questions right, just to get him to shut the fuck up. Later in the class, he would look over at me and pantomimingly mock me
            <sup id="fnref:2">
             <a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">
              2
             </a>
            </sup>
            , when the teacher wasn't working, for getting his way. It was such a jarring experience. I was confused for days. Stopped talking to him after that and he turned in to a smug asshole for the rest of the year, towards me. It was my first ever insight in to the mind of a jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gradually, I grew to hate them.

            Off topic for a minute, but seeing as Jews and Star Trek were mentioned together I thought these numbers would be of interest? The Character 'Q' appeared on Star Trek TNG for the first time in 1987 and he was described as an omniscient and meddlesome sage not unlike the god known as Loki who spoke in riddles and rhyme, does this sound familiar? 'Q' made his first appearance thirty years and thirty days before Qanon began posting online, Q=33. I found that out today and thought I'd share it for pig iron. (30 yrs 1 mth)
           </p>
           <p>
            'Q' first appeared in Star Trek TNG on Monday September 28th 1987:

            You have no idea what the Jews are trying to do and if you figured it out you'd probably lose your mind at the fact that you opposed it. There are bad jews but what they want to do as a collective isn't evil. Power corrupts and that is why we are seeing these people spiral into deranged demagogues.

                I resent ever representing your interests but I did it out of love. Unfortunately it seems like that's not an emotion you're capable of feeling.

                  You're wrong, no one helps people like you to virtue signal. I wanted to understand the other side and I was ultimately convinced for a while but ultimately the solutions are twisted and based around fear. I've been fucked over by the left too, that doesn't mean I want the opposite extreme.  I'd rather a religious left that has a code of ethics than a godless ethnostate that pretends to be Christian.

            the jewish role models become famous for being an ass and making a jokefest out of it. every known jew figure has his own signature crime. all the crimes comitted get turned into funny jokes and are celebrated by the kikes.

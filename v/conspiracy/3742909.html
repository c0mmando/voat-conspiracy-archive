            I can, with pretty good confidence, tell you that US is planning for a war agaisnt China and Russia within the next ten or so years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big 2 plus 3 is who it's projected on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Big two being the names above.  The three are Syria, N. Korea, and small terrorist organizations world wide.
           </p>
           <p>
            US also expects heavy casualties as they've not fought a neer-peer war since WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will most likely bring back conscription as well due to current numbers and quality of service members in the Armed Forces.

            Not even, if their figures are even vaguely correct they stopped it spreading pretty quick.

           <p>
            My theory on this part of that point is it was less a literal inoculation and more a "You can't blame me, I was the first victim, clearly it was someone attacking me" optics move.

             Even if true, the actions taken by Americans needs to be the same.  Seek to defuse or overt war, but stay united so that if war does break out we end up on top.

             Military is in charge of the USG (via Trump) atm.  You'll also note that Trump declared gun stores essential businesses.  That's not a sign of an administration trying to be your enemy.

             If you're paying attention, Trump declared gun stores essential businesses.  That's NOT a sign of a government that is trying to control its population.  It's more along the lines of making sure the population can arm itself against an invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Has "government" fucked us in the past?  Hell, yes!  But there's a new administration and the policies are changing.  Everything I'm seeing indicates that this administration (and the military that is backing it) is not interested in controlling the population.

             I don't like it.  I want my liberty.  But don't shoot the messenger.  The situation being set up by China (backed by the bankers) and the USG (backed up by the military).  It is something that will have to be endured.  The division happening on the internet regarding "is it real", "the USG is the enemy", "don't trust the quarantine" works to the advantage of Chinese (and the bankers).

              You do realize that while you are locked down, up here in Canada, we've been asked nicely to not gather in groups. The Canadian government is more afraid of the Canadian people than the US government is of you heavily armed Yanks.

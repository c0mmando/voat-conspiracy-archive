             I also just gave $100 this morning to try and get people talking about long term funding...I was a lot more optimistic then about most users knowledge when it comes to net privacy and running a business than I am now.

             I've given around $600 over past six months and $750 PM to Putt for an answer in private message multiple times of nothing sensitive, or $500 for just even informing me of a rough time frame when I can expect to be able to pay in BTC.

              Yeah, I don't think he is into dangling, especially when (obviously) a ton of other shit is going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Were I in his shoes (and especially now, with the conspiracy posts etc.) I think responding to you would be lower on the priority scale. There's no guarantee of the payment ever being made, and you're publicly asking him to be your bitch. (Not to say your idea isn't good, I imagine that Putts wouldn't argue against that, either.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you very much for your nearly 600 in donations over the past 6 months!

               I PM'd him first multiple times over the course of months so as not to be public, also in almost every public message I've thanked him for his time and work.
              </p>
              <p>
               He said hosting costs were $6000 or so.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am happy to pay $300 per month in BTC adverts, i.e. 5% of hosting costs. I'm a long term user with a validated history of donations.
              </p>
              <p>
               A ton of other shit?
              </p>
              <p>
               He just posted a few days ago possible site closure due to lack of funding?
              </p>
              <p>
               How is funding not very high on the priority scale?
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: I get your point though, just that if i fall into the low priority scale, then Voat is in a lot better financial position than we are told.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for 5% of main operating costs I would do a lot to gain that discount, be it personally visit a supplier, call and thank a customer, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               It has worked for me, why not Voat?

                I just looked at your submissions from today alone and you're shitting down the guy's throat. There are a lot of odd people on this site, to put it kindly.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you carefully read Putt's statement, he's lost with Voat, seems to want to move on or something
                <em>
                 big
                </em>
                to happen, and is looking for hundreds of thousands to really build out Voat. While you are being incredibly generous, 300/month is just not on that scale.
               </p>
               <p>
                Maybe he also has personal things going on, or it's a particularly stressful time at his job.
               </p>
               <p>
                Putts has gotten back to you and your request once, correct? What did he say?

                 I wouldn't call it shitting down the guy's throat, especially as this is what keeps websites alive, internal investigation. Why do you think Reddit died? Because there was no internal integrity.

                 I don't give a fuck about donating myself, I care about a system being implemented that allows business owners and users to run advertisements without paying and linking their real name.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I could go to jail for some of my posts edit (look up NZ free speech laws).

                 For the work to money ratio, you'd have to earn over $2,000 per hour to not make my PM request reasonable.

                 He got back to me on one $150 donation saying thanks and that they were going to do it, but then nothing ever came of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 From here, I'm just leaving it as it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If the userbase thinks that investigating these kinds of things is shitting down someones throat, it isn't exactly the kind of place I want to advertise any privacy related product or IOT product.
                </p>
                <p>
                 *The $150 was about 4 months back from memory.

                  Call it what you will, but you made 7 posts about this today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I was just looking at a submission of yours from 18 days ago.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You were offering Putts 160 to investigate hecho. In the same thread, you said it didn't matter if you were doxxed because it would potentially help you sell product. There was certainly no stated fear of jail. I doubt NZ's laws changed that much in the last 18 days.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you have a legit business, then why not start a new Voat account and tie your advertising to that? Done deal, it's over.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Anyway, all I was saying is that it can be difficult to separate the poseurs from the real peeps here. And Putts as a rule
                  <em>
                   never
                  </em>
                  responds to pings. (Obv. it happens once in a while, but it is rare.) Anyway, we should hear more from him tomorrow. In my experience, if you want a response from him, you just have to catch him at the right moment.

                    I guess that's what I'm missing here. So you set up another user account that would go along with your adverts and all is avoided. Unless what your company is selling is shady, too, I don't really see what the issue would be.

                     As in, the products I sell are legal internationally but not domestically due to NZ's ridiculous freedom of speech laws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So, if I paid domestically for advertising my products, there is a chain of evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In order for me to advertise on Voat I'd need to setup an international bank account, in a country with a dispute with NZ, to be safe in payment.

                   Yes, if I was doxxed the products I sell would increase in sales, but I'd also have to go to court, the two are not exclusive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Do you understand what I mean by that, particularly in regards to privacy related products?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To investigate a user being able to track comments of another user without a ping is what I wanted investigated, Hecho is just a pedo and I hate pedo's but whatever we don't talk.

                  <p>
                   Edit: Yes it can be difficult to seperate the poseurs, but what would you have me do? Just disappear with no offers?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also, there was no stated fear of jail as there is no identifying factor to my username and real name currently.

                   If I donated via credit card there would be. I.e. someone can dox me, say that I am Goater, but there is no proof, with a credit card payment you can bet there is multiple layers of transaction evidence.

                    hecho probably searches his own name. And if he really dv's everything resditisdead comments, he may have already had the tab open. hecho is a filthy pedo scum, but he's also a master troll.

                    It just seems that the court issues may have come up during that convo. Anyway, no, I don't know specifically what products you sell, if that's what you're getting at.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So why not just make a different account to hawk your products?

                     Anything else I'll answer in the morning, but I know my business and my countries laws, so find it hard to take legal advice from someone that doesn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     No offence, you may be great at finance in your country, but international trade is always a pain, unless you have some specific advice for me as a qualified lawyer, I can't really act on it.

                     Also, my business isn't my main concern, frankly at Voat's rate I already calculated it would be a loss anyway it was more for the support, my biggest concern as you can see from the chronological path of submissions was the lack of Privacy policy, as someone that runs e-stores, that point really concerns me.

             As someone that was willing to sponsor this site to the tune of around 1/10th it's current costs according to the announcement, I'm really reconsidering.

             I love the old goats and thankful for the work that Putt has done for Voat, but after the last 48 hours of trying to clarify privacy and get user support for funding, whats the point?

Sentinel From Space
Has the Earth been visited by a satellite from an ancient alien civilization?</p>
<p>The Black Knight Satellite Sentinel From Space
 theunredacted 02 Mar 2018
As the shadow of the 20th century loomed large, enigmatic scientist Nikola Tesla claimed to have received the most amazing message in human history.
Tesla had just set up in Colorado Springs, where he built a large magnifying transmitter to further his investigations into the wireless distribution of electricity.
Soon after he began to receive mysterious signals on the equipment, that seemed to be coming from space. Three impulses, one after the other at fixed intervals. One…two…three.
Tesla was entranced. After carefully dismissing all known natural phenomena, he believed he may have received a signal from intelligent life on another world.
Some today suggest that Tesla had picked up signals from pulsars — spinning neutron stars that emit radio waves, although it remains unknown exactly what it was he observed.
At around the same time, Italian radio pioneering Guglielmo Marconi was experimenting with using radio to transmit morse code signals. To his amazement, he found some of his morse code messages returning back to him, sometimes years later.
These discoveries caused a major stir in the press at the time, with talk of aliens from Mars trying to contact the Earth. However, the strange signals were soon relegated to a curious scientific footnote, not to be revived for nearly 30 years.
In 1927, Jørgen Hals, a civil engineer in Oslo, was using an early commercial radio receiver to listen to shortwave transmissions from a station in Eindhoven when he noticed something extremely odd.
The signals were being reflected back by something. These echoes came at irregular intervals, sometimes 3 seconds, sometimes 15 seconds. Hals had discovered what would later be known as LDEs - Long Delayed Echoes.
The LDEs so intrigued scientists that from 1928 to 1930, a huge experiment was conducted into the phenomenon. The echoes were certainly real, but nobody had any idea what was causing them.
Further experiments in France and the UK in the 1930s left scientists equally baffled. To this day, there is no agreement on what is behind LDEs, although few scientists believe they have anything other than natural origins.</p>
<p>But could Tesla’s speculation back in 1899 be correct? Was there some intelligence behind the echoes? Were they even a message from aliens?
In 1954, an amazing story appeared in technology magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology that suggested exactly that. The US military had discovered 2 mysterious satellites in Earth’s orbit.
The Pentagon was reportedly furious about the story. They had not wanted the discovery to be made public. An explanation was quickly put out that the satellites were actually asteroids.
Whilst it is possible for Earth’s orbit to capture an asteroid, it’s extremely rare and only happens under certain unusual circumstances. Many scoffed at the Pentagon’s explanation and the widespread belief at the time was that they were artificial.
Had the Russians managed to secretly get something into orbit 3 years before Sputnik, the first publicly acknowledged satellite? Or were the objects from further afield in the universe?
By late 1957, the Soviets had just launched their second satellite — Sputnik II, carrying a passenger, a small dog called Laika. But it also had a more mysterious passenger, because it was been tracked in space by an object and neither the Russians or Americans had any idea what it was.
In 1960, the US Navy’s Dark Fence radar system made an even more spectacular discovery. They had detected a large black object in polar orbit around the Earth, possibly weighing as much as 15 tons.
What was particularly odd about this was neither the US or the Soviets had the ability to put objects in polar orbit in 1960, and the purported weight was far beyond what either country were capable of getting into space.
Like the incidents in 1954, press reports of the discovery caused a major splash with the public. And like 1954, the Pentagon quickly stepped in to kill the story — it was just space debris from a Discoverer rocket launch, a suggestion that did not convince many.
Whatever it was in Earth’s orbit had also acquired a name — the Black Knight satellite. The origins of the name are unclear, but it may have been based on an inchoate satellite launching rocket the British had developed called Black Knight.
The object would continue to be seen, but it was very unpredictable. It would vanish for long periods before reappearing years later. What could it be?
The most intriguing idea came from an eminent Stanford space scientist, Ronald Bracewell, and his theory for how an alien civilization might communicate with Earth.
Bracewell proposed such a civilization may send a probe out into the universe looking for planets that could evolve intelligent life. They would lie dormant in orbit around the planet until the occupants were advanced enough to send radio signals into space, at which point it would send a signal back.
Was the object found by Dark Fence a ‘Bracewell probe’? Fascinated by the possibility, Scottish science writer and amateur astronomer Duncan Lunan decided to go back and reexamine the data produced by the LDE experiments in 1928.
What Lunan says he found was absolutely astonishing. The Scot had a hunch that the seemingly random delays observed in the echoes from 1928 might be significant. He mapped them on a graph and was staggered to discover they formed the pattern of a constellation.
It was Boötes, a constellation in the northern sky home to many bright stars. One, a binary star system called Epsilon Bootis was central to Lunan’s theory. Amazingly, he claimed to have decoded a message from it’s inhabitants.
Had the Black Knight satellite finally revealed its purpose? Was an alien civilization from deep space trying to communicate with the Earth?
In 1998, compelling visual evidence for the existence of the mysterious satellite finally emerged. The crew of the space shuttle, Endeavour managed to take dozens of clear high-resolution photographs of a strange black object near their craft.
As in 1960, the object was dismissed as space debris — a thermal blanket that had come loose during the construction of the International Space Station.
But the photographs just fuelled more speculation about what was in the skies. The old stories of Tesla, the LDEs and Duncan Lunan’s star map were revived.
After more than a century of speculation, the big question still remained. Are there ancient alien satellites in Earth’s orbit?</p>',

            Both real and fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            Check out photos.  There are a LOT of them.  Black knight photos show a solar blanket or whatever it's called.  If there was something more ominous than that, photos of it would have been scrubbed from the interblags.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take for example Blasey Ford's yearbook.  Even Google image search previews are coming up with a missing image icon, warning triangle.  She wasn't even the nominee.  She was some accuser with no evidence, and she got all of that scrubbed HARD.
           </p>
           <p>
            So is the Black Knight real?  No and maybe.  No, the photos are all bullshit so far.  Maybe there is one bizarre one like that up there though.  There are a great many satellites we don't know of with capabilities we'd be right in imagining are shocking, and still more with capabilities we probably couldn't imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Technology follows an exponential curve, and we're intentionally kept behind in our knowledge and understanding of it. How long did it take to reveal the B1, B2, SR71?  Aurora has essentially been admitted through not denying it, yet it still isn't declassified.  20-40 years USED to be the general rule.  I'm sure we're even farther behind now.

              There are REAL conspiracies to concern yourself with.  Stop wasting my time trolling.  You deserve and will get no further replies to legitimize your projecting.

               Wow.  The Cult of the 1st Amendment.  Gee.  With stuff being scrubbed (and all the deep state killing Reddit and moving on Gab) is there any hope that we will see the REAL truth ever?  Like ever?  Thanks.

             It is probably a UTI or simple bladder infection.  Cephalexin (Keflex) is old but pretty effective.  Unless of course you are just being a faggot about my post and you like to run strange things up your urethra.

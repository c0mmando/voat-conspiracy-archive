The connection is the honeypot. I feel it in my bones... Did you know Paddock was seeking a long-term lease in downtown LV? Within weeks of the shooting? Doesn\'t sound like one planning to go out in a hail of bullets. It also matches the pattern that played out with Danley during their courtship... Danley\'s lawyer said in a statement, on her behalf, that she was a little worried about him breaking up with her too... Idk... 
This will probably be shot down here, as it was before. </p>
<p>Paddock was a man of patterns, habits, even mildly ocd wearing the same clothes most of the time. Outed by Danley as a hypochondriac, except Paddock called it allergies, said Danley in a statement. Why a room full of his guns? A connection to criminal activity, following a pattern still, with a slight shift aided by a honeypot? These are the questions swirling in my mind. 
He brought the guns... that\'s a fact. But why? No GSR, so he didn\'t shoot them... 
FBI, Local Law Enforcement, and other Gov\'t agencies are tasked with protecting UN assets while in the country. In this case, FBI and select LVMPD protecting an asset in Four Seasons. Honeypot(s) in position in MB to move on the asset. Paddock executed. Shots fired from 32-134 to signal gun fire detectors drawing attention to Paddock and away from helicopters. Helicopters provide smoke screen and draw attention to venue and away from those closing in on asset. Asset protection successful, while Americans are injured and killed by helicopters and possible grounded gunman. </p>
<p>FBI along with select LVMPD/Sheriffs refuse to assume liability and create distance by trickling narrative down and pinning all on Paddock. Ultimately fading into the background. Body cams manipulated, reports unfinished. Behind the scenes, assailants are dealt with and connections to the truth are severed. 
Now, finally, they feel comfortable closing the case and providing this three-page-farse... Still, probably just crazy thinking on my part.﻿ Qwell now? QWELL NOW Q? Q? Q??? WTFUA??? WTFUA????? WWG19/11/187/10/1WGA&amp;WTFUA? WTFUA? WTFUA??? FRFOFLFMFFFAFO.</p>',

            Not interested in Paddock. He's obviously a dead patsy.

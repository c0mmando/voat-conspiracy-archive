            Buddy, "judeo-satanists"? Come on, that implies that #not all jews worship satan, wich is a pathetic lack of understanding on your part. They may not all know it, but they practice animal sacrifice, usurey and have the religious directive to lie, cheat and steal from people outside the cult. Its an evil satanic political, economic and social framework of parannoia, hate, deception and madness dressed up as a faith.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Quick fellow white people, lets shit on white history, say everything good, like Nazi Germany, Captalism, Collonialism, Patrioism, Christianity, the Crusades and inquisitions ect are all bad and made by bad jews, then we can help good jews beat the bad jews and all the stuff they made, then we win." -(((fellow conspiracy guy)))
           </p>
           <p>
            Pro tip, if jews are on your side ang you "win", that means jews win, wich means you lost. Take WW2 dose it feel like we won any more? We sided with the good jews to beat those bad nazi jews and commie jews, so that means we won, HMMMMMMM.

             Any religion that makes blood sacrifices to their "god" is Satanic by definition. The "god" of the Old Testament is a demon.

<p>It\'s important to know that your local &quot;Neighborhood Watch&quot; groups are teaching these harassment tactics to your neighbors to create a destabilized community, and promote false community leaders that have ties to protected organized crime such as Drug Dealing and Human Trafficking! It\'s networked through your local community service organizations, churches, social clubs, etc...
Ambient abuse is a major tactic, and Gang Stalkers use this tactic in combination with other covert abuse tactics. Targets are under 24/7 observation. Sometimes this monitoring has gone on for years before a person even knows they are a target of a group. So first there is the emotional trigger.
Someone from the Stalking group will be told by a higher level perpetrator some small bit of personal information about you that they feel will make you (the target) uncomfortable or knock your self-esteem off balance. They will use some event in your past that you may feel guilty about now. So let\'s say you go to the store or market, and some shady looking guy comes up behind you and says something to you that relates to a past event in your life. You may become shaken with an emotional reaction. Your mind will question this verbal event, and by doing so, your mind becomes focused on what was said and is now open and distracted from the task you went to the store for in the first place. So the Gang Stalkers have now opened the door, and they will now continue to sensitize you under this condition.

            Dear TargetedIndividual,
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect you suffer from a mental illness known as Paranoid Schizophrenia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gang Stalking exists.  The odds you are targeted for it are minuscule.  Weigh the odds.
           </p>

           Caesar was the part time rent-a-cop who led RFK by the elbow into the pantry in June, '68. What I find astonishing is that in 50 plus years nobody has stuck a camera in this guys face (or made a serious attempt to track down) whatsoever down in the Philippines where this guy (probably in his late 80s) still resides. He clearly lied about the caliber of weapon he had on him that night (which was .22 caliber) which he sold three months after the assassination.

            I think the main evidence for him doing it is the coverup, you never hear about him, not mentioned in wikipedia or books about the murder, this tells me caesar was CIA and is the one who did it. Coverups always prove guilt.

             Somehow obscure camp guards from the 40s can be tracked down in their 90s all across the globe, prosecuted, jailed, yet zero effort made for this guy reeks. He's probably living under a completely concocted alternate identity courtesy of the US which explains it.

            Yeah, it was obvious from the first couple paragraphs how disingenuous it was.  Are they ever going to give up on Russian hackers?

            I'm just glad she threw people under the bus.  Interesting times we're living in.  We're watching the complete collapse of our two party shitshow, I believe.

            So sweet to see hildabeast being abandoned now that all the Trump investigations point to her, lol. And great point about the "written deposition". How many will she bring down with this book? Outstanding!

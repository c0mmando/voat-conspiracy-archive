Of course its discordant to claim that in a bunker full of people nobody could definitively say he took poison, or shot himself, or both.

<p>This is the commonly held chronology of the final days of Hitlers life, and its a pastiche of wiki, and other public sources: </p>
<p>March 20    Last public appearance</p>
<p>March 30    Hitlers personal doctor leaves the fuhrerbunker under the orders of Goering</p>
<p>March 31</p>
<p>April 1        Headquarters moves officially to fuhrerbunker</p>
<p>April 2        Third day of withdrawal from his daily injections of cocaine, methamphetamine, and testosterone not given by his doctor. 
 The third day is always the hardest, the comedown must have been enormous</p>
<p>April 20      Hitlers birthday- Goering leaves bunker- Famous photographs taken of young boys receiving medals</p>
<p>April 21      SS General Steiner ordered to attack encircling army 10x the size of his own, refuses</p>
<p>April 22      Hitler announces to his general staff that he has no more orders. Telegram sent announcing intention to commit suicide. 
 Diatribe against generals depicted in Downfall memes.</p>
<p>April 28      Last known photograph </p>
<p>April 29      Hitler learns of Mussolinis death-- Marriage to Eva Braun</p>
<p>April 30      Breakout order signed --- Alleged suicide </p>
<p>May 1         May Day- Stalin disappointed that Battle of Berlin is ongoing- Goebbels children poisoned </p>
<p>May 2         Official Surrender </p>
<p>The timeline breaks from reality at around April 22. By that point, Goebbels and Goering agree in their last meeting that they would have to prepare Germany for a future without Hitler. Goering had prepared a will and last testament (which I suspect either Trange or Bormann rewrote to make it sound more Hitlerish) and Hitler responded by refusing to sign it. Its my belief that his motivation was that Germany would not capitulate to the USSR on May Day: the communist holiday, and forced all parties to agree to fight until the second. Stalin, being a pragmatist, did nothing to force the issue. When Steiner calls the bunker and demands to speak to Hitler, he\'s rebuffed by being told that he\'s &quot;busy&quot; even though there is nothing he could possibly be doing at that point. That is in all likelihood a euphemism that Hitler was already dead by then.</p>
<p>Goebbels probably killed his children first to work up the nerve to kill his boss. Eva Braun went next, and her last letter was dictated to her, or at least coerced. Christians generally do not burn their dead, and thats a good indication that the situation with Hitlers body was already a bit off. It might be the case that Goebbels wanted the situation to be forever surrounded by mystery, or the shrapnel wound he received in the \'thigh\' in WWI was actually a wound to the groin that left him impotent. Another simple possibility would be that Goebbels did not want the people who found the body to be able to identify if the gunshot wound was self-inflicted, or if it was given to him while Hitler was in a seated position.  The dogs went last. He then coached everyone on what they would tell the Soviets when they got there. &quot;Oh, he shot himself&quot; would be said by half and &quot;oh, he took poison&quot; would be said by the other half.</p>
<p>SMERSH interviewed everyone immediately after the battle, and they are the only source for any information. They\'re also not a terribly reliable source. Russian culture has always been \'closed\' so its difficult to figure out just how much they knew. But we have it on absolute irrefutable proof that they tore Germany apart to find the dental records.</p>',

            With all due respect, their is also alot of evidence to show Hitler made it to South America and lived out his life. I believe FBI files have been released showing they were keeping tabs on his where abouts. I'm  pretty sure in the beginning when Q first started up he had alot to say on this subject.

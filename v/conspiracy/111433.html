            <p>
             Indeed so all those measurements that were made are called a "DM". (Dispersion measurement)
            </p>
            <p>
             Now a "DM" is a good general way to measure distance.
            </p>
            <p>
             However some of the DM are "impossible" distances to be able to keep the pattern, which is always being a multiple of 187.5
            </p>
            <p>
             So you see what no Prof or "scientists"  wants to say is , 187.5 IS probably the distance to the guys sending. ( when just using a normal DM measurement. )
            </p>
            <p>
             I.e if we were finding a pulsar or neutron star putting out a predictable pulse and we measured the DM and it was 187.5 we would know the star is X " lightyears" from us.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this case, the DM varies always because they (the sender) wants to Prove it's an "unnatural signal" BUT the message is 187.5
            </p>
            <p>
             So you simply do some 1+1 and say "well is 187.5 thier distance from us."
            </p>
            <p>
             But no one , once (that I have seen) has ever brought this up....???
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean wtf?
            </p>
            <p>
             THAT my friend should tell anyone reading this a LOT about both the planet you are on and if you should be concerned or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ok to make that clearer:
            </p>
            <p>
             DM can be produced "artificially" by passing the signal though an "electron field" of magnetically charged particles.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is almost certainly what the guys sending us the message are doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             This means the big DM measurements are just made that way, but the message is always 187.5.
            </p>
            <p>
             The basic message is obvious:
            </p>
            <p>
             " Hi we are at 187.5 DM distance though normal space from you"
            </p>
            <p>
             But we can get a lot more from the message as well, but you know....I guess our first offical non human message from another race just isn't the stuff of the "front page" ?????

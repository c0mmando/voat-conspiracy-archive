But I remember Bob Lazar from when I was a kid and yesterday <a href="https://voat.co/user/salvia_d">@salvia_d</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/comments/810461">posted a video</a> about Bob Lazar that got me thinking.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, I knew that Bob Lazar was an attention seeking habitual liar or a delusional. <a href="https://archive.is/WIZoH">Wikipedia</a> confirmed this. It almost confirmed it too good because the whole thing is negative. E.g. it was written by someone trying to make him look bad. It goes on to include quotes from a scientist who, in the fashion of a hard-core atheist or zealot, says he has refuted most of Bob Lazar\'s claims.</p>
<p>Looking for the last nail in the coffin I got on youtube and started searching for things like &quot;bob lazar is a liar&quot;. First thing that comes up is <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/3ku8.png">this guy</a> but I remember watching him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xErxo41P_E">argue with Bill Nye on Larry King</a> and thinking he was an idiot so I skipped it and moved on to a surprisingly interesting clip <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iezJY74GsX8">Bob Lazar: 25 Years Later</a> done by the news crew that originally interviewed him. I\'m sitting there looking for signs of a liar but came away seeing him as pretty believable. </p>
<p>A little more googling:</p>

<p>An honorable mention is a youtuber who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qcX4cmD4KU">claims</a> to have found the S4 hangars. I think he\'s just imagining it so I cracked open Google Earth to look for myself. I didn\'t find anything but took a few screenshots. <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/3kud.png">general layout</a>, <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/3kue.png">road going by s4</a>, <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/3kuf.png">where youtuber sees the hangars</a>, <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/3kui.png">Maybe if I apply a filter I can see it. Nope. I have no idea what I\'m doing</a>. I guess the big take away is that Lazar said where all of this stuff was years ago before satellite photos were commonly available.</p>
<p>I listened to a few more interviews (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFdpBgCbv5E">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFdpBgCbv5E">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkLllqltU2s">3</a>) and he sounds very honest and like he knows what he\'s talking about to me. He is very clearly not some idiot who just attended community college as Wikipedia wants you, so very badly, to believe. There\'s something else. The story is that he claims he attended the California Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology but there is no record of it. Now, a quick note, there was also no record of his birth at the hospital until George Knapp tracked down the Dr. who gave birth to him (reference to this is in the lie detector video). What I want to know is if he can provide basic information about, say MIT. Can he tell you where the drinking fountains are or the names of any of his professors? It seems like this would lend a lot to his credibility. He actually claims, though, that he does not want people to believe him anymore because he is running a scientific supply company and doesn\'t want to be known as &quot;the UFO guy&quot; but if you look at his companies <a href="http://unitednuclear.com/">website</a> it\'s clearly not representing itself as a professional business. So is this resurgence of Lazar just another lie and he actually is trying to get attention while pretending he does not want attention so he doesn\'t have to be grilled about simple things that anyone who went to MIT would know? Or is he really just a guy who doesn\'t want attention and doesn\'t want to add more to a story that has made the whole world ridicule him? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I just want to make clear that I think <a href="https://voat.co/user/xeemee">@xeemee</a>\'s comment is absolutely ridiculous. No offense. I was not looking for someone to post a wall of text about a hundred different things with links to wacko UFO nut videos. I was wondering about a very specific thing that seems like it could be reasonably figured out. I am not a space cadet starting a journey into ufology or whatever the shit. </p>',

            please don't take offense, but if you don't believe we have been visited, then you are way behind the curve - this is not a question that is even debated by any serious person with an open mind who has researched the subject
           </p>
           <p>
            take a look at this video of a D.C. press club event in 2001 - Greer has approximately 500 highly credible witnesses, mostly all ex-military and defense, who are prepared to testify before congress ... except congress doesn't want to hear them - the creditability of these witnesses
            <em>
             cannot be questioned
            </em>
            - there are military people here who were in charge of Minuteman nuclear missile silos - you can bet your ass they the most reliable, patriotic, sane, cool-headed people on the planet (well, that is if you consider nuclear arms to be "sane" - LOL)
           </p>

            are you aware that several countries have been
            <a href="http://www.disclosureproject.org/countries-releasing-ufo-files.shtml">
             declassifying and releasing documents regarding UFO's
            </a>
            , including France, the UK and, recently apparently, the US
           </p>
           <p>
            are you aware that, at the same time the US Air Force was making a mockery of people reporting sightings, they were secretly investigating UFO's?
           </p>
           <p>
            try to find an Apollo astronaut that
            <em>
             hasn't
            </em>
            seen a UFO or does not believe we have been visited
           </p>
           <p>
            seriously, the fact that we have been visited is not up for debate - the question is: HOW ARE THEY GETTING HERE?
           </p>
           <p>
            if you understand that, then you will understand why the whole thing is being covered up
           </p>
           <p>
            regarding Lazar, i cannot say definitively whether he is creditable or not, however the theory he offers for the propulsion system on the "sport model" is very much in-line with what many other witnesses have to say and it fully explains why a vehicle can make 90 deg. turns while traveling at extremely high speeds (because they create their own gravitational field that is separate from any other body)
           </p>
           <p>
            but how do they move between solar systems?  were talking distances of hundreds/thousands of light years which means they must be traveling at speeds which far exceed light ... or ... are bending space-time and, essentially, not really "traveling" at all
           </p>
           <p>
            once people realize they aren't burning fossil fuels in their vehicles, guess what happens to the fossil fuel industry? 3rd world countries? starvation? transportation? etc., etc., etc. - the whole world changes radically in a very short time and THAT'S why it's being kept from us; GREED
           </p>
           <p>
            Lazar is fun entertainment,
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Billy+Meier">
             Billy Meier
            </a>
            far more so in my opinion because his case is very well documented, has been going on for decades and is supported by probably hundreds of witnesses
           </p>
           <p>
            nevertheless, i'd suggest looking into the question of how these technologies could be used to change the world and release us from the bonds of 'Big Oil', thereby halting the destruction of our planet in the name of the all mighty DOLLAR
           </p>
           <p>
            have fun - it's an interesting journey for sure

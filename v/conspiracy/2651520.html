<p>If OP read a little further</p>
<blockquote>
<p>68-year-old taxi driver, Carlos Enrique Gonz치lez Noriega. He had apparently refused to pay extortion money to the gangs that controlled the area surrounding the town of Rio Bravo. 
The teenager\'s father was a member of the feared Mara gang, according to Guatemalan newspaper La Prensa Libre. He is in prison, and so he sent his daughter, with two men, to murder the disobedient driver.  <strong>After the killing the two men ran away, but the girl was caught with a gun in her hand.</strong></p>

<p>So just a few minutes of doing a few duckduck searches and someone is able to find relevant information to the post that they are making.  Do your homework!  literally 5 minutes of searching will yield you enough data online for you to make an informed opinion.

               The point is people can't research on their own.  They should be able to find OPs post on their own with some twat like you just feeding it to them. This is exactly why people are sheep being led to slaughter.

           I'm sure there has to be some controlled opposition to ending the wars and not starting them. But if it were completing silent I imagine that might spark a reaction more than just having a loud useful idiot blabber on about it. That way there is that one guy who can control the movement. Nobody will care and think at least something is getting done about it. Whereas if it were just totally banned, it would create too much of a backlash that couldn't be quelled if it snow-balled.

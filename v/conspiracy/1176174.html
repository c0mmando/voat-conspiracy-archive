            I just started using cash again for mostly everything. My regular bank card doesn't have a chip in it though, so it's still usable.

            Chip cards have been used in Canada and Europe for years, long before smartphones and mobile payments were a thing. Yes, just having a RFID chip doesn't  make it more secure, that's why everywhere else uses a Chip+Pin combo for security. But that would be to much work for you lazy Americans.

            Cash is only as fast as the cashier is capable of counting change. But still faster than the chip reader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Change can just get tossed into a jar and cashed in once a year or so, banks sort it for free.  it also doesn't hurt to have a couple dollars worth in the car if you travel a lot.

            they aren't rfid. Smart card chips are not rfid, so you can be safe. I however don't like them, they are annoying. Swype? Nope. Insert. Sign. Wait. Wait. Pull out.

            while they may look like gsm sim cards, they are not. The only reason I dont use mobile pay is because I don't want my phone linked to my money, social stigma my ass. Most of the time the pay centers for mobile pay aren't even there.

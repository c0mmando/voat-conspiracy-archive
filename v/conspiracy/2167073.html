Conspiracy theorists are already coming out.
There was a video circulating of muzzle flashes from a 4th floor window and tin foil idiots saying that there was a second shooter. Even though many of us could edit that flash into a previously downloaded video and re-upload it to social media, from our damn phones.
Lets break this down shall we? Here\'s my best educated guess from the footage I\'ve seen.
We know we have one shooter with some sort of bump fire or hand crank operated medium range combat rifle/s. The random ROF is an easy indication of this type of device. (My hunch is a 1919A4 with hand crank) and that he fired from two locations on a corner room hotel suite from elevated platforms within the room. It would have been easy to bring a handheld drill and secure the T&amp;E to a desk in one room and have a modified AK on a desk/table by the second window ready to go.
The breaks in gunfire could have been from moving from one window to the next and/or changing belts/mags. The hotel FCAP was alerted to a smoke detector signal from his room early on, no doubt from the gun smoke. It would have been very hard to see in that room after the first minute from all the smoke building up in your line of sight so that could have slowed him down as well.
You can clearly hear the sound of a gatling type ROF (the hand crank) and a bump fire type AK sound with higher and more consistent ROF. The rounds were still supersonic when slapping the concrete and the hotel room was about 400meters away. So I\'m sticking with 30 caliber rifle rounds here.
It would have been easy to slowly acquire and bring those large guns into a hotel room, not even a question. He planned this carefully. He had two vantage points, multiple guns, and days to plan and execute. He would\'ve had to start planning this when the concert date was announced as that hotel room most likely would have been booked early on.
As for the aforementioned second shooter video. I call BS. The FCAP would have alerted to a smoke detector in that room as well and since that important detail was missed by Mr. Psychopath I highly doubt an accomplice would have had the foresight to slide a shower cap over the detector to prevent an alarm. And lets not forget the report of a high powered rifle easily detected from a interior 4th floor hallway, spent shell casings, GSR, cameras, etc. The second shooter wouldn\'t have made it out of the building.

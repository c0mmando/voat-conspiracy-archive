            they loan to anyone that wants to build and has the credit. It's why American buy giant trucks and so on. The wanting to move in immigrants is another issue. Trump and these developers develop land and so on that they sell to sketchy people to launder their money. That's the conspiracy. Casinos, real estate, ect.

            take issue with your NIMBY point where wind turbine farms are concerned.
           </p>
           <p>
            grassroots locals want
            <em>
             none
            </em>
            of that shit fuqqing up property values and continuance of rural lifestyle.
           </p>
           <p>
            advocates of wind farms frequently “out of town” landowners.

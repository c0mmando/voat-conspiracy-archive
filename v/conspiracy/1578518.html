<li>
<p>The only people “hacking” the US election have been the two political parties.  The Democratic Party actively conspired against Bernie Sanders and actively stole thirteen primaries from Bernie Sanders using electronic ballot tampering. The Democratic Party also organized roughly three million dead, duplicate, and illegal alien voters. The Republican Party used various means to repress a million black voters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Russians – as well as the Israelis, French, Germans, Chinese, and everyone else on the planet with any curiosity – have absolutely been conducting electronic espionage against US political targets. They have not “leaked” anything (generally intelligence services try not to demonstrate that they have successfully hacked in anywhere).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “leaks” from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to WikiLeaks were a combination of disgruntled NSA officials furious with Hillary Clinton’s mis-handling of classified materials (including sending emails with classified information to IP addresses in Saudi Arabia and Qatar), and a DNC insider with authorized access who shared copies – all this according to William Binney, Julian Assange, and Craig Murray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exposure (I use the term advisedly) of John Podesta as a very unethical political operative with very strong possibilities of also being a pedophile, resulted from a single phishing expedition by a single hacker who social engineered Podesta into changing his Google email password through an intermediate site that then was able to steal all of Podesta’s email. This hacker is in jail in the US and it is almost certain that he is collaborating with a US intelligence service, not the Russians.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final “leaks” came from the New York Police Department (NYPD) after it confiscated a laptop from Anthony Weiner that turned out to have – it is alleged – all 650,000 emails that included Huma Abedeen as an addressed. This is a mother lode. The FBI immediately sequestered this machine, but not before the NYPD copied many of the emails and leaked the fact that they provided evidence of treason by Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedeen in taking money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia in return for regime change in Syria and Yemen as well as classified information in passing; and information reinforcing the possibilities of female as well as male pedophilia in the highest ranks of the Democratic Party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only intelligence services that persistently spy on US politicians across every device they own are the US intelligence services, specifically NSA, with CIA focusing on selected Senators and Representatives. NSA has explicitly spied on Barack Obama in detail since Obama was a junior Senator. The US media, very much under control, is both replaying the false narrative against the Russians, and strictly avoiding any independent commentary on the fact that it is US traitors, not the Russians, who are the threat to US peace and prosperity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is highly likely that the neo-Nazi element in European leadership is conspiring with the neo-Nazi, neo-conservative element in US leadership, to start a war with Russia. The assassination of the Russian Ambassador in Turkey, the assassination of the NATO chief auditor about to expose a Euro 250 billion black budget used by NATO to bribe politicians and carry out false flag operations, and the various false flag operations in France (these with Mossad assistance) and Germany and elsewhere are all part of trying to start WWIII – war is a business model for the City of London and Wall Street, for the Vatican and the Rothschilds.</p>

Local Indian tribes validated the existence of the reptilians in their oral history and validated the hypothesis that the catacombs exist and have gold stores.

<p>Well now comes Elon Musk with a new company and he plans on boring his way under the Los Angelos underground. 
If you overlay his current plan with where the 1933 excavation took place, you will notice that there is an intersection of Echo Park, Dodger Stadium and Union Station, an x of sorts, that marks the place where the first excavation took place in 1933. </p>
<p>Does Elon know that he is going to be boring into the same area that the 1933 excavation took place?  Who knows, but maybe Elon Musk created a company to search for underground treasure?</p>
<p>Stay tuned...Maybe this will fund Elon\'s Mars Expedition. (Check out the name &quot;Elon&quot; and Werner Von Braun what he said about Mars in relation to this name.)</p>',

            I am getting heavy vibes of Clive Barker's
            <em>
             Midnight Meat Train
            </em>
            here. Even if the machine bores into a tunnel network, there will be a pre-assigned group who will make the workers sign a NDA. and give them a large payoff to keep their mouths shut (cause they will be needed for the other tunnel projects)

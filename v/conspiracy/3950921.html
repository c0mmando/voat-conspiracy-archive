<p>For what it’s worth, I am not a shill and I haven’t taken a vaccine since the tuberculosis one I took in elementary school. I am very much against vaccines, not against the science behind them, but against the fact that they are loaded with all kinds of disgusting trash and human DNA, metals, etc., not to mention that there is basically zero transparency.</p>
<p>Now that that’s out-of-the-way...</p>
<p>So last year I listened to this guy David Goldberg in a video he recorded in May. I listened to it because he died in a suspicious way in June and it was his last recording, which made me interested in learning what he had to say. For those of you who haven’t listened to it, it can be basically summarized as:</p>
<p>The elites have a secret plan (Project Pogo) to use social media to determine all the anti-Zionist people in the US, then systematically kill them (Project Zyphr). The documents that he had access to supposedly detailed to some degree how they would achieve this in a sneaky way that would not lead to a mass uprising / fight, because they realized that as many as 15 million people would have to die in order to achieve their goals of getting rid of anti-Zionists in order to usher in a new world order.</p>
<p>When I first listened to this last year I didn’t think much of it, other than the fact that he had been found dead with foam coming out of his mouth which sounds like a deep state murder kind of thing. Other than that, it seemed pretty ridiculous. But then one of the things he said was gonna happen did happen, which was the rolling power outages in California. David said in one of his videos that “they” would experiment with a small area power outage “later this year” (2019) to prepare and measure the response before they implement a large scale power outage “next year” (2020). Then another thing he said came almost true. He said that Trump would declare himself the “king of Israel”. Last September a guy, I don’t recall his position, stated exactly this, that Trump was essentially the “king of Israel”, and Trump quoted the guy in his own tweet. In other words, Trump tweeted the text stating that he was the “king of Israel”, and even though he was just quoting with somebody else said, he was also acknowledging it and thanking the guy. If I had to come up with a percentage of “Yep that prediction came true“ I would say that’s about 75% of the way there.</p>
<p>Here’s where it starts to get scary.</p>
<p>David Goldberg said that the way they would get rid of the anti-Zionist dissidents is with a virus. So ever since the coronavirus situation started I’ve been thinking about this, thinking about “yeah but how could they kill all these people specifically without raising suspicion”, until I realized “wait a minute, contact tracing…”. We already know that they plan on taking people out of their house who are suspected to have contracted the coronavirus based on close contact with other suspected cases. They’ve laid the groundwork in many areas for this, including incorporating contact tracing into iOS and Android OS. They also made it so that you can’t go to the hospital to visit loved ones, so if somebody you know gets taken out of their house because of “coronavirus” and taken to a hospital, there wouldn’t be any way for you to go there and verify that they truly were sick or not. So then when they call you and say “we are sorry to tell you Johnny has died”, it might be suspicious but they would have a layer of plausible deniability. So imagine a scenario where a third wave (this propaganda has already begun) starts to spread and it is a much more deadly version of the virus with a supposed death rate of 5%. Now imagine all the people who are suspected of coming into contact with this super scary new version of the virus start being taken out of their homes and dying in the hospital, which fulfills the fear panic needed to keep it going, while simultaneously giving them the ability to remove tired of people without any real suspicion. If they did this now everybody would be suspicious, but if they did it during a “much deadlier” version and the whole country was on lockdown in panic mode, despite some suspicion from people like us, they would definitely be able to pull something like this off.</p>
<p>So that was kind of a mode of thinking that I was in for the past few months until I had an epiphany. I was thinking about how in the video David put out that he never said anything about the virus being fake. And whatever access he had to whatever documents he had was definitely something, otherwise his predictions would not have already come true to the degree they did. So if he was saying that they were planning to get rid of these dissidents with a virus, then unless he had a gross misunderstanding of the meeting, it doesn’t seem like my above scenario is the correct M.O.</p>
<p>This is where it gets really scary.</p>
<p>Think about how politicized coronavirus response has become. If you wear a mask your leftist, if you don’t wanna wear a mask you’re right wing, if you believe in HCQ’s power, you’re a Trump supporter, etc. As time has gone by, it has become more and more split down party line and you can easily see this happening. People on our side are very much opposed to taking any vaccine, but especially a vaccine that is being promoted by some scoundrel like Bill Gates. So think about this: what more efficient way could you think of to kill all of the people like us then to make us Vehemently opposed to this vaccine, and then release a virus that kills everyone who didn’t take this vaccine. They would literally kill all of the skeptical minded people and probably a lot of the generally right leaning people in a single fell swoop. This would be World War III done in a single year. Especially if what they released was airborne; there would be no escape.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but this possible scenario gives me fucking nightmares.</p>',

            They would pay the consequences eventually if they do, and if this indeed is done to build up Israel, then it will only lead to it being torn down that much faster. Karma exists and it works across people, groups, and nations. Israel had a wave of goodwill after WWII that it could had rode on forever if they could have just let go of the idea of conquering and controlling everything for its own preservation. Which is sad, because I like Israel as an idea. The execution of it has just been awful.

              Well, it's basically a huge theme park for both Christians AND Jews worldwide, and there are a ton of Muslim rides there too. Why not have it? Everyone can go, and have a great time, and maybe even become friends. The problem is that it has to be owned and operated by an unaffiliated third party, like the Native Americans or Aborigines or something. Otherwise we get the shit show we have now - everybody fighting over the same three square miles of supposedly "holy" land that is at this point so blood-soaked that Newark, New Jersey looks like the Vatican in comparison.

            Hey OP, good post first of all, I hear ya.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now go watch this movie: 'The Domestics'
           </p>
           <p>
            It is at least as dystopian and almost a carbon copy of the extermination you describe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also suggest, the critical viewing of the UK Drama: 'Utopia' where 'Janus', which is a virus released by sleeper agents who are prompted to act by encoded news media reporting mass shooterings, which basically makes all except a 'chosen few' genetically picked group of people completely unable to reproduce.

             Holy crap that second UK movie sounds terrifying. Thanks, man. I will definitely watch The Domestics first.

              It must be odd to see Mr KillYourTelevision recommending films. Its the medium not the media, today it is netflix but the point is the same, one way mass media isnt a good practice, but there are both gems, and there might be predictive programming, if there is, we should remain aware and view it vigilantly, if it isn't then we should enjoy media responsibly and as per our preferences.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, I archive media, which in the 90s sounded funny to think a show could be lost, after all, we had DVDs and like 10GB hard drives. Yea that didnt last and now I'm 20 years older, and files I collected and kept are now impossible to find. They might even be gone cuz you can buy some of em. No commercials in them ofc, so just the stories, stories are important for humans, thats my overexplained view on media and below are....

              <li>
               A boy and his dog (well played horrific, medium dystopia, fine film, probably programming)

               Brave New World (Movie is fine, free in full on youtube, its the grainy VHS one, 3 hours long, listen to it at least once a month)

            My pet theory is that the real elite don't do anything coersive (short explanation is that karma's real), they let people do things of their own free will.  So I doubt they would release a truly dangerous virus on their own.  But they would offer a vaccine that they can't say if it's safe or not.

            Oh, and here's the recent Hollywood tie-in for you - Captain America: Winter Soldier.  I was thinking they were going to use 5G go get rid of their enemies but now I think whoever was working towards that end has been neutralized.

             That’s super interesting. I had a similar thought when the Newtown “massacre” went down. I kept thinking “in my heart of hearts I don’t believe this shooting actually took place, so how can I believe these people are truly completely evil?”, which of course doesn’t actually mean they aren’t evil, but it’s interesting.

            I saw this when it came out. I can't rule out that Goldberg faked his death and was doing some revelation of the method without having to answer for it. There's going to be disinformation embedded in his message too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything with coronavirus points to them already having decided who is going to be testing positive for it. It's just a matter of getting their targets to take a falsified test, or come into contact with with someone who has already tested positive (the infector could also be an asset/agent of the plan who is trying to make contact with the targeted individuals) and they have the "asymptomatic carrier" framework with which to monitor targets whereabouts.
           </p>
           <p>
            There will be more changes in the rules of engagement. I said it right at the start that coronavirus will keep on changing until they get what they want. That's why as of yesterday I started calling it "smartflu" because despite whatever efforts people make to mitigate infection it always finds its way through any defence.

            This is related to one of the questions I can't discern the answer to:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Why release a non-deadly virus?
            </strong>
            If further control is the Globalist goal, why not release a legitimate danger?  The hoax is so transparent and poorly maintained.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can only see three options at this point:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             As per the OP, it is an intentional psyop to cleave non-slaves from slaves.  If you can see the hoax, then you won't get an injection.  If you won't get an injection, then you're not a slave.  All non-slaves are thus identified for elimination.
            </li>
            <li>
             A non-deadly virus was intentionally released by the US Military to bait the Globalists into hastily executing their plans.  These plans are only partially countered to allow the public an opportunity to see what these people have planned for them and how they go about executing it.  In other words, it is counter-psyop by USMil to wake up the world.
            </li>
            <li>
             Creating and distributing an ACTUAL dangerous global pandemic without unintended and/or severe consequences that would interfere with subsequent Globalists plans is difficult or low risk/reward.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            More?

             Those are all great potential explanations for what’s going on. I honestly, after thinking about it a bit, I think that option number three is the most occam’s razor/reasonable. A lot of people knew Sandy Hook was fake, but still they pulled it off and kept their lies going.

            Great post. The Lift The Veil guy (can't remember his name) did a video a while back investigating "Goldberg's" bio and concluded it was fake. Be that as it may, you are right in that Goldberg's predictions seem fairly accurate. But as for killing millions... How would they know this would get rid of all "anti-zionist" dissidents? How do you know you got em all? What if some opted to take the vaccine?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the bigger concern, actually the biggest concern that is being ignored or poorly understood, are the technocratic measures of control that are quietly being put in place. If this infrastructure and tech becomes fully realized there will be no escape. I'm talking about things like real-time contact tracing, immunity passports, digital IDs, social credit scores, facial/body recognition cameras, chips/implants/tattoos, internet of things and bodies, cashless economic system, etc. all tied into the emerging 5G network.
           </p>
           <p>
            This will really separate out the "dissidents" from everyone else. The way things are looking, this covid psyop and the coming financial reset is about getting people into "the system" and if you want to continue working and eating you will have no choice but to join this new system.

             I hope you’re wrong, I almost hope for a much worse case where they are trying to kill people, because this technocratic future (James Corbett talks about this a lot) sounds like a fucking nightmare.

              Unfortunately I think it will be a combination of killing and technocratic control. Big cities in China are the model for technocracy that they want to see worldwide. The writing has been on the wall for years; smart phones, smart meters, 5G rollout and now this talk of immunity passports and etc. The Agenda 2030 plan calls for herding everyone into "smart" cities for the reasons of "climate change" and "sustainability."
             </p>
             <p>
              The opposition to all this coming slave tech is what everyone should be rallying behind. This is the most dire threat looming, and nothing is more important IMO.
             </p>
             <p>
              Corbett is great. Here's something I clipped where he talks about why the "defund the police" thing is really being discussed -

               Absolutely agree. A lot of this tech will be rolled out in such a vast quantities that it will be like 15 years of dancing on surveillance tech in the span of a single year; it’s difficult to roll that sheer volume back ever.

            I would not this past them. They definitely want to cull the herd by up 95% according to the Georgia Guidestones. Perhaps they will try to stave us out (i.e. the people who don’t get the vaccine/biometric tattoo) by not allowing us to hold a job or buy and sell. The contact tracers will be their secret police to further harass us to death and eventually throw us into FEMA camps to be culled. For the elite, and those workers chosen to live, they will be given a saline placebo vaccine. This is so the sheep don’t get suspicious. For those to be culled, the sheep, they will be given a vaccine that either stops their ability to reproduce or gives them a cancer to slowly die off over time. Whatever happens, we need to get right with God, because we are now in an epic battle for humanity.

             People on our side are very much opposed to taking any vaccine, but especially a vaccine that is being promoted by some scoundrel like Bill Gates. So think about this: what more efficient way could you think of to kill all of the people like us then to make us Vehemently opposed to this vaccine, and then release a virus that kills everyone who didn’t take this vaccine. They would literally kill all of the skeptical minded people and probably a lot of the generally right leaning people in a single fell swoop.

            Do you mean that they will have the Covid vaccine secretly immunize people against Virus X, which is deadlier, knowing that the useful idiots will tend to get the vaccine and not skeptics? Then they can release Virus X and wait for the skeptics to die off?
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a pretty compelling idea. Seems a bit out there but it would definitely explain the unnecessary lockdowns, mask orders, curfews, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are not reasonable responses to Covid, both in terms of the actual risk it poses and the huge economic, social costs of doing so. The media and gov't have done an excellent job of politicizing this as you said, it is not at all about making your own decisions with the available data - people are increasingly being divided into two camps, each one hysterical about the other, and not moving their position no matter what. This makes the skeptical camp an easy target, because by the time the vaccine rolls out, they will be vocally opposed to it and you can wipe everyone out with Virus X at your leisure.

              I haven't done much research into vaccines, so I can't say either way. Whether they actually immunize against diseases or not, it's obvious there is something in them (intentionally or not) that causes vaccine injuries. These are so prevalent that
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
               Congress had to legally to eliminate the liability of vaccine manufacturers
              </a>
              because they had difficulty obtaining liability insurance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, any further investigation into this topic is dismissed by (((the powers that be))) as tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.

            The problem is their virus is bullshit, and they pretend to know more about viruses than they claim they do, and they way over exaggerate the abilities of viruses as some sort of super bug that can take over the world, and that's just not how viruses typically work. So their bark is greater than their bite. Now that's not to say that perhaps part of your figuring of their plan isn't a hit.. just I don't think they can do it.. I think you're giving them too much credit in biology. But now think about the rest that you have said, if they can pull off contact tracing they don't need a virus that opens up the possibilities quite a bit.

            Here's another way of looking at it:
           </p>
           <p>
            When the hell was the elite ever nice to the black populations of the world? Never. They make it obvious they hate them. Then, this year they are put on a pedestal. Is it because they are the ones being lead to slaughter? Trump didn't beat the system, he was put into power by the system. They are dividing us with clear lines of right and left because they intend to destroy those who don't go along with the system. The Left with their luciferian/pedo stuff finally got old and the elite saw a need to change the program. If Jews do control the world, or at least America, we have Donald Trump with Jewish family members doing good things for Israel while Hillary's emails shows she refereed to Bernie Sanders as "the Jew" in a negative way. She was all for China and the Muslim Brotherhood which are both anti-Jewish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe they are planning on triggering something that is already in our bodies with the vaccine. It's not a secret that the elite call us "useless eaters" but who is more useless to them? If they divided us into two groups to destroy one of those groups why do you think they'd destroy the ones who are employed and productive, farm workers and people who make things that they use? It wouldn't make sense to keep the unemployed scroungers who have time to sit around all day plotting to destroy things. Both sides are obedient to a higher group but one is more useful to those in charge.

             niggers are too stupid to serve the jews. whites are to smart to serve the jews. so the plan is to mix them and kill off all the outliers. need to tighten up the variance.

             Not at all. I’m just saying, if you were an elite and you were planning to get rid of the cohort of the population that is most likely to give you trouble, doesn’t this seem like a pretty efficient scheme?

             I’ve never taken a vaccine under my own volition. I don’t know how I feel, but I definitely am scared to death about the possibility of that scenario.

              No weapon formed against you shall prosper.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do they not believe in spirituality? Even if evil, they believe in something, and that gives you a clue.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only thing they hate worse than whites, is Christian whites. I go boldly against them, and trust my God to see me safe and sound.
             </p>
             <p>
              And if I die? So what. I get to be in heaven.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, while I live...I fight. The battle now is not to beat them, we are too small for that. The battle now is for lost souls, and every one we get is spit in their evil faces. We will win in the end, and they can’t do anything about it.

             It does sound low, but if you think about it that’s probably about the exact number of people that would offer any real resistance. People who made me feel a certain way but not strongly enough to fight back are of little consequence.

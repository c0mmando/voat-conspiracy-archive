            Not a book ever written condemns jews more then the bible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who says otherwise is a bold face liar.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only time they ever "had it good" was when they were keeping Gods law and the faith of the coming messiah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which was less then 1% of the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are wicked people.   Just as every other type of person on the planet.
           </p>
           <p>
            A high horse, none of us should be on.      All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

              If there book is the bible,  then no.  It damns them.  In plain language.
             </p>
             <p>
              But they reject the bible.   The talmud (oral law) is their book.

            jews made a world domination book. christians made a jim jones kill yourself and go to jesus book, or stay around and the jews will be your master. Muslims have their sharia law pact. Asians also have their be smarter and wealthier to rule over the world book. Crazy russians appear to really take anger on the jews.

                  Old testament no mentions of HELL. Not one in the original text. So why was this feature added? Sheol is just place for the dead. Where the dead spirit goes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So perhaps they try to gain converts in later years with fear based programming.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I mean I guess having to reincarnate through all time once more and go through the souls journey starting in a fire and brimstone would be considered a hell.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To me it describes one having to start the cycle of rebirth from the start. The birth of a planet and your soul having the procession through the species, existence once more.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  IT really would be a very harsh punishment. and it might take an eternity, since you can fail again, if the evolutionary process is similar.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But Hell, in the New testament seems quite different, and I have to wonder if fear based programming was the intent since we see fear based programming throughout all of society. It is a rather effective method to get people to behave somewhat, but not necessarily believe in GOD or TRUST GOD. IT seems counter intuitive  to a "ALL LOVING GOD" unless of course you are able to do the process all again. And you are given opportunity to raise yourself out of Hell.

                    i'm allowed to understand things, form my own opinions and come to my own conclusions, they do not have to be the same as yours. If we disagree that is not the end of the world, we don't have to be enemies. We can still get along.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Whether or not I'm wrong, or right. Shouldn't mean we have to be mean towards each other. But we can choose to do that, because we are free to express ourselves as we do.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I just think people often expressing something counter to any "group" ideology, or even an individuals belief system, This some how is taken as an attack. While I'm not attacking you, or your belief systems I'm wanting to understand. My disagreement if any presented isn't an attack, My questioning isn't an attack, my opinion and interpetation wasn't an attack.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    My speech is not an attack.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    While I don't think your speech is an attack either. It certainly felt accusatory.

                    I'm not making excuses. What excuse are you talking about I'm sharing you my perspective and understanding. Intentional? Who the fuck said I was free from judgment?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Wow you take offense by someone making comments in a comment section and misinterpret their discussion as thinking they are free from being judged?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Instead of having the discussion. You make it seem like i'm opposing you, talking down because i'm not holding the same exact view as you?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I was asking you questions, then I made a statement on what I thought it represented.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I asked where does it say hell so i could read it myself.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I then wrote
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     So it isn't called hell.&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I intend to put a question mark ? at the end but I put period by mistake.
                    </p>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Then I make my observation, statement.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Not one place have I put you down, intentional misinterpret anything. I was curious to know more. But you see enemies, you see me questioning as threat. So weird how this happens time and time again. Whatever. Have a good day.

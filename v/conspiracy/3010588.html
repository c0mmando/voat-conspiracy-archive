            Sahih Bukhari (62:137) - An account of women taken as slaves in battle by Muhammad's men after their husbands and fathers were killed. The woman were raped with Muhammad's approval.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Bukhari (34:432) - Another account of females taken captive and raped with Muhammad's approval. In this case it is evident that the Muslims intend on selling the women after raping them because they are concerned about devaluing their price by impregnating them. Muhammad is asked about coitus interruptus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Bukhari (47:765) - A woman is rebuked by Muhammad for freeing a slave girl. The prophet tells her that she would have gotten a greater heavenly reward by giving her to a relative (as a slave).
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Bukhari (34:351) - Muhammad sells a slave for money. He was thus a slave trader.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Bukhari (72:734) - Some contemporary Muslims in the West (where slavery is believed to be a horrible crime) are reluctant to believe that Muhammad owned slaves. This is just one of many places in the Hadith where a reference is made to a human being owned by Muhammad. In this case, the slave is of African descent.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Muslim 3371 - Muhammad and his men take captive "some excellent Arab women" from the Banu Mustaliq.  Their dilemma then becomes that they want to rape the women, but they also want to 'ransom' them, knowing that their captives will be of less value if pregnant. When they ask Muhammad about coitus interruptus, their prophet tells them that it doesn't matter how they rape the women because "every soul will be born" anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Muslim 3901 - Muhammad trades away two black slaves for one Muslim slave.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sahih Muslim 4345 - Narration of a military raid against a hapless tribe trying to reach their water hole. During the slaughter, the women and children attempt to flee, but are cut off and captured by the Muslims. This story refutes any misconception that Muhammad's sex slaves were taken by their own volition.

            Does Islam condone slavery? Does Islamic teaching allow Muslim men to keep women as sex slaves?
           </p>
           <p>
            Islam neither ignores nor condemns slavery. In fact, a large part of the Sharia is dedicated to the practice.
Muslims are encouraged to live in the way of Muhammad, who was a slave owner and trader. He captured slaves in battle; he had sex with his slaves; and he instructed his men to do the same. The Quran actually devotes more verses to making sure that Muslim men know they can keep women as sex slaves (4) than it does to telling them to pray five times a day (zero).

            hadith teaches to rape the women, the daughters make them your slaves, and slaughter the male children, (after raping). Bin Laden was a fake moslim if that's what he said.

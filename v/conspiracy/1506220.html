            Hey I'm back to tell you that maybe I was wrong. The Dead Sea Scrolls only validate that the bible was uncorrupted for a certain period of time. Check out

            That's false and the originals aren't even in Latin. Dead sea scrolls validated the authenticity of the bible. Cannot speak for other religious texts.

            Religion is a fucking virus caught early on. As soon as 5 years old if I'm not mistaken. Every major religion in the world teaches their children at that age, because they are at a stage where their brains are most malleable. Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with having existential questions, and searching for answers is what 'Spirituality' is all about. Nothing wrong with spirituality. However, most religions denounce common sense, ethics and of course proof (science), just so they can offer you hope for a better afterlife (or rebirth). This 'hope' is so twisted, people will just completely deny reality, and base their entire ethical principles or belief systems on a fucking book that has been rewritten a thousand times. Not to mention the intention of the book, often written by rulers throughout history (or as a form of compromise between different religions and leaders), to control the people. Some COULD argue that we need religion to have some sort of moral compass (ethics) within any society or a civilization, but even that isn't true with just a few critical thoughts and searching for answers. But hey, why would you do that when it's all plain to see and read in this fancy book, plus all the stories I told you of some fictional savior(s) to look up to, or demons to frighten you into submission, ever since you were a child?! Better to have a reassuring lie than an inconvenient truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck in your search for enlightenment. Be critical, not only of the information you digest, but also of who, how and why you think the way that you do.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.s. Try the 'Jesus Camp' documentary and come back to me if or when you're yelling at your monitor.

            This is a part of what I came to learn after many years of seeking answers. I encourage you to do your own research and do not believe anything they say to you. And of course, that includes me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humanity has been deceived and it is being controlled. All religions are intended to control humanity and its spirituality to some extent. All religious texts are based on lies. That doesn't mean you shouldn't believe there is a creator, but the mere idea of a God you have to worship is against humanity's freedom. The whole idea of a spiritual hierarchy and other people or "superior beings" telling you what you should or shouldn't do is against nature.
           </p>
           <p>
            And when I say a creator I don't mean a father of all human beings -that is a religious idea, but rather the source or origin of everything that exists. You have to differentiate between your natural inner spirituality, and the false religious ideas.

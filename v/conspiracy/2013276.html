Jews recognize how important media and propaganda is based on their dominance in Hollywood, so how are they trying to censor thought there?</p>
<p>While there are some instances of censorship on YouTube: as well as view count, like, and other manipulation by the thought-controllers there, YouTube is still one of the only mainstream commenting platforms that basically allows right wing thought to flourish. There are even outwardly pro-Nazi videos and comments all throughout the site. Don\'t get me wrong, this is a good thing as there are many great opportunities to find and drop some red-pills, but why is this the case? How much longer are (((they))) going to allow this state of affairs?</p>
<p>Pretty much every major social network has purged or is attempting to purge what they label as &quot;hate&quot; and censor &quot;extreme&quot; right-wing ideas. You\'re not going to find many popular &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; or similar comments on Facebook or other platforms, but you\'ll see serious posts like that all over YouTube. We all know that the right-wing is effectively banned from even formerly free-speech platforms like Reddit for instance, and they\'re basically looking for an excuse to get rid of The_Donald even though it\'s anti-Nazi, abhors racism, and mostly pro-Israel.</p>
<p>It\'s not as if YouTube doesn\'t want to promote a left-wing worldview.</p>
<ul>
<li>Earlier this year it instantly became a (((media issue))) basically overnight that YouTube was hosting politically incorrect content and has been trying to demonitize \'offensive\' videos. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-05/demonetization-youtube-fast-underway-dissidents-will-be-silenced">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-05/demonetization-youtube-fast-underway-dissidents-will-be-silenced</a></li>
<li>Laura Southern and others are being banned from Patreon. Patreon is one of the better ways to get funding if you\'re a creator. They allow pro-antifa accounts to fund there and are apparently slowly moving to ban some right-leaning creators. </li>
<li>YouTube\'s CEO is Susan Wojcicki who is trying to use her position to enact SJW approved social change: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAyJKrOpGVk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAyJKrOpGVk</a></li>
<li>They\'re trying to push this YouTube Creators for Change program which is basically a collection of mostly muslims and other people who hate whites. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/creators-for-change/creators.html">https://www.youtube.com/yt/creators-for-change/creators.html</a></li>
<li>In recent weeks they\'ve been pushing lots of weird pro-tranny and pro-immigration videos. These videos had very high production values. They obviously took some major effort to create and were roundly excoriated by the internet. This has to be pretty disappointing to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically what I\'m asking is simple:</p>
<p>1) why are the Jews letting YouTube remain up like this?</p>
<p>2) how long will it remain relatively free?</p>
<p>3) could they using JewTube as some sort of honeypot to identify people who engage in wrong-think? With the amount of data they have about people, this is a good way for them to identify their opponents. Before you think this is crazy, communists have murdered millions time and time again, they\'re not going to hesitate to do it again. I think Mao specially allowed total free speech for a brief time as a trap to identify intellectuals and others against him.</p>
<p>4) in the event that youtube does ever become very censored, what alternative video hosting sites exist that are relatively free? Vimeo seems pretty cucked. Vid.me showed some promise but somebody as innocuous as Styx had some complaints about them and political censorship: <a href="https://vid.me/gMNIm">https://vid.me/gMNIm</a></p>',

            I thought that YouTube was surprisingly free and uncensored and open despite their political leanings, but they were apparently working behind the scenes and moved surprisingly quick.

            Let the historical record show that the communists moved very quickly once they felt a sliver of an opening.

            They are censoring Lauren Southern, Mark Dice, and a few other conservatives/rational thinkers. Other companies that censor conservatives:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Patreon
            </li>
            <li>
             Imgur.com
            </li>
            <li>
             Facebook
            </li>
            <li>
             Snapchat
            </li>
            <li>
             Reddit
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            And all these sites above continue to support racism against whites. Google even changed its definition of "fascist" to include the term "right wing", when I can't find any other dictionary online that uses "right wing" in the definition of "fascism".

            Because Google was founded and is owned by jews and YouTube is 100% controlled in EVERY FUCKING WAY. How new are you? They shadowban ALL comments with outgoing links or statements they don’t like, they take down videos they don’t like, and they falsify both view numbers and voting patterns.

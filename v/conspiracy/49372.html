            What a load of drivel. It requires the reader to completely disregard
            <em>
             everything
            </em>
            officially stated. Then why stop at a zionist conspiracy? Using the same argumentation, it could have been the lizardmen or the atlanteans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still... Something irked me yesterday, lessons we learned ourselves here in Norway after initially thinking the white supremacy attack on Oslo by Breivik was a jihad operation. Yesterday I heard a lot of the interviews personally as I understand danish. Nobody specifically stated "arabic" but that it was an "unknown language". So that doesn't prove that it was a religious/political attack done by an muslim. Yet it doesn't disprove it and far from point the finger at zionists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's go through the arguments as they are put forward in the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            The argument that the person pictured isn't dark-skinned is stupid. There are light-skinned muslims and even european convertites who have gone to ISIS to fight a holy war. Skin-colour can be used to generalize, not pinpoint.
           </p>
           <p>
            The argument that there were two dark dressed gunmen when there in fact seems to be one, dressed in black isn't really a strong point either. Assuming that the police present returned fire (confirmed) and assuming they were neutrally dressed in dark suites there
            <em>
             were
            </em>
            several dark dressed people shooting. Making mistakes in a situation like that is supposedly common and it's been scientifically proven that witnesses aren't 100% reliable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The name-business is ridiculous. Prejudging anybody based on names is idiotic. Hussein Obama anybody? I used the wondermachine called "google" and swedish baptism records suggest that on the 29. of May 1796 a woman called Anna Christina Sonberg was christened at Ivetofta Church, Sweden. Clearly a swedish jew name...
           </p>
           <p>
            The tight security consisted to my knowledge of two uniformed officers and some undercover cops and body-guards and the gunman reportedly didn't go that far into the complex. So much for the super-tight security that had to be an inside job to get around...
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the author argues that there's an overkill of police precense at the terror scene and refers to a picture of three police-cars, one firetruck and an amulance. What an overkill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding the picture that "proves" that it's a hoax, a policeofficer on a stretcher with no visible blood... One of the officers was shot in the groin. No officers where life-threatningly hurt. Don't expect Michael Bay-style fallout.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that's all the ammount of energy I'll ever spend on the "jew conspiracy" in relations to this event until
            <em>
             anything remotely tangible
            </em>
            suggests that this was a zionist false flag.

                 <strong>
                  At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the JFK assassination wherein Mrs Kennedy's voice was clearly heard calling "hello Coretta" followed by a volley of gunfire.
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 The presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King, he played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago .. although he was feted and fabulized by the same ppl who propounded the LHO lone assassin scenario there was no money the black ---- was broke.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place read George HW Bush, and asked for dough to be told there was none, so he chanced his arm at blackmail presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas .. he laughed him off.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Where after some short time later on April 4, 1968 Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis, we will say GHW Bush shot him for attempted blackmail.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That in reprisal LK's antecedents took time out at the August 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his and Coretta's involvement, and that the ultra police violence blamed on

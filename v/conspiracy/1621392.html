           . So the biggest secret the elites are keeping from us is that time is not actually linear. The whole point of our programming starting with MKUltra and the Beatles is to lock us in a permanent state of complacency where we think patience and hard work eventually leads to something good, it's all a lie to to turn us into pacified pussies. The elites understand that the current NOW we're living in is the only reality. "History" was created so we look towards the "past' to know what's possible. It's all to take away our most basic human psychic power of intuition, where you "know" something is true but don't have the logical connections to understand why. Our reality right now is basically ground-hog day, they show us the movie to think wow that's crazy that everyday's the same, my day's are always "slightly" different. Reality is constructed anew on a daily basis, these freaks have the keys to consciousness and they're using the secrets so we create our own shitty lives on anew on a daily basis.

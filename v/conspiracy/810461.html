            Two things I could imagine. One, he has some kind of mental disorder and he's so delusional, he legitimately believes what he's saying so I'd imagine passing a lie detector test would be easy. He might have been a brilliant scientist, but one day he could have just snapped all Beautiful Mind like and spiraled.

            Second is a bit more conspiratorial. As soon as he went public, the government wiped his records to discredit his claims so people would just pass him off as a lunatic.

            This man is obviously very intelligent and extremely scientifically literate. His speaking style is perfect for explaining complex topics that have many facets that all need to be addressed before the audience can be expected to understand the subject matter. Having said this I still don't buy the story he is weaving because I am also very scientifically literate. Many of his explanations of real-life, human technologies are spot on. Furthermore, some of the ideas his story is based on such as the so call island of stability in the higher atomic number ranges is also very possible. However, his story begins to brake down when he moves past the real life science that he is so good at explaining and starts to make up plausible sounding scientific explanations.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few examples of this would be his statements about the theory that gravity is a wave or it is the result of a particle called a graviton. At this point he claims the graviton is nonsense and goes on to explain about gravity A and gravity B. For me this is an all too obvious point where he diverges from real science that acts as the base for his story and moves into the fake part. Every type of matter and energy, absolutely everything, light, quarks, leptons, elections, bosons, everything is both a particle AND a wave, at the same time. This fact is not in dispute. While it is true that we have hard evidence for the existence of gravity waves, we also have confirmed the existence of the Higgs-boson, which is the particle that communicates mass and is a major step forward in discovering the illusive graviton. We may not have found the graviton yet, but with every other particle we have ever discovered all being simultaneously particle and wave, why should we believe that it is nonsense that a graviton should be responsible for gravity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, his explanation for gravity A and B is also a dead give away for me. His claims that we have mislabeled gravity A as the strong nuclear force is simply wrong. We understand and have identified the particle(s) that communicate the strong force, they are called the w and z bosons. Furthermore we understand the method by which the w and z bosons communicate the strong force to the particles that they hold together. I have provided an excellent, if somewhat heady, youtube video to help explain this very complex subject further.
           </p>

             https://youtu.be/6uGZdo-fsjI?t=242
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, while his explanation of for how antimatter is produced was pleasingly well thought out, I still see no reason why 100% of the mass of element-116 would brake down into antimatter. If any antimatter was produced at all it would be very rare by comparison such as is the case in the potassium-40 isotope, and the rest would brake down into lighter elements via alpha, beta, or gamma decay. This decay would still release energy, most of which in the form of gamma-ray photons, but it would do so just like every other known radioactive element.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, this man is very intelligent, and very scientifically literate, and he used that literacy to build a seemingly plausible base for his fiction. I'm not personally concerned with his reasons for doing so, but only that his explanations don't hold up to critical scrutiny.

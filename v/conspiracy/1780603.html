            I don't know what I do believe, or think, but...

           <p>
            I certainly do not believe or think any longer that DJT is some affable billionaire who stumped his way to the presidency by being a real man of the people. These months have only confirmed by thinking that there are almost no uncontrolled options left for humanity.

            i don't believe a sharp nyc billionaire would think for a moment that assad pulled off the gas attack.  plus he must know 9-11 was an inside job. i don't believe though that he is in full control so many questions.

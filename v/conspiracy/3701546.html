<p>And here for some more information:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/">http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/</a></p>
<p><strong>So our setting is on October 18, 2019 John Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic simulation event about a new coronavirus. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and World Economic Forum were large sponsors of this event.</strong></p>
<p>Besides following a similar flow of events virus makes jumps from animals in a developing country, governments too slow to respond, etc there are some interesting connections. (This is what the mainstream media tells us).</p>
<p><strong>Lets first look at the school involved in hosting this event:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Bloomberg_School_of_Public_Health">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Bloomberg_School_of_Public_Health</a></p>
<p>Originally named the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the school was founded in 1916 by William H. Welch with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
<p>The school was renamed the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on April 20, 2001 in honor of Michael Bloomberg for his financial support and commitment to the school and Johns Hopkins University. Bloomberg has donated a total of $2.9 billion to Johns Hopkins University over a period of several decades.</p>
<p><strong>Bloomberg also just dumped 500 million into an election campaign against Donald Trump.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Event 201 itself was funded by Open Philanthropy Project who define how they works as: &quot;We typically recommend grants to the Open Philanthropy Project fund, a donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation</strong>.&quot; </p>
<p>On December 18, 2012, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which at the time of the donation were worth a total of about $500 million.</p>
<p><strong>So we see so far you have educational institutions, big tech, and big money families coalescing.</strong></p>
<p>People invited to Event 201 and attended <a href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/index.html:">http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/index.html:</a>

<p>The two scariest members on this list are bolded.</p>

<p>Christopher Elias - President of the Global Development Program, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>Tim Evans - Former Senior Director of the Health, Nutrition and Population Global Practice at the World Bank Group.</p>
<p><strong>George Gao - Director-General, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Avril Haines - A Senior Research Scholar at Columbia University. Dr. Haines served as Assistant to the President and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor for Barrack Obama. She also served as the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama in 2013 and Legal Adviser to the National Security Council.</strong></p>
<p>High ranking asscoiates of Johnson and Johnson, Lufthansa, the UPS Foundation, the US CDC, WEF, NBC Universal Media </p>
<p>Check out George Gao the head of the Chinese CDC who was in attendance of this event, speaking on the opening of a BSL-4 biolab in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>&quot;It will offer more opportunities for Chinese researchers, and our contribution on the BSL4-level pathogens will benefit the world,&quot; says George Gao, director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Key Laboratory of Pathogenic Microbiology and Immunology in Beijing.</p>

<p>You now have a group of people who planned the response to a fake pandemic that focused on same root strain of virus that we are seeing just three months after the initial event. One of these people helped open a level 4 bio facility in the initial epicenter of the disease. How do you have the US CIA so close to a &quot;random&quot; pandemic. What is that 1 or 2 degrees of separation from this very event? Look at what it achieved - the sinking of the economy, a last ditch effort after the Russia Collusion Hoax, the Syrian Chemical attack, the Iran WW3, and Ukraine Hoax all fizzled out. How surprising this now occurs, who could have seen it coming? These people could... funny how that works. There are way too many coincidences going on here. In the end God wins, so I hope the people responsible for this mass panic like eternal darkness and gnashing of teeth because there is a special place in Hell for them. In the end I don\'t think many will die from this thing maybe 100,000, maybe more but I think this thing will follow the Swine Flu model.</p>',

            CIA Project ZEPHR, using bio-engineered weapons or power outages as a weapon against dissent. Combined with Project POGO, used to identify, categorize, and track all critical thinking individuals who would distrust or question authority using "Gate Keepers" (think YouTube celebs like Joe Rogan, or entire walled garden platforms.. like VOAT).

           <p>
            These two combined would be quite effective at identifying anyone who isn't with the current jew-controlled program, and then getting rid of them.

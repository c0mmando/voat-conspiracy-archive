<p>The entire political system is a joke. So much of a joke I will not even talk about it other than the fact that it\'s a major stage show.

<p>It\'s a huge mind game, once you realize it\'s a bunch of shit and you are all that matters you win.

Ask a question like that and you\'re ridiculed for being &quot;negative.&quot; A bunch of ignorant people roam the earth and I just hope people wake up sooner rather than later.

             I'd beg to differ, our world is pretty close to trashed. They are pumping chemicals into the ground to extract water. Our cities will be in ruin in 100 years because they have been built with materials that deteriorate rapidly. The water all over the USA and on the earth for that matter is wildly infected with lead, fluoride and god knows what else. All of our food is being GMO'd. It's a pretty sad state the world is in. I am not saying we can't reverse it, but humans would have to wake up first.

              I agree with most of your environmental points but there's nothing wrong with GMOs,theyre naturally occurring. However, we do have an issue with corrupt companies patenting their own gmos for greed and poisoning our foods.

               Pretty sure GMOs are by definition altered by humans in a lab. Some farmer crossing pears and apples is all good by me, but when they start splicing fish DNA to make UV reactive rasins.... thats where I draw the line.

              The water has also been tainted with radiation from fukushima. Deforestation is an issue as far as health is concerned, giving us oxygen and all, but honestly that is drops in the bucket compared to plankton. If I recall correctly, the

              give us the vast majority of our oxygen, something like 60% or so.

              At any rate, we are more then capable, as a species, of generating electricity in a manner that is not lethal to the planet as a whole, or the species on it.

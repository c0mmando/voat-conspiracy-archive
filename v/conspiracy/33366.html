<p>Regarding the John Kennedy assassination, no less than the 1968 murder of his brother US Senator Robert Kennedy, two conspiracies exist side by side, the primary group for the Texas slaying includes the still living Abraham Bolden, GHW Bush, Jim Lehrer formerly of PBS News and Alex Jones\' CIA op sire.</p>
<p>The secondary conspirators are all those newshounds, political commentators, and CIA plants who turn from the evidence, like they turn from <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/1g7utg/israeli_premier_netanyahu_warns_of_another/cbqht6c">911 truth</a> and <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/1gtjq7/another_holocaust_c_fraud_exposed_holocaust_hero/canwsg8">Holocaust truth</a></p>
<p>Both conspiracies are capital offenses, means naysayers at every level in the US political and news dissemination apparatus, who talk bullsh*t re <a href="http://s017.radikal.ru/i406/1307/61/ee6fe6c7128f.png">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> for instance.</p>
<p>Will be required to explain their reticence in a duly appointed capital court, convened under the auspices of the US Justice Department, in proceedings that will be expected to result in the handing down of thousands of death sentences!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MacNeil\'s testimony has been used to prop up the official story ever since, he remained with the motorcade and says he heard a single shot then two more in quick succession.</p>
<p>He says he went into the portal of the TSBD, where he encountered a young man he subsequently identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, who he says directed him to the nearest phone. Lehrer says he stayed at Love Field outside of Dallas with Air Force One.</p>
<p>The computer enhancement of the Moorman shot, as well as identifying shooters E Howard Hunt and Dallas cop Joe Smith, and the presence of Andy Warhol and the Martin Luther Kings man &amp; wife.</p>
<p>Reveals about twenty <a href="http://i031.radikal.ru/1309/dc/1f7b8b4c9046.jpg">muzzle flashes</a>, including Smith\'s shot from the corner of the Rotunda Wall, and the &quot;Oliver Stone&quot; flash from further along the fence line.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the assassination..</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wherein Mrs Kennedy\'s voice was clearly heard calling &quot;hello Coretta&quot; followed by a volley of gunfire, the presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>He played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.</p>
<p>That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime, until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>Where after some short time later Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire, while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis.</p>
<p>Although he was feted and fabulized by the same Jew press refused the evidence located him with the shooters, that propounded the Lee Harvey Oswald / lone assassin scenario, there was no money the black ---- was broke.</p>
<p>He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place, read George HW Bush and asked for dough to be told there was none.</p>
<p>So he chanced his arm at blackmail, presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas, he laughed him off.</p>
<p>So Luther King took time out at the 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his own involvement, and was shot down for it! <a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/vb/showthread.php?680-The-Assassination-of-John-F-Kennedy-Expanded&amp;p=1826#post1826">The Assassination of John F Kennedy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Including evidence from the Los Angeles Coroner that the shots that killed Robert Kennedy, were fired from a distance of between one and three inches into his head, from behind and below his right ear.</p>
<p>Sirhan Sirhan who was convicted for the killing was several feet to his front, the film has footage of the LA DA simply brushing that aside .. Security Guard <a href="http://obscurantist.com/wp-content/uploads/thane-eugene-cesar.jpg">Thane Eugene Cesar</a> is thought to have fired the fatal shots!</p>

<p><strong>Update ..</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://jfkmurdersolved.com/toshfiles.htm">CIA Pilot Tosh Plumlee</a> admits being in Dealey Plaza when President Kennedy was shot, he says he piloted an aircraft into Dallas that day, yet has failed to disclose who his passengers were, and whether anything he knows ties in with the presence of the Luther Kings and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>There were at least twenty shooters on the GK .. count E Howard Hunt and the other tramps Charles Harrelson and Charles Frederick Rogers, with Dallas cop Joe Smith, former PBS NewsHour host Jim Lehrer, George HW Bush and Alex Jones admitted CIA op sire as seven .. maybe Tosh Plumlee was another!</p>',

            MacNeil's testimony has been used to prop up the official story ever since, he remained with the motorcade and says he heard a single shot then two more in quick succession.

            He says he went into the portal of the TSBD, where he encountered a young man he subsequently identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, who he says directed him to the nearest phone. Lehrer says he stayed at Love Field outside of Dallas with Air Force One.

            At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the assassination..

          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Wherein Mrs Kennedy's voice was clearly heard calling "hello Coretta" followed by a volley of gunfire, the presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King.
           </p>
           <p>
            He played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.
           </p>
           <p>
            That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime, until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where after some short time later Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire, while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Although he was feted and fabulized by the same Jew press refused the evidence located him with the shooters, that propounded the Lee Harvey Oswald / lone assassin scenario, there was no money the black ---- was broke.
           </p>
           <p>
            He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place, read George HW Bush and asked for dough to be told there was none.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he chanced his arm at blackmail, presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas, he laughed him off.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Luther King took time out at the 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his own involvement, and was shot down for it!

           admits being in Dealey Plaza when President Kennedy was shot, he says he piloted an aircraft into Dallas that day, yet has failed to disclose who his passengers were, and whether anything he knows ties in with the presence of the Luther Kings and Andy Warhol.
          </p>
          <p>
           There were at least twenty shooters on the GK .. count E Howard Hunt and the other tramps Charles Harrelson and Charles Frederick Rogers, with Dallas cop Joe Smith, former PBS NewsHour host Jim Lehrer, George HW Bush and Alex Jones admitted CIA op sire as seven .. maybe Tosh Plumlee was another!

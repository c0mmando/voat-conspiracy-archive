            During the Bush years there were so many conflicting reports about Osama Bin Laden. Then, Bush didn't care where he was. I also remember seeing images and even videos of the deaths of Saddam Hussein, his sons, and other terrorist leaders as well but there is nothing to see here. Hersh seems credible and I think more information might come out of him. Another thing I remember that over the years it was reported that Bin Laden had a debilitating illness, and that's why I find this account of the raid to be weird:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Three Seals came up those stairs, scanning different angles, searching while protecting each other. According to one of the Seals, the first man up spotted a tall, bearded, swarthy man in a prayer cap wearing traditional flowing Pakistani clothes, the knee-length shirt worn over pyjama-like bottoms. One or more of the Seals fired at him. The man retreated quickly into a bedroom and the Seals followed. In the bedroom they found two women leaning over a fatally wounded Bin Laden, who had been shot in the head. The first Seal violently moved the women out of the way and the other two stood over him and fired several more shots into his chest.
            </p>
            <p>
             The engagement was over in seconds. Amal had been shot in the leg. Bin Laden had weapons on a shelf in his bedroom but had not picked them up. His identity was unmistakable, even with the grotesque hole through his right forehead.

            I was initially on the fence with this story, because initial internet rumors were saying that Hersh only had 1 anonymous source. As it turns out, from
            <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/05/11/everything_we_know_about_the_death_of_osama_bin_laden_is_wrong/">
             this Salon article
            </a>
            , he has 1 retired senior intelligence official, 2 consultants to SOC and a named retired Pakistani General, Asad Durrani. This story certainly has more teeth than I originally thought, although we may never know when or how Bin Laden died. This could be yet another cover story to implicate Pakistan for whatever new political/foreign policy agenda. I'm curious what other people think about the veracity (or lack thereof) of this breaking news.

             Alt media reported on this shit a half decade ago.  The story goes deeper than even Hersh is getting into, the raid wasn't just fake the last 15 years have been, Osama Bin Laden is the real life equivalent of Emmanuel Goldstein from 1984.

              Also, I think it's important to note that Hersh is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War. The fact that he is so credible is what is so damning, IMO.

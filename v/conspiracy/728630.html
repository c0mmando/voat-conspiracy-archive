            college is slowly becoming a scam 
if everyone has a college degree its going to lower the overall quality of the college graduate over time.

            College
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            is a good idea for a few different reasons, though the cost of it is underplayed.
           </p>
           <p>
            College prices only went up after the availability of scholarships and student loans increased. At this point paying face value for college is questionable- only if you're rich enough should you.
           </p>
           <p>
            But is it a person's fault for being enslaved to debt? Yes. Don't brush off a class' irresponsibility like it's an enormous plan for enslavement when they brought it on themselves. Have you ever tried to teach someone fiscal responsibility? Sometimes it feels easier to watch them bury themselves.

            Anyways I'm happy to see my comment angered you enough and your lack of education has you referring to a short paragraph as a book report.

           <p>
            I do agree to your point on how far America has fallen to have elected a treasonous unfit nigger to our presidency merely based on the color of his skin rather than the content of his character.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet let's face it, our silent partners to the north while not drinking maple syrup make it their national passed time to apologize to people. Canada the original cucks. Canucks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway nice chatting with younwhile adding no discussion to the topic at hand because you can't even properly insult someone. Enjoy sharia law, after your police force continue to be murdered in the streets by crazy goat fuckers with pocket knifes.

            I was pushed into college by my parents, I was young and I didn't really know better, I got a useless degree and tons of debt...More than 10 years later, it's almost paid off. I'm a self-taught programmer, not using my degree...I really wish I knew then what I know now. College is a fucking rip off.

            Hmm seems to be in line with the average salary in canada.

           <p>
            Puts me well above the average income for americans. Not sure if those are single wages or family income listed, as I search around it seems the average family income is 53k, thats two people working.
           </p>
           <p>
            This brings me to another question, why the fuck you rich ass Canadians always coming to America if you make this much more than us?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also to your pointed insult, no 52k is no where near the poverty line in canada. And no I post not to brag as you put it, I was adding to the previous posters statement of earning a trade as opposed to going to college for a fraction of the cost while staying competitive in salary, and in many cases making more than a degree will get you.
           </p>
           <p>
            But hey you're  just a faggot cucked Canadian so I'll just sit back holding my guns and laughing while moslems and niggers kill you and take over your country.

            It is a race to the bottom.  The average person is now expected to take on debt for a degree that should give them a higher chance to ask for more money for their jobs.   The market becomes so saturated with college degree workers that it devalues the college degree requirement.   This helps business as they no longer have to provide on the job training/provide better working standards as well as maintain on paper a higher standard of worker.   Except at no risk for the business while the risks and costs are associated on the worker.   While being in debt and having to pay for their college they have less power to be able to ask for higher pay because they will get fired while someone else with the same degree or better will do the job for less.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have less power to contract a higher pay, bypassing unionized or decent wage living.

             The corporations then outsource the management and risk of having employees on their business ledgers by hiring a workforce through another corporation who then pays half or oftentimes less than half of what they get paid for the employee to the human being at the end of the chain.

             Then when the state tax break ends they close shop, lay everyone off and open another shop in a state which is offering a better tax break for those who bring lots of jobs in.
            </p>
            <p>
             With all the "Right to work" states for corporations to choose from, the power of the working class to negotiate has disintegrated in a cloud of self-destructive greed.

            People don't ask their kids to work while in highschool, so after they graduate children are still children. Parents still have to work AND they were taught that college is the way to go if you want a good job. Parents want good jobs for their children and now have kids at the house 24/7. College will keep them occupied and hopefully score them success in the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Colleges know this. This is why tuition has become so ungodly expensive while they now teach the shit kids should have learned in highschool. It is a scam. Make your kid get a job in highschool and start saving. Teach them to be self sufficient. Encourage them to think and plan for themselves. Be good parents. Don't let your kids end up like the punk-ass kids in college right now.

            everyone was screaming "go to college" because the u. s. government backed trillions of dollars of private loans thru sallie mae legislation.  it was designed to be a "bubble" that would add to and replace the fannie mae housing bubble that made big banks trillions of dollars.

            The majority of people saying that mean that you should go to college so you can earn a degree and get a job with that degree, as opposed to just doing entry level jobs and what not. Its not the only way, that is certain, but most dont have a deeper connection to the illuminati and all that shit that want you to fuck your life up. My advice isnt to go to college, its to find what you want to do and do it. Though, before considering a crazy plan like going to college for 12 years to be a geneticist, think of learning a trade at a trade school. Cabinetmaking, carpentry, electrician stuff like wire laying, small or diesel engine mechanics, the world will ALWAYS need those workers. The world wont always need a master of art and womens studies. Not that any of us would go in for a dumb fcking major like those though :P

              A select few do, for the rest that can't, or those that don't want the headaches, as things stand you work. That work, typically has a retarded college degree requirement, even when it does not have to, why? We're too efficient, there isn't enough work for everyone and that is only going to get worse. So businesses need  away to thin the applicant heard, slapping college degree on all jobs makes far fewer people apply.

              I used to work for myself, had 2 employees, fuck that, the stress of it all was not worth the money, that I never had time to spend anyways.

              Ask the people who skipped out on college then failed at whatever they were trying to do what the better option is, there are FAR ore of them than the ones who tried and succeeded.

            Why not? Educated people are less likely to become criminal (correlation at least) and are definitely less likely to be radicalized. They care more for the environment and are thinking long term.

             See, there's where you're wrong. I took one stat class in college. I know that "correlation does not equal causation". I could provide you
             <em>
              fifty
             </em>
             counter examples which rely on missing variables. Now, I assume you're an educated person, from a developed country. And yet, you'll post an undocumented, largely imaginary "statistic" -- which isn't even philosophically relevant.

             Wanna know how I know you've never studied in the Middle East? The Muslim Brotherhood recruited from students. The student population has been the breeding ground for rabble-rousers worldwide. Just because this hasn't been true in Europe since... what 1968? France would say '68.

            <p>
             I'm dumbfounded. I'm not certain that "care for the environment" is a moral good, and not a "platform of partisan dogma". Remember this: (nearly) every petrochemical engineer went to college. So did the people whose (unsustainable) industry causes environmental disasters. Bhopal was not developed by HS drop-outs.

            However generally speaking even as long as the machines need maintenance by people who will have to be more and more educated to know how to handle the machines, so its gonna be college/ university after all.

            There is one major pitfall that most people overlook, and that plays into the American corporatocracy:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Student-Loan Debt. Large debt—and the fear it creates—is a pacifying force. There was no tuition at the City University of New York when I attended one of its colleges in the 1970s, a time when tuition at many U.S. public universities was so affordable that it was easy to get a B.A. and even a graduate degree without accruing any student-loan debt. While those days are gone in the United States, public universities continue to be free in the Arab world and are either free or with very low fees in many countries throughout the world. The millions of young Iranians who risked getting shot to protest their disputed 2009 presidential election, the millions of young Egyptians who risked their lives earlier this year to eliminate Mubarak, and the millions of young Americans who demonstrated against the Vietnam War all had in common the absence of pacifying huge student-loan debt.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Today in the United States, two-thirds of graduating seniors at four-year colleges have student-loan debt, including over 62 percent of public university graduates. While average undergraduate debt is close to $25,000, I increasingly talk to college graduates with closer to $100,000 in student-loan debt. During the time in one’s life when it should be easiest to resist authority because one does not yet have family responsibilities, many young people worry about the cost of bucking authority, losing their job, and being unable to pay an ever-increasing debt. In a vicious cycle, student debt has a subduing effect on activism, and political passivity makes it more likely that students will accept such debt as a natural part of life.

              By the time they become despondent they usually have other dependents (children, spouses, etc) to take care of, and that keeps them pacified. The trick is to not become overwhelmed with debt, which is hard to do even without involving secondary education.

            Trades can easily pay as well as a BS, with a tenth of the debt.
You will have a pay cap, but a lot of people can't even get jobs in the fields they went to school for.

             I took a two weekend 4 day class to get a cdl license. The class cost 1k. I got a job the next week making 52k a year, I'm a high school dropout.
            </p>
            <p>
             How people get into 100k+ debt and a worthless degree for a job making sub 30k boggles my mind.

              Good on ya! A guy I know was working a service station, got sick of it, did a rail safety course for about $1000, applied for and became a freight train driver! Guy makes nearly 100k a year, tough job though.

              I myself quit school part way through year 11, got a trade, stuck it out for four years, and am on decent money with low stress and excellent hours. Also 100% debt free!

            Would you support a push for university attendance if it were free/ tax payed?

            Here in Germany I can definitely understand people pushing children to go to uni over learning a craft, since these kinds of jobs may not last for much longer. If a machine is faster, cheaper and better at making chairs on its own there is no need for a carpenter anymore. Only for a design-student to create a blueprint for the machine.

            In a few years we will no longer need truck and taxi drivers. Only educated people who are able to coordinate trucks and taxis.

            Colleges aren't just a breeding group for the next generation of the .01% but serves as indoctrination for everyone else. The average person is generally told they are too stupid or poor to go to college, but do it anyway. These careers don't provide what anyone is looking for. No matter what you do, if you do it the way the world wants, you are looking at years upon years of back breaking work for a reward that consists of doing the same thing over and over and over (get a car, get married, get a house).

             Honestly this is why people should just look inward and really figure out what it is they want to do to contribute to society instead of making decisions based on what other people expect, or just blending in along with the herd. When was the last time being part of the herd benefited those people? Probably at a peaceful protest or revolution of some kind would masses be actually steered towards a better cause.

             I hope younger people these days who are still in high school and plan on going to college wake up soon, en masse, and realize that the world isn't what they thought it was. There are some of us who have been through that kind of education system and have degrees and cannot get jobs, let alone with decent pay right away. It seems the way everything is set up right now is very eugenic and unforgiving if you don't have the support from friends and family.

             Agreed. We're led to believe that college and schooling will get us somewhere. That it will bring us success, and possibly fulfillment. In the end, it just makes us slaves. Obviously this is not the case for everyone, but it's a real issue. We are brainwashed. Might be a stretch, but it reminds me of this

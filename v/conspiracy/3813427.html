<p>Every time the topic comes up, the flat earther will dutifully be downvoted, some pigeon will come shit on the chess board with a lame and tired argument like “If the earth is flat why can’t I fall off the edge and why does a ship go over the horizon RETARD,” passers-by will see the downvoted at play and assume that order is being upheld, and “science” is winning out against this deviant flat-earth heretic. </p>
<p>So I got to thinking, what made me ultimately begin to question the earth being a spinning globe? It wasn’t until a couple years after doing all my moon landings research that I was able to finally entertain some of the truly interesting arguments i was hearing. For example, you just can’t ignore that NASA uses <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/aqs5dm.jpeg">obviously photoshopped</a> and inconsistent images of the globe rather than just presenting raw video of a globe from space. </p>
<p>But here is where you begin to enter the debate over what constitutes “proof” and how to reason your way into a tentative scientific “belief.” All the authority and resources are on the side of the globe. No one is allowed to go to space or Antarctica and few people have the equipment or conditions to carry out experiments that can confirm or disprove curvature, let alone the means of presenting their work online via video or PowerPoint. </p>
<p>For me, I began to notice the sheer one-sidedness of the argument, and how despite not seeing good proof of a spinning globe, real video of satellites in space, a live steam from the moon, and uncut boarding of the ISS, an uncut video of leaving earth’s atmosphere all the way up until seeing the earth as a ball, uncut videos of flybys of other planets, panoramic camera views of outer space or on a space walk at the ISS, and all the other many videos that there should be if outer space is real and if NASA really does get $50 million per day to explore it, despite there not being that smoking gun undeniable proof to shut up flat earthers..... people obviously want them to shut up anyway. </p>
<p>Flat Earth is one of the most heavily censored topics on YouTube. It is one of the most manipulated search results on Google. In any thread that mentions flat earth there seems to be an internet shill on deck ready to uncork their scripted talking points or (what a coincidence) claim that they have done an experiment to prove the globe, and even though they can’t prove they did it, you’re retarded because you haven’t done it yourself. </p>
<p>The massive amount of unreasonable hostility and censorship is truly cloying, and so heavy-handed that it finally made me begin to wonder if those crazy flat earthers had a point. If you look at it objectively, it becomes clear that you’re not seeing an honest debate, but a frantic effort to censor and delete. </p>
<p>So with such a one-sided and unfair setup with flat earth info being suppressed and pro-globe propaganda being gilded with all the authority and fake dignity the internet can muster, the only person you can really prove something this ground-breaking to is..... yourself. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the Flat Earth Challenge! It is very simple, free, and only will take you 2 weeks. All it requires is an open mind — I mean really an intentionally and deliberately open mind — and a smart phone app. Here it is:</p>
<p>For <strong>two (2) weeks</strong> you must </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flat-earth-sun-moon-zodiac/id1440996640">Flat Earth Sun Moon and Zodiac app</a>.  Not only is it a cool visualization of the seasons and map as time passes, whether you’re a flat earther or not, but it also comes with a “video of the day” feature with a link to a different flat earth video every day — not the super long ones either from what I understand. Your job, for 2 weeks, is to <strong>watch that video every day.</strong> Thats it, just watch the curated videos with an open mind. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For those two weeks, you must also <strong>suppose the earth is flat and outer space is fake</strong> and simultaneously pay attention to all media you experience, whether it’s tv, movies, music, video games, newspaper, and even the wording of scripts you hear on news reports, etc. Pay careful attention to how many times someone <strong>mentions</strong> a globe, or the words “global” or “globally.” Pay attention to how many globes you see on the tv screen, even in commercials. Observe how many times space is mentioned or a graphic about space is shown. Keeping in mind that every visual representation of space you see is fabricated, computer generated, or stylized in some way, notice how many times you are shown this concocted visualization of outer space, even if it is just a graphic of a planet in a tv commercial or something like that. Ask yourself how often outer space is being mentioned, or <strong>suggested,</strong> without actually being <strong>shown.</strong> Since you are pretending space is fake and the earth is flat, you will most likely notice what appears to be a huge effort to <strong>mentally condition</strong> people and <strong>reinforce</strong> the globe and outer space illusions in all kinds of various media. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, just for example, I’ve been listening to the Sirius XM David Bowie channel which is only available this month, and so much of that interesting character’s music and imagery is about space. The point of the second part of this challenge is to begin to realize that if not for the concept of outer space and spinning balls being constantly deployed in fictional media, it wouldn’t be real in our minds. </p>
<p>Take the challenge! It’s easy and costs nothing. I look forward to hearing your experiences should you decide to take this simple challenge.</p>',

            I asked the same thing. Voaters understand how Jews control almost all institutions including all education but NASA? No way, it's gentile controlled. It's SCIENCE... even though all famous scientists are typically freemasons... They're known to be completely honest people.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to understand that most people are subliminally programmed and will reject flat earth without even considering it. I was the same way, laughed it off. Personally, I went out and did my own experiments. I'm in the aviation field so I have the opportunity to fly in an aircraft constantly. Took a while but I had to admit that flat earthers were right. Good on you. Keep in mind that this post will be downvoted to hell. I wouldn't try to convince anyone on voat about flat earth.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 things to avoid on Voat: flat earth and trannys. Not talking about good things about trannys of course but, that most people in power are trannys.

             Why can everyone south of the equator see the exact same stars rotating in the same direction around the same fixed central point in the sky due south of them if they’re supposedly all looking in different directions?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why are the distances between degrees of latitude uniform and don’t grow exponentially away from the equator?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why does everyone on Earth get the same result for the Eratosthenes experiment, when people nearer the equator should get a much smaller circumference for the Earth than those nearer the poles?
            </li>
            <li>
             Come to think of it, was Eratosthenes part of the “round Earth” conspiracy?
            </li>
            <li>
             Surviving records show that the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians based their astronomical forecasts on calculations assuming the Earth is a globe. Did this conspiracy begin at the dawn of civilization, or are all ancient artifacts nothing but Victorian forgeries? If so, why has this never been detected by modern carbon-dating techniques?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why do arc lengths of given angles of longitude decrease rather than increase south of the equator?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why does the sun not rise in the northeast and set in the northwest, year round, for everyone on Earth?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why DOES the sun set, when the law of perspective states that the angular size of the sun’s altitude, like everything else, can’t become negative?
            </li>
            <li>
             Why does the sun’s angular size not change throughout the day or year, since it is “moving toward and away from us” and is “closer than we’re told”?
            </li>
            <li>
             Seriously, did you fall asleep during geometry class, or are you just completely demented?

             If you believe in zeteticism, why do you keep relying on magical and unprovable solutions, which can’t be shown to exist with your own eyes and clearly don’t exist at all? Apparently, zeteticism is just code for “make any old bullshit up and pretend it’s true.”

             If all photographs of a round Earth are a hoax, why not simply create photographs of a flat Earth?

            <li>
             A property of mass is that it has gravitational force regardless of size. If the Earth did not have a gravitational field, wouldn’t that imply that the Earth doesn’t physically exist?

            <li>
             Where is the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station located if the south “pole” is the whole circumference of the Earth?
            </li>
            <li>
             Wouldn’t creating such elaborate fakes and conspiracies cost an equal–if not greater–amount of money than the science they are supposedly covering up?
            </li>
            <li>
             The idea of the Earth as a sphere has existed at least since the time of the ancient Greeks, long before NASA. What were their financial motives?
            </li>
            <li>
             What financial motives could NASA have, since their budget is still cut every year?
            </li>
            <li>
             How could the sun be a spotlight if it is a sphere? On the flat Earth, the light projection would have to be a semicircle.

             Why is the Coriolis effect stronger near both poles, instead of stronger in the north and weaker in the south?

            <li>
             If the circumferential south pole is preventing the oceans from pouring over the edge of the flat Earth, why didn’t the oceans disappear during the incredible amount of time it would have taken for that ice to form?
            </li>
            <li>
             If the oceans would–if they could–pour off the edge of the flat Earth, where, then, would they go? Does this mean that whatever keeps the oceans on the surface of the flat Earth only operates in a downward direction on the uppermost surface and is absent on the underneath?

             Surely anyone can see the attempt to simulate authority by wasting space with a wall of text which will obscure any other discussion, as well as the classic “Gish Gallop” of lighting too many small fires that can be put out at one time.

            <p>
             Either take the challenge or do not. In the last bullet point, you assert that celestial bodies are “spheres” when you can’t even observe this. Even if they were spheres it doesn’t mean you live on a sphere. If I see an ice cream truck out my window it doesn’t mean I live on an ice cream truck. But you can’t prove any celestial object to be a sphere through your own observation.... so hopefully people can see that’s the caliber of “argument” you’re bringing to the table.

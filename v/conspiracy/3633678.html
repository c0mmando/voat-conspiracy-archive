             A large portion of China's population is becoming elderly, no longer able to work, not contributing to the country economically, and is becoming a huge drain on their healthcare system, and country. Also, the Chinese are a race of people who are incapable of feeling empathy.
            </p>
            <p>
             So how does Communist China operate? What will they do now that they're faced with these problems?

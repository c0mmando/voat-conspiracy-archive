            This website isn't just
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>

            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            was the first wave of people coming to this site, because they were the most distrustful of reddit and the people most frustrated with it. That doesn't mean that this website should only cater to us just because we came here first. The right to freedom of speech is what this site is build for, and not specifically to support skeptical thinking. Everyone should have the freedom to speak their mind, regardless of whether or not they are interested in conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Independent thinking doesn't mean they have to be interested in conspiracies.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            has a lot of independent thinkers, but that doesn't mean all independent thinkers are conspiracy theorists. We have to relate the website to all, and not to any specific niche.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am all for remove the bad name of conspiracy theories, but that sure doesn't happen by shoving the ideas to them. Let them choose if they want to read up on it. Besides, our numbers are growing every day on its own, without our help.

             I am not saying it is only for this culture or that Whoaverse should cater to it. Your comment expresses some misinterpretation. The goal of this post was to introduce an option in the nav bar to discuss the truth movements, not just free speech (as that is a given). I tend to think ahead of the times so it may not be everyone's thinking but given that we have options for aww &amp; cats, having an option for topics as such is just as vital as the options offered. Especially considering that it actually involves most of the people that visit the site. There is more reasoning to include it then to exclude it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your statement to "have to relate the website to all, and not to any specific niche" is only supporting the idea of introducing an outlet in the main menu. Even if some of your statements contradict themselves, the core concepts discussed in
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             is ultimately to openly discuss &amp; inform people. The next step for the culture to continue is those who do not know better seeing it in same light we do everyday subjects. Movements are occurring all around the world &amp; the culture is not only growing, but is inevitable.

             Truth is truth - one can resist it all they want but it doesn't change the fact that it is purely 'what is'.

            channels here are not what Reddit made them, not at all, the general discussion is not guided by any one point of view, which is all we really need to get good truthful information about or country out into the open.

             That is true only if you fear the thoughts of individuals, the same individuals who are unable to think for themselves and draw thier own conclusion, but I think the culture itself is worth embracing with the current standard.As I have stated in a previous comment, the Conspiracy culture should have some outlet in the main nav. It would ultimately be more effective if there was a rebranded name other than conspiracy - but it would have to be a good &amp; fair representation that will promote a community for individual &amp; independent sovereignty from the current world systems/structures/powers/media/etc

              How about synarchy?
             </p>
             <p>
              I only just created the sub but had been planning to do so for a while, thinking that:
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                The concept of synarchy (rule by a secretive elite) may better encompass the breadth and scope of content which would otherwise find its home in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
                 /v/conspiracy
                </a>
                , and puts a fresh face on this kind of content which could appeal to a broader audience
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
                 /v/conspiracy
                </a>
                could become a "journal" subverse where the moderators are editors and the sub has a review process to ensure all content is of high quality.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                this would enable us to go the next step in our work and investigation re: conspiracies. conspiracy is a legal concept and if we effectively turned
                <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                 /r/conspiracy
                </a>
                into a peer-reviewed law journal (albeit an unconventional one) where the ground-work for building cases to prosecute criminal conspiracies is being done, the sub could evolve into something really cool while
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/synarchy">
                 /v/synarchy
                </a>
                would continue to function as
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
                 /v/conspiracy
                </a>
                used to, albeit with a slightly different perspective.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                This perspective shift, potentially combined with a practical emphasis on conspiracy as a legal concept, could go a long way towards not only changing how others perceive "conspiracy theorists," but could also help us think and work in ways that would be conducive towards actualizing the change we want.

            I'm new to whoaverse but I have seen the influence this sub has. I also don't subscribe to this sub, just cause I haven't done much yet, but shouldn't this sub center on conspiracies, rather than just any free expression of thoughts? I'm all for everyone being able to voice their opinion on stuff, but we don't want this site to just become a chaotic mess where random stuff is in subs that doesn't relate to what's being said. If I'm misunderstanding you then, please, correct me, but that's just how I see it. There's a place for everyhting and everything should be in it's place.

             Put it this way,
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Conspiracy">
              /v/Conspiracy
             </a>
             started out exactly as it was named, but over the course of it's existence, there has been so many different directions and topics it could then be sub-divided so wide that it could have it's own Reddit-like platform. Unfortunately, there has not been one yet and the Reddit community was one of the bigger groupings until it fell victim to heavy moderation, disinformation, shadow banning, etc etc - the list honestly goes on. Since it's conception,
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Conspiracy">
              /v/Conspiracy
             </a>
             has transitioned out of focusing on just conspiracies and expanding more towards just uncovering truth and seeing the bigger pictures in many things. Its almost a juxtaposition how many systems can be deconstructed to find the motive. Regardless of the content itself, the verse has become the 'main' off all the sections it can branch into much like you would see 'news' for all things going on currently or 'technology' being able to cover anything from apple, to NSA Leaks, to drones, to start ups. Your worry towards the site becoming chaotic with random stuff is largely misinterpreted towards the essential reason the verse, and many others, exist. Some people may find that there should be some order to things, and that is more of a perspective than being realistic towards how it operates.
            </p>
            <p>
             To put things in TLDR, basically the name is just a label as the community that evolved out of it is what the primary focus is.
            </p>
            <p>
             In all honesty, it would make more sense for it to rebrand it with a different name that would do better justice to what the sub/verse is about, but without it labeled as such, it would not hold as much merit from the entire community built around
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Conspiracy">
              /v/Conspiracy
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             It should also be noted that the word Conspiracy has been altered due to campaigns attacking people as Conspiracy Theorists (Which are theories, unlike a conspiracy that actually exists). In other terms, the origin of the word Conspiracy was much different before it was altered through social justifications. It's Middle English, from Anglo-French conspirer, from Latin conspirare to be in harmony, conspire, from com- + spirare to breathe - now today is is defined with the words attached to it like 'secrecy' or 'plotting' or 'against evil deeds' - which is all reflective of the discourse of the social alterations.
            </p>
            <p>
             The idea that I am trying to promote is not to shove all the posts into the main grouping (as some posts are really either extreme or perpetuate ideas/labels that require a lot of personal research to understand, think 'esoteric') but rather to include it into the menu. Now it is possible for this verse to not become corrupt as the reddit sub has or be expressed through negative posts/labels. It has a chance to start fresh which will help out a lot.
            </p>

             The core concept towards allowing it to be embrace in the nav menu will allow Whoaverse to promote the community &amp; the idea of a free open platform that actually address some of the major issues that exist in the world &amp; systems in place today. It is helpful for people to publicly see through the manipulated mainstream media thats owned by corperations, to dissecting US social &amp; information attacks to blame Russia without evidence, to even the use of how companies use chemicals like fluoride ( a neuro-toxin) in products like tooth paste. We have sort of been subjected to a world where a lot of the issues discussed are just as important, and the more people aware, the more good that can be done to inform people regarding the truth in all things. Think in terms to how the NSA leaks were a vital subject to inform people on, now for those who have only scratched the surface, there are a ton more topics that affect everyday people in a multitude of ways. The thing is, they allow it all to occur because they don't know better and are not exposed to the bigger picture of things.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most important issue is that humanity, on an individual scale, has to gain it's self-independence back. There are protests going on all over the world, with people out there trying to make a difference &amp; stand up. But if the only promoted material is that of distractions &amp; what is allowed to go through the large censorship in mainstream media, then those voices will go unheard to a vast majority. More and more people are becoming aware of all the mishaps going on, and most of it goes deeper than they could imagine. The whole world is a complex chaotic system - so trying to make sense of it all is important. It is only a matter of time before the majority sees the world for how it truly is, allowing the verse to be an option I think is a small step to allowing that river to flow.

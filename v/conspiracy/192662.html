            Guy stole alcohol to get cops called on him. Gun he pulled was a replica pellet gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Watch the video. He flags the female officer once when she pushes him, but makes no real attempt to aim or fire. This is suicide by cop. Sucks for the cops that they got put in this situation...
           </p>
           <p>
            This is obviously on reddit as well, and some of the comments there really set me off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone there says "Be responsible with your death."
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously?! The guy put the officers in a shitty place, sure, but not a single person asked why he did this. What caused him to do this? Why did he feel his life was helpless? Why would he have himself killed?
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope. He's just an stupid asshole. The world is better off now that he's dead.

            Some serious questions about this footage...
           </p>
           <p>
            1 Where is the alleged stolen alcohol
           </p>
           <p>
            2 Why did they not handcuff him in the toilet
           </p>
           <p>
            3 Why did he move the cutlery away, surely if they felt he was a threat he would have been cuffed immediately
           </p>
           <p>
            4 All over social media people are praising these guys. IMO their negligence to follow standard procedure got a guy killed
           </p>
           <p>
            5 no blood pool?

             I watched this yesterday on reddit about five times before I headed to the comments. Everyone was saying is suicide by cops, but I agree with your post here. I kept asking myself why nothing adds up, why this looks, I don't know, maybe fake? I'm not saying that everyone is wrong in that this is a suicide by cops but are they also saying he called the cops on himself just to die? Are they saying he wanted to die if he got caught stealing alcohol? I don't know, this video just seems different then most videos we see of cop and civilian.

              It's strange, the female cop is looking into the restaurant for a good couple of seconds... then she goes into the toilet. There is no alcohol to be seen (evidence) and they could have read him his miranda rights, cuffed him and he would still be 'alive' today. You can tell by her tone of voice that he definitely arrested (but not cuffed?) and the fact he moves the cutlery away that they deem him to be a threat. To me it looks staged. Too theatrical - Then you go to the comments and all of the reasonable questions are downvoted... Why not cuff him? Surely if this were not staged they fucked up royally, but everyone is 'hey good job police' (RonaldRayGuns), all reasonable questions or criticism are shot down.

               Really glad I'm not the only one thinking this could be staged or something else to that nature. I agree, why wasn't he read his rights, why wasn't he arrested in the first place and why wasn't he hand cuffed. Why does the cop even need to tell the suspect he is being recorded, when have you ever heard a cop tell you "you're being recorded"? It's always the other way around. Once again, I'm always up for interpretations and peoples opinion and I'm not saying what I'm saying is right, but I just feel like we have to ask these questions.

            What most people don't realize is that, when presented with this claim, they immediately think, there is no way that is possible. The logistics involved are not manageable. In today's age, there are cellphones so they could easily have secretly recorded what they're doing. Or there is bound to be a witness that videod this.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, what they don't think through is that, especially in the military and intelligence agencies, just about everyone is lied to so that these types of missions are carried out smoothly without question. Even Colonel's and general's don't have the full picture. They are likely doing the budding of a shadow gov figure. Also, if anyone uses their brain and thinks through the lies they were told or the brainwashing they went through, for instance a corporal, they could be court marshaled, threatened, paid off, framed, or suicided - depending on their approach, context etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then once people realize that many powerful positions in countries and intel-agencies around the world are filled by satanists, the above acts become much easier to believe.

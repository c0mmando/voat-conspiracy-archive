            The so called "hippie" movement was created by the media to hide the fact that so many young people were homeless because their world war two parents were broken, abusive alcoholics who had simply beaten the kids out of the house. George Harrison fled from Haight Ashbury after a brief visit, insisting the hippies were all "bums". It looks better to recast mass homelessness as a "movement"

            San Francisco type hippies were different from Jewish 1960's radicalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Northern California hippies were just basically white people searching for a better life that made sense. The best aspects were a back to the land mentality. A reveling in nature and rejection of Jewish materialism. The drugs wrecked everything like drugs eventually do.

            First the beatnik movement, largely communist in inspiration. This was early 1960s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the Hippie movement, anti-war, in the late 1960s.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the feminist movement, anti-male, in the 1970s.
           </p>
           <p>
            All three movements were fueled by pornography and illegal drugs.

            The term "Hippie" was derived by the establishment and applied almost universally to all young people. It was also seen as a term of derision broadly across the youth scene at the time. Those we call "Hippies" were a diverse lot from diverse backgrounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theory has a lot of truth to it though, I read a nice series of articles that came out in installments on SOTT, something to do with Laurel Canyon &amp; the CIA,
            <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/155794-Inside-The-LC-The-Strange-but-Mostly-True-Story-of-Laurel-Canyon-and-the-Birth-of-the-Hippie-Generation-Part-1">
             found it
            </a>
            .... I think the articles were long since memory-holed though. It went into how Jim Morrison's dad was an Admiral and was in the Gulf of Tonkin and either personally reported the false flag the started the Vietnam War or was deep in that situation either way. It's also went into how a lot of the "Hippie Scene" musicians and artists came from military, military intelligence, or CIA linked families... So there is very much a certain amount of truth and reality to the theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again though all these "Hippies" were not the same, a ton of them came from Christian backgrounds, some of them never even got much into the "drug-scene"... Some of them saw the value in some drugs in moderation, such as cannabis which has since been proven medicinal, and even psychedelic mushrooms which have since been demonstrated if not proven to be medicinal. They were fighting for those rights as well, while trying to take on; the Vietnam War, corrupt establishment, and everything else. A large portion of them would be considered "racist", "sexist", "homophobic", and all sorts of derogatory terms when compared to their modern "counter-parts".
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether they were all actually "Hippies" or not, assuming their is some consensus on a term that was rejected by a large segment who was labeled with it, don't matter, they weren't all the same. They weren't all degenerates, even if they smoked a little pot and tripped shrooms, a large chunk of them were about some sort of family values and rejected the whole Free Sex craze which they accurately pegged as mass whoredom and degeneration...
           </p>
           <p>
            You are correct, it's just a much more complex and nuanced picture when taking in the full scope of the "Hippie" generation.

             I remember coming across this a while back on SOTT and even though it made sense and the dots connected very well, I couldn't understand why in the hell Musicians or people like McKenna would be strategically used and put in place to meet some kind of negative end goal. I couldn't see what that goal was back then. Some of my favorite writers and musicians being used for nefarious purposes. Now I see it though and what it can do to younger minds. They dropped a time bomb into the very things that hold a society together. Hallucinogens can help open your mind to the bullshit around you in everyday life but they can also take a young persons mind and throw it into complete chaos before they've even had a chance to develop. What good is eating mushrooms and exploring the inner depths of the mind if the society around you is falling apart. Some of the things I used to despise when I was younger I've come to appreciate because they're the glue that hold our society together.

            The CIA Created The Drug Culture My Weekend with Timothy Leary, By Henry Makow PhD
           </p>
           <p>
            "In the 1950's, the CIA experimented with LSD for use in interrogation and as a weapon.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the 1960's they used this weapon to divert idealistic Americans from the path of social action to one of introspection and self-gratification, i.e. "spiritual liberation."
           </p>
           <p>
            They neutralized my generation by turning angry protesters into "flower children" preaching "peace and love."
           </p>
           <p>
            The mantra of the age was "Tune in, Turn on and Drop Out". The prophet was psychologist, Dr. Timothy Leary (1920-1996).
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Leary working for the CIA?"

            Well, the Frankfurt School was responsible for it, and they'd been around since the late '20s and early '30s.

            Kabbalists believe that God was shattered by the act of Creation, and that His attributes lay as “holy sparks” imbedded in Creation that must be picked up in order for Him to be restored to oneness (known as the act of tikkun). The kabbalist therefore believes that the Jewish Messiah will never arrive–and thus Mankind will never be liberated–until God is restored to oneness. The way to do this, according to kabbalists, is engage in acts of holiness and meditation in order to retrieve the sparks of God.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the year 1666, a kabbalist and occultist named Sabbatai Zevi declared himself the Jewish Messiah. Upon his messiahship, he turned the Torah around by declaring that all sins were now considered holy and that to only way to “repair” God was to engage in acts of depravity. He lost several followers after the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire forced him to convert to Islam, but several Jews still followed him. 100 years later, Jacob Frank declared himself to be the reincarnation of Sabbatai Zevi and took those ideas to an even greater extreme.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to him, in order for God to be repaired and for the Messianic Era to arrive, mankind must destroy all of its traditional moral values and go beyond good and evil. The Frankists, as they were called, engaged in every horrible thing you could imagine–black magic, wife-swapping, sex orgies, homosexuality, incest, pedophilia, and they promoted a form of proto-feminism and proto-communism. Every one of these acts was considered to be a “holy tikkun” (restoration) of God if done with holy intent. They were entirely apocalyptic and despised the world of Creation, seeking to bring about its early end and to bring forth a Messianic utopia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sabbatean and Frankist heresies seemed to disappear by the start of the 19th century. However, there was still an active Frankist stronghold in Frankfurt, Germany during that time. These Frankists were known to be affiliated with the Freemason lodges around the city. One such Freemason was a man by the name of Franz Joseph Molitor. He was a known satanist and alchemist who took a strong interest in the Kabbalah, even going so tar as to synthesize the Kabbalah with a perverted form of ‘Christianity’. This is what lead him to picking up Sabbatean-Frankist ideology. In order to promote his views, he authored a four-volume set of books promoting a bastardized understanding of ‘Judaism’ written from a kabbalist and Sabbatean perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            These books of Molitor’s were picked up in the early 20th century by two young Jewish scholars from Berlin: Gershom Scholem and his best friend Walter Benjamin. Benjamin later became a Marxist after living in the USSR and meeting with Georg Lukacs, joined the Frankfurt School, and became one of the main intellectuals behind Critical Theory alongside Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adomo.

             What do you recommend for someone to learn more. I have seen interviews with Marvin Antelma and Barry Chamish on this. Robert Sepher and David Livingstone talk about the Sabbatean Frankists too. But I am looking for more sources.

              It the most important part. It's the secret movement behind every movement of the 20th century. The Sabbatean Frankists were crypto converts to Christianity and Islam and other sects in order to subvert and control them from within. The Frankfurt school (crypto SF followers) was an academic think tank which infiltrated school boards and universities.

            you obviously want to see these guys in prison, and i have no problem with that whatsoever, but i think we need to consider what our goals should be as humans on this Earth - is it revenge, or is it to move forward and grow?
           </p>
           <p>
            we can argue that sorting out the mess of 9/11 will uncover corruption and criminal activity which, in turn, may allow us to repair the system and move forward, but we must also realize that we would be working within the bounds of a thoroughly corrupt legal system from bottom to top
           </p>
           <p>
            when you sell drugs to people on the street, you're a drug dealer, but when you wear a white lab coat, you're a pharmacist - the entire system is tailored to protect the criminals running it and therefor one will rarely get anywhere working within it - we still haven't put a damn person in jail for killing J. Kennedy except for a "lone nut" patsy who very likely never pulled a trigger that day - what makes anyone think there will ever be an honest investigation into 9/11 when there is a great deal more at stake? much less an honest court that will put these people away
           </p>
           <p>
            does that mean the situation is hopeless? not at all! but i think it does mean that the better solution is probably to work
            <em>
             outside
            </em>
            of it and not waste our time calling for an "independent" investigation of 9/11 that a), has a very, VERY low probability of ever happening and b), tells us what? what we already know? anyone who investigates this will immediately realize who was involved and what the goals were - it's all in the public domain - so what good does it do to put a handful of people in prison? isn't there more ready to take their places? how does this change the system? how does does it deter the same behavior in the future in a system that revolves entirely around greed?
           </p>
           <p>
            i think the better solution is to do
            <em>
             less
            </em>
            , not more - disconnect from the system as much as possible and just leave it alone - the system requires our support to function and without it, it will collapse because of it's own weight - stop feeding it, stop watching the boob-tube, spend time with family, get out of debt and get rid of credit cards and bank accounts, stop buying useless plastic widgets, grow a garden, home school our kids instead of handing off our responsibility to the government who causes all the problems, etc., etc.

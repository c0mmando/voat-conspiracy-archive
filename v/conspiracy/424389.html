            The Chinese fire fighters were on scene.

            Either they didn't know it was sodium cyanide or they didn't know not to spray it with water.

             Sodium Cyanide reacts with water.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FIRE FIGHTING INFORMATION:
Sodium cyanide is non-combustible.
The agent itself does not burn.
Sodium cyanide releases highly flammable and toxic hydrogen cyanide gas on contact with acids or water.
Fire will produce irritating, corrosive, and/or toxic gases.
Note: Most foams will react with the agent and release corrosive/toxic gases.
For small fires, do not use carbon dioxide; use dry chemical, dry sand, or alcohol-resistant foam.
For large fires, use water spray, fog, or alcohol-resistant foam. Move containers from the fire area if it is possible to do so without risk to personnel. Use water spray or fog; do not use straight streams. Dike fire control water for later disposal; do not scatter the material.
For fire involving tanks or car/trailer loads, fight the fire from maximum distance or use unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles. Do not get water inside containers. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after the fire is out. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tanks. Always stay away from tanks engulfed in fire.
Run-off from fire control or dilution water may be corrosive and/or toxic, and it may cause pollution.
If the situation allows, control and properly dispose of run-off (effluent).

            This is interesting, but lacking substance. It wouldn't surprise me for a second if the explosion was caused by someone who doesn't like china, but I just don't think a rod weapon just would make a fireball like that from the video. Even if it was a rod, there was already some sort of explosive on the ground, making an air-based attack tactically stupid.

            The "Rod of God" conspiracy theory Mark Dice proposes is pretty cool, but it doesn't align with the videos which look chemical to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the U.S. were making free fishing ponds in China with kinetic weapons, the blast would be one big, bright flash/boom, without so much rolling flames and smoke.

            If there continues to be an uptick in bombings/explosions like this (also referencing Bangkok bomb) then it's time to start looking at Israel again.
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks certain (to me at least) that Schumer is going to be successful at vetoing the Iran nuke treaty, which leaves us with a big "what now?" that's going to, what, last a year-and-a-half until the next U.S. Prez gets elected?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anybody else believe for a moment that Israel will just sit there and bide its time as Iran now almost certainly begins in earnest to build the damn bomb given their resort to peace was spurned?
           </p>
           <p>
            So how to dull the inevitable uproar over unilateral action by Israel against Iran?  Work to make certain there are background atrocities diverting everyone's attention?

            Maybe they nuked themselves so they could blame us. They fight dirty. If this was sabotage, there is no reason to pick Space Weapons over a suitcase nuke or just plain old C4 on the right container of material.

            I don't entirely trust Natural News, they've done quite a bit of unfounded fear-mongering in the past...
           </p>

            But at the same time, knowing the shit that America has done in the past, and knowing how badly the US economy can fall if this is true... Well, let's just say that I'm not ruling it out entirely just yet.

             This is natural"news".com, their proof is that "black helicopters" were flying around Beijing, which everyone knows is evidence of the deployment of a super space weapon that thousands of independent researchers who are monitoring different aspects of the atmosphere every day were unable to recognize.

             Edit: let's see... super space weapon OR an industrial accident in China?
            </p>
            <p>
             There are serious industrial accidents every single day in China, mostly because of lax regulatory enforcement, cutting corners, etc. Either way, China is a HUGE country and it would be impossible to completely monitor safety standards in any case.
            </p>
            <p>
             What probably made this one into a major industrial accident was that the firefighters who responded to the initial fire were comprised of young, almost untrained recruits, and they were not told clearly that some of the stored volatile materials in the warehouse could become violently combustible on mixing with water.
            </p>
            <p>
             Industrial accidents are pretty common in China (and actually pretty much everywhere), this one is just different because of the size of the explosion

              I think that we will all see the truth of this in the following months regardless of what any of us have to think about it.  Would you admit that this explosion taking place a day after the devaluation of their currency is pretty suspicious?

               No, I don't think it is suspicious... to start with, I don't think that there is clear meaning to the idea that a devaluation harms "the US". There are many different constituents in the US economy (eg consumers, businesses, and the government) and broadly speaking they will each be affected differently by changes in a trading partner's fixed peg currency system.
              </p>
              <p>
               From a very high level, a devaluation might make Chinese imports to the US cheaper - that is clearly a great thing for US consumers, that means that we can buy more for less. It also keeps consumer price inflation down. But, does it hurt US trade and US businesses?
              </p>
              <p>
               Not really, as we don't compete with China very much in the same products. They make low-value, low-margin products (textiles, disposable consumer goods, etc.) and sometimes they make higher technology products, but almost exclusively as manufacturers for US companies, who make the high margins (as Apple does with its products that are made in China, but the intellectual property, brand, etc. are all earned by Americans, not the Chinese). US companies tend to make products that are high-value or technology intensive or are mission critical and require standards that Chinese companies generally cannot match. Some US companies that export to China (like Coach) will be affected and US car companies will definitely see some reduction in sales, however, the sales of most US car companies in China are comprised of cars that are actually manufactured in China (there is a luxury car import tax that is on the order of 30% or more).
              </p>
              <p>
               Even if China were to revalue its currency upwards by 5% (making Chinese goods more expensive), it won't bring back labor-intensive manufacturing jobs to the US, as the wage differentials in the US are more on the order of 100% greater. If anything, China devaluing its currency will take business from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and other similarly low-wage export countries.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for the US government being angry over China devaluing their currency, it doesn't quite add up either - a devaluation actually means that the Chinese Central Bank (the People's Bank of China) will need to actually accumulate more US Treasuries as a mechanism for adjustment, hardly a reason for the US to attack someone. In fact, there is speculation that the Fed is relieved that the PBC devalued as that means that there is more of an excuse not to raise rates before the US economy is ready. The IMF openly praised China's revaluation as a move towards a more market oriented currency system (
               <a href="http://www.skynews.com.au/business/business/world/2015/08/12/imf-welcomes-china-s-yuan-valuation-move.html">
                http://www.skynews.com.au/business/business/world/2015/08/12/imf-welcomes-china-s-yuan-valuation-move.html
               </a>
               )
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, to put things in perspective - the Yen is down 35% since 2012 and the Euro is down almost as much over the same time period. These are trading partners that we compete with directly.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know that there is a lot hardpolitik and very, very dirty play underneath the surface level of global politics, but I don't see how the RMB revaluation could be the impetus for a US strike on a sovereign nuclear power. Overall, I don't know whether or not we have that kind of strike capability, but it seems like this would be a poor reason to use it.

                 In thinking about what the real story behind global politics actually is, I like to think that it's more important to look at the winners and losers of different actions. An RMB devaluation by 5% doesn't really hurt the US all that much, and it's been far surpassed by other countries like Japan and the Euro system (currencies both down over 30% over past few years). If anything, we should beg them to sell us more goods cheaply and keeping our borrowing costs down by buying our government debt.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you wanted to look at something where I think that examining the incentives was applicable, I would think that it's strange that a terrorist attack committed by 15 Saudi nationals (of the 19 total) caused us to turn around and attack two unrelated countries and spend trillions that have gone towards government contractors, defense companies, basically everyone that Eisenhower warned us about in his farewell speech. 15 of 19 were Saudis, yet we never even questioned any of the Saudi leaders who were in the US at the time, we actually got them out of the US as fast as possible during the no-fly period.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's a shame... that money will never come back to the US, never build a single school, hospital, research lab in America and basically is just gone forever.

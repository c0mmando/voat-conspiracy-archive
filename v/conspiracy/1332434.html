            Cool, very glad you liked the video. I really tried to connect as many dots/ideas as I could while trying to make sure that the main message was not lost.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a follow up to the model of Differential Accumulation I would suggest visiting the
            <a href="http://www.capitalaspower.com/">
             Capital as Power
            </a>
            website. They also have
            <a href="http://www.capitalaspower.com/forum/">
             Forums
            </a>
            that might be helpful
            <em>
             (I actually only found out about this site after contacting Prof Nitzan).
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            As for a follow-up video from me, I do have one lined up to do soon-ish, in the next could of weeks. After putting up this video I sent a link to Prof Nitzan thanking him for his work. To my surprise he watched the whole video and contacted me, which is very cool. Guess he liked it as well :)
           </p>
           <p>
            He made a couple of comments/corrections regarding my wording, which I agree with fulling. So my follow-up video is going to be about exploring these ideas a little further. It will be a much shorter video, a sort of update. Here is what I will be covering -
            <a href="http://www.capitalaspower.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=463">
             link to the comment I made on the capital as Power forum
            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Prof. Nitzan was kind enough to correct me on two of my errors in this video: First, I should not just be talking about rate of interest, but rate of return. Second, quoting Prof. Nitzan,
             <em>
              "differential growth rates do not necessarily imply the concentration of all capitalized power in the hands of a single entity. The reason is that power is a dialectical process: it elicits its own resistance, and that resistance creorders the very underpinnings of power (see for example our 2012 paper on the "Asymptotes of Power" --
              <a href="http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/336/">

           <p>
            Aside from that, I plan on putting together many many more videos about the mathematics of economics in the future. It's a topic that I love and wish to share, not to mention that it's fun to do.

            I like the relaxed atmosphere that these videos are done in.. I thought I was only going to watch a few minutes of it but ended up watching the whole thing.. I'm going to try watching some of the other ones in the ASMR Math playlist later tonight..

             Cool, glad you liked. I started making these videos exactly for that reason. Kept on getting comments that people would get anxiety trying to learn math, so I chilled it down and overlapped it with ASMR. Fun to do :)

            Good for you! I was in lending for a long time, and trying to explain to people that the interest rates they pay on what they buy is often the difference between long term financial survival and disaster down the road. Even after calculating things out for them, they would often look at me as if I was some space alien, but I kept doING it...

Like Ken Kesey, a Merry Prankster riding his own bus Furthur down into a black hole of total alienation from society, one Top Secret leak at a time.  He\'s now hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after having been given political asylum by a third-world third-rate semi-dictatorship. On the run supposedly from a stalled Swiss rape investigation of dubious origin, but with a presumed U.S. and British noose dangling in wait. </p>
<p>Yeah, <em>that guy.</em> </p>
<p>But did you know as a child he was raised in an LSD cult that happened to have its own psychiatric facility notorious for being connected to the Australian intelligence community? A cult known to kidnap children and raise them in strict uniformity, all with the same short haircut and dyed-blond hair. An up-and-coming \'after the cataclysm\' Aryan  it\'s spelled \'ubermensch\' in the making.... </p>
<p>We\'ll begin with the notorious hacker-spy\'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange">Wikipedia page</a>, which has this to say about his childhood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...around 1979 Assange\'s mother then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of the Australian New Age group <strong>The Family</strong>, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was this cult, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_%28Australian_New_Age_group%29">The Family</a>? Well, it was founded by Anne Hamilton-Byrne, a Yoga instructor who mixed quasi-religious Far Eastern and Christian theology with White Supremacy. </p>
<p>Members were educated. It was so well-funded the group bought an entire psychiatric hospital, where cult members who just so happened to also be psychiatrists ran the institution. Giving them access to both psychiatric and psychedelic drugs, electro-shock therapy equipment, and even lobotomy facilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the late 1960s and the 1970s, Newhaven Hospital in Kew was a private psychiatric hospital owned and managed by Marion Villimek, a Santiniketan member; many of its staff and attending psychiatrists were also members.[4][8][9]</p>
<p>Many patients at Newhaven were treated with the hallucinogenic drug LSD.[10] The hospital was used to recruit potential new members from among the patients, and also to administer LSD to members under the direction of the Santiniketan psychiatrists Dr John Mackay and Dr Howard Whitaker.[11] One of the original members of the Association was given LSD, electroconvulsive therapy and two leucotomies, also called lobotomies, during the late 1960s.[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, curiously, it\'s also a place where white children were kidnapped and deposited into Ms. Hamilton-Byrne\'s care. The children were adopted and their last names changed to Hamilton-Byrne. They called her mother. They all had their hair uniformly dyed blond like proper members of the Aryan Master Race. Member parents of youth gave up parental rights and were treated as Aunts and Uncles of their own children. Rather reminiscent of Hitler Youth. </p>
<p>Julian became trapped in this situation by no fault of his own. His mother had simply fallen in love with a nut. Who brought him into this cult. And he was unfortunately indoctrinated. Here\'s a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/uUkxB.jpg">photo of him</a> as a child member. Note the blond hair, uniform with all the other kids. And how he seemingly dyes his hair even today. </p>
<p>The story seems to have first gained notice in 2010. Here\'s <a href="http://spitfirelist.com/for-the-record/ftr-724-wiki-of-the-damned/">a combined text and podcast</a> entry by David Emory from the time. All of it is worth reading and listening to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Assange (pic­tured at left) claims to have been “on the run” from the cult, his claims of links to Aus­tralian intel­li­gence plus his strange, “plat­inum” col­ored hair (dis­tinc­tive of chil­dren raised in the group) sug­gest that the con­nec­tions may run much deeper. (Recall in this con­text that the group prac­tices rig­or­ous, sophis­ti­cated mind-control method­ol­ogy and Assange him­self may be sin­cerely unaware of the depth of his appar­ent links to the group. The orga­ni­za­tion also devel­ops mul­ti­ple iden­ti­ties for the chil­dren raised in its ranks, as well as obtain­ing mul­ti­ple pass­ports for them. ...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of inter­est and pos­si­ble sig­nif­i­cance, also, is the alle­ga­tion by Moore that Sandoz–part of the old I.G. Far­ben complex–was pro­vid­ing the group with free LSD. San­doz also bought the fam­ily busi­ness of Swiss Nazi financier Carl Lund­strom, thereby empow­er­ing him with the cap­i­tal with which he has real­ized his polit­i­cal endeavors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also in 2010 was this <a href="http://arthurzbygniew.blogspot.com.au/2010/03/soros-co-back-wikileaks-kosher-mob-oval.html">Arthur Zbygniew blog post</a> that referenced Cryptome founder John Young, who left Wikileaks in 2007 claiming it was a disinformation front. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our Asian intelligence sources report the following: &quot;Wikileaks is running a disinformation campaign, crying persecution by U.S. intelligence- when it is U.S. intelligence itself. Its [Wikileaks\'] activities in Iceland are totally suspect.&quot; Wikileaks claims it is the victim of a new COINTELPRO [Counter Intelligence Program] operation directed by the Pentagon and various U.S. intelligence agencies. WMR\'s sources believe that it is Wikileaks that is part and parcel of a cyber-COINTELPRO campaign, such as that proposed by President Obama\'s &quot;information czar,&quot; Dr. Cass Sunstein.</p>
<p>In January 2007, John Young, who runs cryptome.org, a site that publishes a wealth of sensitive and classified information, left Wikileaks, claiming the operation was a CIA front. Young also published some 150 email messages sent by Wikileaks activists on cryptome. They include a disparaging comment about this editor by Wikileaks co-founder Dr. Julian Assange of Australia. Assange lists as one of his professions &quot;hacker.&quot; His German co-founder of Wikileaks uses a pseudonym, &quot;Daniel Schmitt.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet one of the points of contention at the time was whether the helicopter video leak that would later be known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0">Collateral Muder</a> was real and would - in fact - be released. Yet it was. And it had a dramatic effect, with vast US resources spent to discredit and diminish the media impact of that video. The same could be said of the leak and release of thousands of historical and recent diplomatic cables; so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak">Cablegate</a>. The US government responded by charging and convicting the leaker, Bradley Manning, under the Espionage Act, who now serves a 35 year prison sentence in a military prison.   
</p>
<p>And so Assange is now on the run once again. Only this time it\'s not from crazed cult members. It\'s from British authorities, who camp out in front of the Ecuadorian Embassy to prevent him from fleeing the country. </p>
<p>If Assange really was and is some \'Controlled Opposition\' operative, he\'s doing a bad job of it. The dude\'s really pissed off the U.S. and NATO intelligence community. Perhaps there\'s another explanation. </p>
<p>He\'s said he opposed the events of his and his mother\'s capture and subsequent flight from The Family cult. And he\'s said he opposes institutional abuse by government and corporate hands. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/news/2010/07/26/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-war-logs-i-enjoy-crushing-bastards">Der Spiegel interview</a> he responded to the question of why he does what he does. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SPIEGEL: You could have started a company in Silicon Valley and lived in a home in Palo Alto with a swimming pool. Why did you decide to do the WikiLeaks project instead?</p>
<p>Assange: We all only live once. So we are obligated to make good use of the time that we have, and to do something that is meaningful and satisfying. This is something that I find meaningful and satisfying. That is my temperament. I enjoy creating systems on a grand scale, and I enjoy helping people who are vulnerable. And <strong>I enjoy crushing bastards.</strong> So it is enjoyable work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here\'s my perspective on this. </p>
<p>Ii seems Assange did go through some kind of mind-control abuse in childhood. It\'s clear the experience had lingering effect, such as dying his hair blond. A sort of echo of that which he inculcated in his pre-teen youth. </p>
<p>At that time Anne Hamilton-Byrne and the cult around her would have been viewed as institutional authority for the child. Much like parents. And the then the state, supplanting parents as a higher authority for most adults.  
</p>
<p>But in his teenage years he broke free of it, largely because his mother took the courageous step of fleeing from those dangerous nuts. But also because teenagers rebel. And for Assange, this rebellion led to a total breakdown in trust of all institutional authority. Because no institution is free of some corruption. So he seeks to destroy them. Because the people who run these corrupt institutions are bastards who abuse the vulnerable. And he enjoys crushing them. </p>
<p>He does this out of personal vengeance.  
</p>
<p>Which suggests his experience in The Family remains a crucial psychological foundation for why he\'s risked everything to reveal these state secrets. </p>
<p>What they did to him in childhood at that place did have a lasting effect. Just not the one most conspiracy theorists assume would happen from drug and hypnotic induced mind control. The control triggers to force induced behavioral patterns became muted. Leaving underlying anger at what they did to him. Which he transferred outward to society at large. And that led him to focus on larger institutions as prey to satisfy his craving for retribution.   
</p>
<p>He\'s a fucked up dude. But probably not a mind-controlled slave. Which gives hope for all the others abused by these secret programs. Maybe there\'s a way out for them too.</p>',

This is something that I find meaningful and satisfying. That is my temperament. I enjoy creating systems on a grand scale, and I enjoy helping people who are vulnerable. And

            So it is enjoyable work.

           So here's my perspective on this.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ii seems Assange did go through some kind of mind-control abuse in childhood. It's clear the experience had lingering effect, such as dying his hair blond. A sort of echo of that which he inculcated in his pre-teen youth.
          </p>
          <p>
           At that time Anne Hamilton-Byrne and the cult around her would have been viewed as institutional authority for the child. Much like parents. And the then the state, supplanting parents as a higher authority for most adults.
          </p>
          <p>
           But in his teenage years he broke free of it, largely because his mother took the courageous step of fleeing from those dangerous nuts. But also because teenagers rebel. And for Assange, this rebellion led to a total breakdown in trust of all institutional authority. Because no institution is free of some corruption. So he seeks to destroy them. Because the people who run these corrupt institutions are bastards who abuse the vulnerable. And he enjoys crushing them.
          </p>
          <p>
           He does this out of personal vengeance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Which suggests his experience in The Family remains a crucial psychological foundation for why he's risked everything to reveal these state secrets.
          </p>
          <p>
           What they did to him in childhood at that place did have a lasting effect. Just not the one most conspiracy theorists assume would happen from drug and hypnotic induced mind control. The control triggers to force induced behavioral patterns became muted. Leaving underlying anger at what they did to him. Which he transferred outward to society at large. And that led him to focus on larger institutions as prey to satisfy his craving for retribution.
          </p>
          <p>
           He's a fucked up dude. But probably not a mind-controlled slave. Which gives hope for all the others abused by these secret programs. Maybe there's a way out for them too.

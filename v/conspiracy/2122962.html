<p>The books are full of stiff, 1800s writing style, and even though the Baron Trump novels are classified as children\'s Science Fiction, they make you realize how little science was known in the 1800s compared to our day. They also contain many joke references that only someone familiar with day to day life in the 18090s would &quot;get.&quot; But whassup with Lockwood including references to Russia, Trump Castle, Fifth Avenue and virtual dwellers in &quot;Goggle Land?&quot;</p>',

<blockquote>
<p>Since 1887, 3 U.S.C. 15 sets the method for objections to electoral votes. During the Joint Session, Members of Congress may object to individual electoral votes or to state returns as a whole. An objection must be declared in writing and signed by at least one Representative and one Senator. In the case of an objection, the Joint Session recesses and each chamber considers the objection separately in a session which cannot last more than two hours with each Member speaking for no more than five minutes. After each house votes on whether or not to accept the objection, the Joint Session reconvenes and both chambers disclose their decisions. If they agree to the objection, the votes in question are not counted. If either chamber does not agree with the objection, the votes are counted.

<p>I doubt seriously they\'ll let this opportunity go to waste.<br />
They may do this to simply continue throwing fuel on the fire.<br />
However, if some new extraordinary evidence were to surface, things could get ugly.<br />
I don\'t think the public\'s trust in U.S. Intelligence sources is strong enough at this time<br />
for any evidence provided by them to persuade Congress to stop Trump from becoming President.  
</p>
<p>However, Wikileaks is a different story.<br />
Unfortunately, there\'s still a very good possibility Wikileaks is compromised.<br />
So we may see them release documents showing collusion between Trump and Russia.  
</p>
<p>They may even claim Petr Polshikov leaked them.<br />
I don\'t know much about him, but I find this very suspicious:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A top Russian diplomat was found dead in his Moscow apartment Monday, just hours after Russia’s Ambassador to Turkey was shot dead at an art exhibit in Ankara.</p>
<p>Petr Polshikov, 56, was discovered with a bullet wound to the head, according to reports. The announcement came just hours after Ambassador Andrey Karlov was assassinated in Ankara.</p>
<p>Two empty bullet shells were found in the apartment, and a gun was discovered under the sink in the bathroom, according to the UK’s Evening Standard. His wife was also reportedly home at the time of the killing, but was safe in another room. Police are exploring all possibilities at the time being.</p>
<p>Polshikov was a senior figure in the Latin American department of the Russian foreign ministry. While there are some reports that the career-diplomat had left the Ministry, it was unclear if he was currently working for another branch of the Russian government at the time of his death.</p>

<p>In any case, stay alert and very critical of any bombshells.<br />
They\'re desperate and capable of anything right now.</p>',

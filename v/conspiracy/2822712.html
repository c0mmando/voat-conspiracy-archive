            There are many references to Bernard Baruch in this (link below) - too many to list/explain in this post:
           </p>
           <p>
            "CHAPTER EIGHT World War One [SECRETS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE By Eustace Mullins]"
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/TBOD0#selection-13.0-37.1">
             http://archive.is/TBOD0#selection-13.0-37.1
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The book "Secrets of the Federal Reserve" was written by Eustace Mullins as suggested to him by Ezra Pound (one of the USA's most influential writers; the majority of Americans know little to nothing about Ezra Pound or all of his work, because he was a counter-semite). Mullins could not find a publisher for his book in the USA, so he went to Germany (around 1956) and had 50 thousands books printed. Those books were confiscated by the US military, which had total control of Germany then; the books were burned. In later years, Mullins was able to publish some copies of the book. It is fully documented using sources such as using official congressional records - to prove that the Fed Reserve was and is a privately owned bank)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also search for Bernard Baruch's role in having the atomic bombs developed and using these on Japan (which as not necessary and is a crime against humanity)
           </p>
           <p>
            Baruch family is also cited in "The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews", which uses only jewish written sources to document the relationship.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bernard Baruch was a key supporter of Eisenhower and helping him to become US president
           </p>
           <p>
            Search also for Baruch's role in WWI, WWII, banking, influencing Woodrow Wilson, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some video/interviews on this topic as well - again too many to list here - so you gonna have to do that

            And this re: The Book of Baruch, not part of the regular Bible but part of the Septuagint. It is also I believe used as part of the Jewish faith. Other than that I'll have to do more studying I don't know much about this book.

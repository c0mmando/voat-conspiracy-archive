            what video are you watching? I have the full thing saved in decent quality, and I have to admit, the video has very small amount of blood, of all the shots fired, I don't see a single entry or exit wound.  it looks exactly as OP describes. like a jet of air is shot at each person. what blood I did see, could be explained by a paint gun or something. the lady outside is the only one that had any significant blood, and that's been explained. if dexter came to this crime scene they would send him home early, and yeah the blood pools don't show up till he visits the car... no screams, or even loud moans. untrained victims that are shot don't just drop straight down, they try and get away for a few seconds. its a natural unstoppable reaction.
           </p>

            and,
           </p>

            NOT A SINGLE GRUNT OR OWIE THAT HURTS.

            Think about that dude shoots up 20 people and nobody even says ouch? how rude! I have seen people make more noise when they got a haingnail pulled.

            They don't want you to be able to analyze it for yourself.  You might come to the conclusion it was fake bullshit, and they can't have you thinking for yourself.  I saw it when it first came out.  I did not see any blood even on individuals with white clothing.  This is shooting was a fake.

            NZ banned Dissenter, Voat, 8ch.  They don’t want anyone in NZ finding out how weird this shit is.  Dude fuckin went to Pakistan a year ago but after the little girl he claims to justify his actions died and sang praise to Pakistanis.  Something is

            I have to say the speed they used to remove this from FB Live was "Phenomenal". When a young child commits suicide or accidentally kills themselves, it takes the Parents 1-2 YEARS with LAWYERS to get it done...Thanks for showing your Cards to the world FB they NOW know you've had the ability ALL this time you just CHOSE to be a dick... I secretly am so giddy this gem is exposed maybe more people will get off of it!!!

However,  today, the design has been destroyed and today we have trunks, gates and filters. This is no longer the internet. I'm not sure what we should call it.

             Hey look! An idiot boomer who has no idea what he's talking about. The internet still works fine for those of us who know how to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure if your idea of "the internet" is Facebook, Google, Twitter, YouTube, etc. then yes, it's broken. But just because those services ON the internet are broken, doesn't mean that the internet itself is broken. The network still routes around damage (including censorship) just like it always has.
            </p>
            <p>
             Choosing to use online gated communities with censors and filters is your problem, not ours. Just like choosing to live in shitty sea-nigger countries with no 1st or 2nd Amendment protections is not our problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've seen the video; this tells me the internet is working fine as usual. Don't blame others because you don't know what you're doing.

              Tell Pirate Bay that. Tell Kim.com that. I seem to recall CloudFlare deplatformed some sites like DailyStormer, backpage.com has been seized. Don't get me started with GoDaddy. Germany is going to make TOR illegal. ICANN will seize domains. This is where I'm coming from. Not to mention the bullshit from last mile provides that port block and deep packet inspect in order to "manage" their network. Think that isn't happening in the United States? How about Verizon not providing enough peer transit connections? I don't know where you've been hiding not to realize this.

             News :
MI5 was last night investigating New Zealand gunman Brenton Tarrant over possible links to far-right extremists in Britain.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 28-year-old's travel across countries including Turkey and Bulgaria are today being probed as the aftermath of the Christchurch massacre continues.

             North Korea, Pakistan, Turkey, Eastern Europe, France and elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ankara on Friday said it was investigating Tarrant's multiple visits to Turkey, and who he might have met while he was there. The Bulgarian government has also said it was looking into Tarrant, who apparently visited the country late last year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tarrant's 74-page manifesto said he first began considering an attack in April and May of 2017 while travelling in France and elsewhere in Western Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             London's Independent newspaper said he allegedly met right-wing extremists during a visit to Europe that year and declared allegiance to a group he called Europeans. Tarrant also claimed he contacted an anti-immigration group called the reborn Knights Templar.
            </p>
            <p>
             He planned not only the two-site murder rampage but also the manifesto and a social media campaign, which included his newly created Twitter account, full of links to white supremacist and anti-immigration postings.
            </p>
            <p>
             The manifesto also said he chose to make his attack in New Zealand to show that nowhere in the world was safe.

             Tarrant had worked as a personal trainer, according to the Australian Broadcasting Company. The news organization reported the manager of a gym where Tarrant was employed said he began traveling overseas in 2011. Manager Tracy Gray said Tarrant traveled to Europe and Asia, including North Korea. A photo published online by ABC shows Tarrant in Pakistan in 2018.

             Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, appeared in Christchurch District Court on Saturday morning. He faced one murder charge, but police say more are likely.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tarrant was believed to have met extreme right-wing groups during a visit to Europe two years ago, security sources told UK paper The Independent.
            </p>
            <p>
             He reportedly started to travel about 2011 after the death of his father, heading to Turkey and Pakistan, as well as the Balkans.

             The gym's owner, Tracey Gray, described him as a hard-working trainer but said he appeared to have been changed by his travels in Europe and Asia - which social media posts suggested included trips as far afield as Pakistan and North Korea. Advertisement

            <p>
             "I think something must have changed in him during the years he spent travelling overseas," Gray told national broadcaster ABC.

             How about no blood splatter anywhere (except a couple of small blood pools
             <strong>
              AFTER
             </strong>
             the shooter returns and they had 5 minutes to create with makeup ONE entry hole in the head and 1 or 2 blood pools), no bullet holes in the wall, no entry wounds, all those when he is shooting 2 inches in front of the victim in front of a white wall.
            </p>
            <p>
             The video is a joke PG-13 mass shooting. He is shooting blanks. All you see is pressurized air throwing 2 hats and hair out of place. Real official military exercises with real official crisis actors (a lot of time amputees) are thousand times more gruesome. Because, you know, they prepare the soldiers for the real thing, which is gruesome, not PG-13. You can watch those on youtube. The makeup is so real it is really disgusting. But, in a "real" mass shooting you are searching for the blood with a microscope. Give me a break.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last lady in the pavement had a blood bug in hair hand out of view. Watch frame by frame. The "blood" begins from there while the shooter shoots in the head.
            </p>

             No real victims -&gt; No real investigations -&gt; No chance of exposing any kind of conspiracy to ban weapons, etc.

             People think it's easier to just kill people. No, it's not. You risk 100 things going wrong, like someone actually killing the shooter. They are all about control.

             Crisis actors are not just actors. They are agents and their family members. People need to stop thinking they are random nobodies that are paid 20 bucks.

                    i've watch the video probably close to 500 times now. there's nothing in her hands
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    i just rewatched this section frame by frame (again) and there's nothing in her hands. you can clearly see her empty hand when she moves it too her head right after getting shot in the shoulder
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    are you trying to say that white on he sleeve is a cable? what kind of cables do you use that are as thick as your thumb?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    but even if there is, so what? people tense their muscles when they suddenly find themselves in pain so your argument of "she has an iphone/ipod in her hand and didn't drop it when shot so it must be fake" is also retarded

                     when he shoots her it looks like just air was shot at her, no entry wound visible. same with the entire video for that matter none shows any entry or exit wounds, no holes in walls or evidence he shot the floor, no blood spatter which would be everywhere. quite the mind fuck ill admit.

               You are so easily fooled. Look how easily it's done, of course with minimum not gruesome effect.

                It's fucking hilarious that you actually think he's only shooting pressurized air. What is compressing the air? Where is the air tank? Do you know how loud an air compressor is?

                It's obvious from your 2 year old account and grand total of 28 CCP that you're a sleeper account here to spread disinformation. I've even seen shills like yourself claiming it's fake because there's no shells anywhere, when you can clearly see shells being ejected whenever he fires his rifle. It's also obvious you've never been in a firefight or killed anybody with a rifle yourself, so why pretend to know what you're talking about? Don't you realize what kind of people voat users are?

                 The reason I mentioned that scene is
                 <strong>
                  BECAUSE
                 </strong>
                 it's the only realistic
scene. That was the point. To show how the only one realistic scene in the whole shootout is also fake.

                   The reason I mentioned that scene is BECAUSE it's the only realistic scene. That was the point. To show how the only one realistic scene in the whole shootout is also fake.

                  You conveniently ignore the fact that immediately after shooting the woman in the gutter, he runs her over. Is that fake too? It only looks fake to you because you watch too many fucking (((movies.)))

                  So you've never shot anybody with a rifle, but know for certain what it's supposed to look like? I doubt you've ever fired a gun in your life, which explains why you don't know what muzzle rise is. Do you even know how big a bullet hole is? You don't need to have killed anybody to know, just gone to shoot paper down at the range.

               Are you one of those "I've never seen real shootings" people? I'd suggest get your head out of your ass and go watch on Liveleak shotgun and AK-47 shootings in 3rd world countries or police shootings and see the difference. Shotgun shots have chunks of meat going out of your body. Watch the first shotgun "victims" have no injury whatsoever.

               "Terrorist attacks" that play in the news have one thing in common. They are always PG-13.

                I'm one of those "I've seen thousands of shooting videos" people. This video is not inconsistent with many of those. And yes, this one doesn't have closeups of blood and flesh flying everywhere. You're free to think that happens with every gunshot, but I disagree.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sure, the entire video could be a poorly created false flag event that was presented "live" on faceberg, but I see no evidence for that. At that point, are we to question everything we see on video? What is the criteria for doubting? Atypical behavior? That kind of goes with the territory of a mass shooting, at least for most people.

             That was a misfire while he was driving in the car. That's why the windshield didn't shatter.

              If you mean shatter like a side or rear window does then you're wrong. Front windscreens in cars have a laminating layer of plastic between them to stop them from blowing out like side and rear windows do. The car in the video was a mid to late 2000s Subaru and from my experience with wrecking out Japanese cars all the ones I have parted have this style of windscreen and I cannot see why this particular car would have otherwise.

               By shatter I mean take no impact from the shotgun shell whatsoever.

              <p>
               He misfires his shotgun twice. No shell is properly expelled. That's why there's no damage to the windshield.

             I noticed that as well. Later on in the vid you can see the glass is broken. Possible a 20 gauge with slugs?

            The World Is Treated as One Big Plantation
           </p>
           <p>
            This article explores the scripting of the narratives of what we take to be real history. The mass media noise machine still makes use of the older media, like word of mouth and print, along with the newer electronic systems to screen reality from us. The News and other media is not designed to tell us the truth, it can happen, but the real purpose of it all is propaganda. We simply cannot trust the images and the narratives the governments, the media and the university systems offer us, without a whole lot of critical thought. "History" and current events, are more scripted and designed and are meant to keep us on a merry go round of fear forever. Old war stories get reimagined into modern news. It's all very contrived and seemingly on eternal repeat. Hollywood loves to redo old scripts after all. This article focuses on the scripting of the wars and history as we know it. It's not that we do not think wars occur, its just that we think the scale is smaller and that any violence would be over things like the local farmer not wanting the Coca Cola bottling plant on his land. The whole world has long been one managed Enterprise. The world wide public needs to be managed, or so these people think.
           </p>
           <p>
            We tend to think that whatever is or isn't going on in places like Syria, the whole thing is planned and controlled and contrived with the purpose of managing the public in those parts of the world, as well as using the news from these regions to color the minds of the western world. It's all one big false choice shadow puppet play. Any real revolutions are screened and filtered and managed by the system. The Military specializes in deception. We have to remember we need to believe we need all the protective layers of government we do not need. We have to think we need to keep paying taxes, fees and fines and even spend some jail time, if need be, for it all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Planning and conducting and calling for wars is a mental illness. We are not naturally war like like we've been sold. We are capable of acts of violence of course, but the wars as sold to us for centuries are more mythology than reality. Calling for bombing fellow human beings is a sickness of mind, calling for other sorts of mass produced violence is insane. We really need to defund this entire farce. We live in a managed fish bowl and we are stuck as wage slaves who exist in a state of eternal duress under candy coated tyrannical rule.
           </p>
           <p>
            Problem, reaction, solution is pushed by governments and their multimedia minions. We are not supposed to think rationally we are to respond emotionally. Advertising, film scripts, novels and even news stories, rely on this idea. Emotionally charged headlines and narratives are pushed hard to keep the public in a constant emotional state. The media promotes a real emotional roller coaster.

            Please excuse the stray type. We will correct them as we find them. Thank You. AA Morris Staff

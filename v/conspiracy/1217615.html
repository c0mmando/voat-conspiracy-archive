            It is sometimes hard to blame those uninformed. Many smart people are uninformed they have full time jobs, bills, and things to do with their lives. Many still see reddit as good source for news. They simply don't have time in their hectic lives to wake up.

             Totally correct. They count on that. Making sure that people don't have the time, or take the time to research things on their own and it's easier to accept  things that a person wants to believe.

            They media is not going to be held accountable by anyone except the people.  They need to be gutted, regulations need to be put in place making it criminal to deceive or lie to the people. For politicians too.  Alt is picking up and growing, but it might be to slow of a pace.

            They said Trump was going to rip up the GOP.  That turned out to be inaccurate. The DEM's though, is a broken party.  And should be.  I think the country would be fine or survive under Trump.  Not with Hillary.  And my family have been dem's for a long time. Die hard. My Gpa was a delegate at the DNC in 68 when they had the riots and in 72 in Mia.

            MSM has way too much brain-washing power over stupid and/or apathetic people.. They can make things seem more valid or important than they are.. Like BLM, or SJW crap, or telling every one we need to hate russia and go to war with them, or telling people we should all love israel and should shame any one who doubts the official holocaust story..
           </p>
           <p>
            There are tons of youtube channels and other videos on the internet that are far better to watch than the MSM, but the way it is set up now, it is just too convenient for people to turn on their televisions and start watching whatever propaganda is currently running.. And of course you will never find youtube-type (or other websites) channels on the TV.. As long as the TVs are constantly spouting their bullshit, some one some where is going to believe that crap.. Need to get rid of MSM some how, and replace it with REAL news..

             The MSM is a weapon.  An individual can turn it off, but they are still being assaulted along with everyone else.  If someone has a gun, just because you aren't looking at them doesn't mean they can't shoot you with it. They need to be stopped.  They are criminals by legal definition.  If the FCC isn't going to hold them accountable, the people should.
            </p>
            <p>
             The press was almost made a 4th branch of government and is the only business that has a constitutional amendment protecting it. The 1st one. Before the right to bare arms.  That is how important the founders viewed the press as.  To be a watch dog of the government for the people to keep them informed. They are no where near keeping the people informed.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are shills harming the people with propaganda that would make the former USSR blush.  Enough. We need to OCCUPY AND STOP THEM!  Call and tell them Im as mad as hell.....

              Dude - agree with all you say but it ain't just the media - although they are an obvious negative in current times.

             <p>
              What I mean is; it's society in general - we've got to blame the overall education of the majority.  It's not even about what is on TV anymore - it's more about the status of how big and flat you can have your brain-washing displayed on-screen.
             </p>
             <p>
              People can be led and it seems most are without realising they are (look at Pokemon-Go or Brexit), and in this way any meaningful change will always have a hard time because most people seeem to be a lot happier when they don't have to think too much.

               Material things don't mean a thing to me. But I am the exception to the rule. I don't have a cell phone. I didn't say smart phone. I said "cell phone".  I am on a system with xp.

               That being said, the reason the media is the problem is and

                need to be stopped is this.
               </a>
               That is who is in charge of the exit polling and determine the vote counts. Look no further that the consortium of MSM outlets that company is providing info to and understand that they are who is going to steal the election. HRC cannot do it with out them and that makes them an enemy, basically a traitor to the republic.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are right about the mass distraction that has been underway for a while, shit, it's almost football season, guilty as charged.  But the MSM is the worst weapon unleashed on us ever. They need to go and will be players in the demise of this republic and the constitution.  They cant do it by themselves, but it also cant be done without them.

            The people need to let them know the messenger will get slapped the fuck up if the message is lies. 24/7.  They are causing harm to the people, are criminals and need to be occupied.

            It is a war, and with that the first causality is always the truth.  This is no exception.  WAKE UP. FUCK THE MSM.  WE NEED TO TAKE THEM DOWN.  THEY WILL STEAL THE ELECTION FROM TRUMP AND THE PEOPLE.  NOW. YESTERDAY.

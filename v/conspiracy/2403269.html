             No, no, it should be abolished completely. There was no copyright when Mozart was alive and he still was creating. There was no copyright when Da Vinci or Shakespeare were alive and they did still create. Existence or not of copyright system of any kind has no bearing on actual creative processes of artists, it only useful for leeches wanting to generate profits from one work they did once upon a time or (worse still) for people who only have selling rights to a work they did not made. It also serves as a very good excuse for NWO agents who don't want certain voices to be heard, to silent them.

             I'm not pulling stuff out of my ass, mind you. NWO agents and reptilians do exist. You may laugh at me, you may ridicule me, but people would ridicule the idea of mind control experiments or that NSA spies on literally everyone, even allies until MKULTRA documents were released and until Snowden and (to a lesser extent) shadow brokers leaks happened.

             The only way we can. By downloading movies, games and so on from TPB instead of "official" sources, maybe with the exception of the independent creators that are either openly against NWO, such as David Icke or don't seem like government plants (many of the independent book writers or game creators, most of independent musicians, not sure how it is in case of indie film makers).
            </p>
            <p>
             If they won't see money from their copyright activities, they will back out. RIAA/MPAA, the big studios and labels are in it for the money, not because of NWO puppetry. If they can't get what the NWO agents promised them (increased sales once copyright is bullet-proof), they WILL back out, which will make NWO agents' position weaker and their promises less appealing next time they'll try anything similar.

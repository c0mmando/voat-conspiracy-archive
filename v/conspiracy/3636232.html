<p>Further according to a team of anthropologist, they have concluded that the black death of the 1300s was probably not the modern disease known as the bubonic plague.

<p>Martin Luther also accused jews of poisoning the wells.</p>
<p>Jewish doctors: </p>
<p>Year 1250 and onwards, medicine became the most common jewish profession after money lending. </p>
<p>\'\'It is well known the practice of medicine was widely spread among the Jews in the Middle Ages. Some two thousand jewish physicians who flourished in this period have been recorded, and the list is manifestly incomplete.\'\'  
</p>
<p>\'\'As is well known, a very large number of the Jewish rabbis of the Middle Ages, from Maimonides downwards, were at the same time physicians, who attached themselves to these distinguished scholars for the purpose of instruction in rabbinic lore, also learned what they had to teach in medical science and accompanied them on their professional visits. Thus they would attain a certain medical competence, and, if they felt so inclined, could become medical practicioners themselves in due course.\'\'</p>
<p>So a lot of these jewish physicians were religious and followers of the Talmud. Magister Elias of London (13th century), profilic writer on Jewish law, was also a highly-esteemed physician in Gentile circles. </p>
<p>\'\'In 1443, Vitalis Cohen, himself a physician, to teach medicine and Jewish lore (i.e Talmud?) for a year to five youths, their sons, for a fee of ten\'\'</p>
<p>Source: The Qualification of Jewish Physicians in the Middle Ages- Cecil Roth. </p>
<p>\'\'In the 13th and 14th centuries there was a great concentration of Jewish physicians in Southern France\'\'. Also \'\'Jewish teachers educated in Moorish spain transmitted their knowledge to Southern French students while teaching at the medical school in Montpellier. They also distinguished themselves in religious learning and in the practice of medicine in local community\'\' </p>
<p>Again, notice how these jewish physicians are actively religious. </p>
<p>Source: Jewish physicians in Southern France during the 13th and 14th centuries- Isaac Alteras.  
</p>
<p>Jewish law does not allow jews to heal Gentiles and it permits jews to poision Gentiles because to cause a death that\'s not instantaneous is not considered murder according to Talmudic law. Jews being prominent in the area of medicine at this time could mean that they had an understanding of how to create a poison that could cause diseases which were very fatal and could spread easily. Notice how many of these confessions named Rabbis as giving orders and reading from the source above, many doctors were also Rabbis. </p>
<p>It\'s also curious that the death rate from the plague among jews was significantly less compared that to the Christian death rate. This was a disease that was highly contagious and was not discriminatory so how come jews were less affected by it? Even if jews lived in seperate communities, they still were in contact with gentiles who they made business with for exploitation and because of the disease being non-discrimatory and widely spread, it should have affected them just as much but it didn\'t. Also many of the Plague doctors did not get infected by this disease, i doubt their outfit provided them that much protection against it. Did some of them have some type of immunization? For example, Nostradamus who was a jewish physician, was immune to the plague...</p>
<p>Here is a map of how widespread the black death was in Europe; </p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/3e58cn.png">https://files.catbox.moe/3e58cn.png</a> </p>
<p>As we can see, the entirety of Europe was affected expect the Polish area, why was this area spared from this increadibly highly contagious disease? </p>
<p>Because Poland was a safe haven for the jews during this period and periods before that. Poland had offered jews fleeing \'\'persecution\'\' that they had experienced in other parts of Europe shelter, it was the go to country if they got caught with their crimes. Much like how Israel functions today. And they were also freely allowed to engage in their economic criminal activities which made them very rich in Poland. So of course Poland would be exempt from the Black Death if we are to believe that jews were behind it because Poland offered no to little resistence against hemand a big concentration of jews lived there as well. By the 15th century, the majority of European jews resided primarily in Poland.</p>

           Martin Luther also accused jews of poisoning the wells.
          </p>
          <p>
           Jewish doctors:
          </p>
          <p>
           Year 1250 and onwards, medicine became the most common jewish profession after money lending.
          </p>
          <p>
           ''It is well known the practice of medicine was widely spread among the Jews in the Middle Ages. Some two thousand jewish physicians who flourished in this period have been recorded, and the list is manifestly incomplete.''
          </p>

          <p>
           ''In the 13th and 14th centuries there was a great concentration of Jewish physicians in Southern France''. Also ''Jewish teachers educated in Moorish spain transmitted their knowledge to Southern French students while teaching at the medical school in Montpellier. They also distinguished themselves in religious learning and in the practice of medicine in local community''
          </p>

           Again, notice how these jewish physicians are actively religious.

           Jewish law does not allow jews to heal Gentiles and it permits jews to poision Gentiles because to cause a death that's not instantaneous is not considered murder according to Talmudic law. Jews being prominent in the area of medicine at this time could mean that they had an understanding of how to create a poison that could cause diseases which were very fatal and could spread easily. Notice how many of these confessions named Rabbis as giving orders and reading from the source above, many doctors were also Rabbis.

           It's also curious that the death rate from the plague among jews was significantly less compared that to the Christian death rate. This was a disease that was highly contagious and was not discriminatory so how come jews were less affected by it? Even if jews lived in seperate communities, they still were in contact with gentiles who they made business with for exploitation and because of the disease being non-discrimatory and widely spread, it should have affected them just as much but it didn't. Also many of the Plague doctors did not get infected by this disease, i doubt their outfit provided them that much protection against it. Did some of them have some type of immunization? For example, Nostradamus who was a jewish physician, was immune to the plague...

           Here is a map of how widespread the black death was in Europe;

          <p>
           As we can see, the entirety of Europe was affected expect the Polish area, why was this area spared from this increadibly highly contagious disease?
          </p>
          <p>
           Because Poland was a safe haven for the jews during this period and periods before that. Poland had offered jews fleeing ''persecution'' that they had experienced in other parts of Europe shelter, it was the go to country if they got caught with their crimes. Much like how Israel functions today. And they were also freely allowed to engage in their economic criminal activities which made them very rich in Poland. So of course Poland would be exempt from the Black Death if we are to believe that jews were behind it because Poland offered no to little resistence against hemand a big concentration of jews lived there as well. By the 15th century, the majority of European jews resided primarily in Poland.

            Do we have any good guesses to what they poisoned the people with? One of the confessed said black/red and another said black/green. I don’t know anything about this but it seems likely true if they confessed and knew intricate otherwise unknowable details.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reminds me of the Damascus affair and how the Jews killed Christian kids. The confessors led them to the body. They just keep everything hidden from our brainwashed society, they want us to continue being slaves while they put their multicultural puppets in place before the eventual re-education and extermination camps are setup.

             Unfortunately i have no good guesses on what kind of poison they used, only that it was increadibly potent. Yes, that is true. The confessions are way too detailed for anyone to just gloss them over, specially when you consider the fact that jews were less affected by it and the confessions gave us an explanaition as to why that is (many jews were told not to drink from the poisoned well water) and that Poland, the safe haven of the jews at that time was spared (jews not poisoning the well there).
            </p>
            <p>
             It's understandable why jews are obsessed with controlling all flow of information when they have such a dark history. If people knew the extent of the crimes that they've commited through out history, they would be finished.

             This does not really dismiss my conclusion. Just because the public did not have knowledge needed in what precautions to take to help reduce the risks of getting sick does not mean there was not a certain few that didn't know. You are going by the bullshit narrative that mainstream history have set up which is that the ancients were nothing more than stupid idiots that didn't know much about anything. Medicine has been practiced for many thousands of years, Ancient Greece was well known for its practices of medicine, there are even records of cataract surgery done in Ancient Greece which is a delicate surgery.. There are also records of them being able to drain fluid from lungs. Trepanation is an ancient practice and many of the skulls has been found with the skull structure showing healing meaning that they had survived the brain surgery.. Skulls with trepanation done on them found in Peru northern highlands from 1000 CE. and 1300 CE showed that they had a survival rate of 91% while skulle found from 400 BC to 200 BC had just 40% survival rate. Meaning that they must have had decent knowledge about medicine and biology since ancient time and had kept improving their methods of this brain surgery. In Ancient India and China it was a common practice to deliberately expose people to smallpox, usually to a mild form of the disease.. meaning they had knowledge of inoculation. Knights Templar which had a cozy relationship with jews had an understanding of hygiene and antibiotics and understood that epilepsy was a controllable disease and not a demonic possession, showing a good understanding of medicine before the spread of the Black Death.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also when it comes to sewer systems, an advanced sewer system was already put in place dating back to atleast to the times of the Indus Valley Civilization. So an importance of hygiene and cleanlines as well as other important knowledge about medicine dates way back. Jews have existed for many thouands of years and have been migrating to many parts of the world and formed an international network dating back to ancient times, jews in many societies they sleazy their way into managed to usually reach high positions of power, usually as an advisor to the rulers or as powerful money lenders.. You don't think they had access to ancient information about medicine and biology kept that knowledge from the public and found a way to create a powerful poision? It is certainly a possibility and all these admissions of poisioning the well is not something to just gloss over either. Hell, we don't even know the amount of knowledge we lost in the Library of Alexandria.

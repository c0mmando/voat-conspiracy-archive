           I know I'm a little late to the party, but I was watching a documentary on the USAF today, and they were talking about how strict the radio communication standards are for pilots. This brought to mind the Navy pilot UFO footage, where I recalled words like "bro" and "dude" being used. It's reported that the planes were F-18 hornets (single person cockpits), so we can be sure this was indeed radio chatter. I find their choice of words a little strange, even considering that they had no idea what they were looking at.

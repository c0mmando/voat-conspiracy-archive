            Another was 'There are no forests on Flat Earth', which decided that mountains are tree stumps and canyons are ancient quarries. And another that dinosaurs didn't exist. All these vectors have been heavily promoted by the same YT characters. There are also a fair number of dupes who've climbed on board, as well as the shill commenters you mentioned. To see how pervasive the FE meme is, just go to Google and look up Flat Earth psyop. All the 'psyops' that come up are FE promoters who take a slightly different spin. And on YT, as soon as you search for FE psyop videos, your feed fills up with pro-FE videos. This thing is being pushed at a ridiculous level!

            the 'Zeitgeist' centralized computer system is (basically) used by some advanced races around the galaxies.
           </p>
           <p>
            it is far from efficient and far from a driver of innovation especially for a humanoid type DNA container.
           </p>
           <p>
            basically I'm saying even the 'Apes' on Earth can do much much better and if we get it right , humans can be very great!
I mean significant in this galaxy and even beyond.
           </p>
           <p>
            if not humans are just another failure.

           <p>
            i am not seeing what you're seeing - i do not see, anywhere, Peter trying to promote a communist agenda, at all ... not even close
           </p>
           <p>
            i think this is the result of peoples desire to attach a label to an idea that is relatively new which doesn't fall under under any existing category - he is a thinker and a futurist, but absolutely not even remotely a communist or capitalist, at least certainly not in any sense of the traditional definitions
           </p>
           <p>
            his idea of a better world is the adoption of entirely new systems, not the reworking of existing ones, such as communism
           </p>
           <p>
            i skimmed through parts of the vid you linked to 'Zeitgeist, History Rewritten' - Chris White seems to base his rebuttal entirely around religion and Jesus, which is totally not anywhere near the center of the Zeitgeist movement - Peter's discussion regarding religion was only intended to wake up those who have been co-opted (enslaved) by the political tool of religion with the intention of moving forward, not to debate whether Jesus did this or that or said x or y or z because it doesn't matter - the philosophy is not about religion and if you're positing that Peter is for the destruction of blind -- and i emphasize BLIND -- faith, than yes, i absolutely agree and support his view - does this coincide with communism? of course. does is make his idea communist in nature? of course not!  you have to listen to all of what he says
           </p>
           <p>
            you said yourself; "I care about whether the person presenting a bunch of information and trying to lead some kind of apparently communist movement"
           </p>
           <p>
            i agree and i am not stating as fact that Peter isn't a tool of a higher authority, but when i listen to his talks and his ideas there are a few things that are very readily apparent to me....
           </p>
           <p>
            1) he is highly intelligent which affords him at least some credibility assuming he is also ethical
           </p>
           <p>
            2) his ideas align closely with those of Fresco, which is a
            <em>
             totally
            </em>
            new system that has (so far as i know) never existed before and therefore cannot easily be labeled
           </p>
           <p>
            3) his ideas are certainly not communist, socialist or capitalist in nature, yet they do
            <em>
             borrow
            </em>
            form all of these, and more
           </p>
           <p>
            4) there are no central banks or oppressive governments in a system which is dictated, not by corporations (lobbyists), but by available resources and
            <em>
             science
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            5) he has studied, in depth, the problems with our current social, monetary and political systems and seems to offer viable, sensible alternatives that would free mankind from the bondages of greed
           </p>
           <p>
            having said that, if there is evidence in the video you linked to that Peter is a communist, let me know and i'll happily watch the entire thing, but if it's all about religion, i couldn't give a fuck because religion, like it or not, IS going to disappear - the only question is whether it's going to disappear for the right reasons

             'communist' or not 'communist' it's a centralized failure of a system that is mismatched to a humanoid DNA container.
            </p>
            <p>
             it may work for a few 100 yrs but then it would fail as it is a mismatch for the humanoid.  'trust me'

            interesting comment
           </p>
           <p>
            while i strongly disagree with your comment regarding Peter Joseph and the Zeitgeist movement (have you spent much time
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TZMOfficialChannel/videos">
             listening to his talks
            </a>
            ?), i very much agree that the ball is ultimately in the hands of the (powerful) individual
           </p>
           <p>
            plant a garden and disconnect from the fuckin' 'system' as much as possible is my advice

             I have designed a system superior to the 'Zeitgeist' system .
            </p>
            <p>
             It is not centralised and it is not 'run by a computer' it is also freedom based.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately (for them) some people will think it is the 'beast' 'Antichrist' system.

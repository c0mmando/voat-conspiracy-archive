           </p>
           <p>
            6) the moon landings never happened. Also most if not all of NASAs missions are fake and the apollo mission where a teacher and others died was a hoax the people are still alive.

            11) some of the elite and powerful are theoretical vampires since the do consume human blood in the search of the fountain of youth, also the clone themselves as an attempt at eternal life.
           </p>
           <p>
            12) scientists went back and tested the DNA of pharoahs and now the elite have taken the DNA of some of those pharoahs and used cloning technology to make modern day celebrity replicas of them.
           </p>

            TL;DR - A map redrawing borders in the Middle East is published in 2006. Then nearly a decade later Syria has a civil war which is funded by foreign powers that could lead to the map becoming reality.
           </p>
           <p>
            The refugee crisis and the problems the world is having right now are a result of trying to create the
            <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/articlePictures/The%20Project%20for%20the%20New%20Middle%20East.jpg">
             New Middle East
            </a>
            . Here's
            <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/plans-for-redrawing-the-middle-east-the-project-for-a-new-middle-east/3882">
             an article
            </a>
            that was written back in 2006 that talks about it. (But remember when reading it, that it was written in 2006, and things change over time.)
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Already the legislative framework, under the Iraqi Parliament and the name of Iraqi federalization, for the partition of Iraq into three portions is being drawn out. - From the article linked above which was written in 2006.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So it was decided back then that Iraq would split into Shia Iraq, Sunni Islamic State, and the new Kurdish state. But according to the map the Sunni Islamic State and the Kurdish State extended into Syria. They lie and claim the cause of the civil war isn't wanting to make the map a reality, it's because Syria is attacking its own people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let's talk about the Kurdish Sate and the Sunni Islamic State. If you want to live in the Sunni Islamic State all you have to do is convert to Sunni Islam. The Kurdish state is different. To have a Kurdish state, all of the people need to be Kurdish. Which is an ethnicity. So to have a Kurdish State, they must ethnically cleans the area of everyone who isn't Kurdish. They can murder them, or force them out. All out genocide will sway public opinion, so they kill as many as they can and force the rest to relocate becoming refugees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Canada is currently
            <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?=fs&amp;q=canadian+military+and+the+kurds&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=P2yWWJKZJ6jz8wf6h5qgDw">
             arming, funding, training, and actually fighting alongside the Kurds
            </a>
            . You may have heard about the kid who shot up a mosque in Canada a few days ago. With the possibility of Trump not taking in enough Syrian refugees, that means Canada will have to take significantly more. Because of that (possibly false flag) attack, they will be able to silence any opposition to the amount of refugees they bring in and the ethnic cleansing of what is to become the Kurdish state can continue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything happening in the Middle East can be linked back to that map. It's just tough to know which side people are on. Turkey had that coup (or fake coup) last year. Where the President gained even more power. So that might be to prevent them losing 1/4 of their country to the Kurds, or to guarantee it's handed over. What's happening with (or what's being truthfully or falsely reported about) Iran? They might be trying to justify forcing Iran to split. Or Iran is preparing to prevent it.
           </p>
           <p>
            With Russia fighting ISIS (but not fighting the Kurds, which is suspicious) and Trump saying that he'll work with Russia and take out ISIS. Hopefully the idea of redrawing the borders is scrapped. Hopefully. Only time will tell.

            My thinking is if Big Pharma gets caught hiding a rival drug that is far more effective (and cheaper), in order to create a monopoly and jack up the price of their drug.......and get caught.   What else are they hiding from the public???   ....A cure for Aids?   A cure for protstate cancer?   A  non-addictive pain killers?   Suddenly these "crazy" conspiracies of the past seem more plausible than not.

            There is the conspiracy that big pharma witholds cures and or far more effective drugs from the market in order to sell symptom relieving drugs that only block pain when they know full well their other drug is far more effective.   -  Well last week wall-street journal had an article about a drug company that did just this and is being sued big time.  -  I'll look for article now.

             that's not a conspiracy theory at all - it's a fact - i can give some resources if interested, but one thing you can research yourself is chlorine dioxide which is dirt cheap to make and has been used to cure many thousands of people of a huge-ass variety of diseases, especially malaria - even the Red Cross ran a trial using it in an attempt to debunk its benefits - when all of the patients they treated became malaria free, they publicly denied they ever conducted the tests (too bad for them, some of it was videoed)
            </p>
            <p>
             our whole world is centered around greed and as long as that is the case, it will always be far more profitable to "manage" disease than cure it

              Like the U.S gov. refusing to allow medical testing of apricot seeds for cancer curing properties.   That's a doozy of a rabbit hole to go down, but go and ask an oncologist about what happens when a MD tries to study natural cancer killing techniques....They are met with the full wrath of AMA.

               not sure i ever heard of using apricot seeds to treat cancer, but then again, i kind of gave up on looking for alternative cures because there's so many of them and at least some of them have supporting evidence - here's just a few links i've collected...

             I'm not an astroturfer, Reddit wouldn't let me say anything like this so I went to live leak, also, if I unprivate my older videos, you would see what I think.

             yeah, it's called the "amalek effect" - i tend to be very weary of &lt; 40 day accounts myself, but if we want more people, maybe we ought to be a little more tolerant because they're not all amalek's ... i hope :)

             a lot, why the difference in races is ignored, if the jews really took over banking everywhere they went like i heard, why our corporations seem to be jumping ship by draining all the money they make from here without paying taxes, how women age worse than men and are not as ambitious so should be inside out of the sun pretty much like an object, who people have a tribe mentality where everyone else you meet after a point just seems like a archetype of a person, i dunno, the globalism, i believe in individualism. sorry this is too mixed up

              i'm not really sure - economics: the surface reasons are obvious; cheap labor, lower taxes, cheaper materials, less regulation - but i don't think i really know the deeper reasons that i suspect you're questioning
             </p>
             <p>
              you also have the average American who thinks they're saving money by buying the same piece of garbage from China 3 times instead of paying 50% more for something that will last much longer - but part of that can be attributed to being poor which, in turn, can be attributed to several other circumstances, not the least of which is the Jewish bankers that regulate the [percieved] value of the worthless paper we call "money"

              as for ambition, i would readily argue that women are every bit as ambitious as men, just about different things - men are more service-to-self oriented - what's in it for ME? - where women are more service-to-others oriented - how can i help? now who would you rather have running shit? and consider where we are, as well as where we could be before answering

             <p>
              really though, i think this comes down to two things; 1) lack of a real education and 2) greed - the way the entire planet is run is based on greed - only when that is removed from the equation will we be able to really explore our human potential - and while you can once again thank the Jewish bankers for this, IN PART, they are not the root cause for why we center ourselves around greed

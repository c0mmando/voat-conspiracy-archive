When officials were asked about why there were no affordable facilities, they sued contractors as they are financially interested in bid rigging the corporate and residential real estate markets as investors in the rental economy.</p>
<p>Those same liberal officials were found to have extensive rental properties available as sublets only. They have an interest in keeping the corrupt laws in place driving even the sole power provider out of the rental market for facility space.</p>
<p>Someone at the DOJ has to prosecute Ventura County officials. They are making a KILLING renting temporary shared out space to contractors that keep rotating through a revolving door just to keep the lights and internet on.</p>
<p>The brilliant officials out here now blame Southern California Edison for the Thomas Fire. NO INVESTIGATION. Just a lawsuit by top earning officilas against the utility provider. Even as the same city and county officials REFUSED to rule several cases in the favor of SCE and other key infrastructure contractors because the money was too good to do otherwise. Now those same officials, while protecting the same people the Feds have warrants out for in their sanctuary cities are suing our only electricity provider.</p>
<p>LOCK THESE OFFICIALS UP BEFORE WE BECOME TIANJIN.</p>
<p>It isn\'t SCE\'s fault. They did everything they could to gain access to adequate facilities and they were not only blocked by a brigade of liberal officials, they were also sued and persecuted for reporting these violations by this county.</p>
<p>SCE didn\'t start the fire.</p>
<p>There\'s so many Arabs here it feels like I live in Saudi Fucking Arabia.</p>
<p>Here\'s my footage of the fire.</p>
<p>THIS WAS IN MY BACKYARD!
<a href="https://vimeo.com/249265728">https://vimeo.com/249265728</a></p>
<p>A judge and a few officials (all liberal) whose million dollar beach houses on the hill with a view burnt. So now they\'ve decided to blame SCE even though they ended up being forced to use a temporary service yard because no leases were available that met regulation. All the high rents were because the illegal investors those officials sponsored became predatory racketeer investors and drove up rents so not even utility contractors can afford a space. They caused this. Now they want to blame our service economy.</p>
<p>The officials out here all want to push their environmental agenda.</p>
<p>If they\'re that stupid, the arsonists are going to move on to transformers while SCE defends themselves against fabricated bullshit brought by triple dip officials in Ventura County. What we\'re about to witness is the begnnings of a nasty turf war begun by angry liberal officials whose policies have the masses lighting up the hillside in flames against our only infrastructure and energy workers. That\'s what the liberals want, to sue the utilities so that no one can have water or power. Imprison them for corruption - they won\'t evict the illegal sanctuary people from their homes, they pay them and let them pillage - then they strawman the collateral damage and pin it on our utility service provider? Fuck that.</p>
<p>That\'s the same thing they did in Europe and now the snackbars are lighting fireworks at people at driving on sidewalks. The liberal socialists all have committed war crimes.</p>
<p>The same horde that invaded Europe has corrupted our officials. This is war and they know it.</p>
<p>I say if they want us to do without they have to also.</p>
<p>I would go as far as to ask SCE to bring a strongarm case against Ventura County over bid rigging corporate rental real estate. SCE has to protect themselves as I don\'t believe they started a fire - Ventura forced them to work out of a fucking local park field that wasnt used instead of charging the bad investors with fraud and racketeering. Instead of filing charges on these investors, they contracted to them and attempted to force the existing providers out.</p>
<p>Right by my house SCE is being forced to work out of a temporary field because they can\'t rent space due to corruption in the corporate rental markets. The city decided to use that as a means to pull an environmental agenda and I\'d say they let that fire burn to get maximum FEMA payout.</p>
<p>Mark my words, the FEMA money will go only to liberal marxist officials and no one else. They\'re going to use that money to sue our sole utility providers.</p>
<p>Tell the Ventura county 1% officials whose homes burnt in the fire to stop playing politics and solve the fucking crimes in their county. Tell them that suing our utility providers is a scapegoat move that will bring them federal corruption charges by the thousands of counts if they want to continue their scorched earth revenge.</p>
<p>EDISON WOULD HAVE HAD TO DISPATCH FROM LOS ANGELES TO MOVE OUT OF THAT TEMP YARD. WHY CAN\'T OUR OWN UTILITY SERVICES AFFORD THE GOD DAMN RENT IN YOUR FUCKED MARKET??</p>
<p>If the county is going to sue Edison over the Thomas Fire they\'re going to have a war on their hands. All Edison will likely strike until they no longer have to use the Temp service yard because liability. The city made ZERO EFFORT to help Edison get adequate facilities. NONE. Sue their ass for that.</p>',

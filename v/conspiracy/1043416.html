            I'm 10000% with you on the drug part. There's a reason psychedelics are illegal. They help you see the truth and realize what's real in this world and what isn't.

            One tough pill to swallow I know my friend. Just know nothing matters in the material world and no one can judge you for anything. The truth will set you free. Anyone judging you is just hurting themselves. Society conforms to society. Just nope out of society or continue playing the game. I will continue to play the game, slowly and surely more and more will catch on.

              They likely did. Except the theory of aliens is different than you are expecting. It might be that there are multiple dimensions all around us.

            I look at the clouds in the sky and see no curving. I look at fake earth photos on google. I found out the moon landing is fake. I found out hardly anyone goes to Antarctica, no adventurers I presume. Flight paths that curve to the earth just go in straight lines on the flat earth map.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those are my main points I use and counter arguments to them seem to stand no chance. I thought I was going crazy when I had half this information. But I kept going something just told me to. Then one day I googled translated my last name and I found out fate is a real thing. San vi do = Saint I give you. God bless everyone.

             Knowing the truth and still playing the game &gt; Knowing a lie and still playing the game. Do your research friend there is a lot for you to look into here, it's a guide don't take it as the full truth if you do not want to. Also they will not hang me. They know who their lords are after they sell their soul. They would not dare.

             Think whatever you want but if there was any real truth behind it I'd believe it. The more truth I found it finally clicked one day that space is bullcrap, that's why the globe is in every class room and you hear about all this alien life UFO crap. Who would have guessed Nikolas Tesla invented a UFO in 1890 and it never came to light. They used that technology as a cover for outer space.

<p>State Department Employee Exposed In Project Veritas Deep State Sting</p>
<p>FIRST VIDEOYouTube</p>
<p>BACKUP</p>
<p>James O\'Keefe and his undercover investigators have once again exposed extreme left-wing activists pursuing a progressive agenda within a position of power - this time infiltrating the State Department.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.projectveritas.com/2018/09/18/deep-state-unmasked-state-department-on-hidden-cam-resist-everything-i-have-nothing-to-lose/">https://www.projectveritas.com/2018/09/18/deep-state-unmasked-state-department-on-hidden-cam-resist-everything-i-have-nothing-to-lose/</a></p>
<p>Today, Project Veritas released the first installment in an undercover videoinvestigation series unmasking the deep state. This video features a State Department employee, Stuart Karaffa, engaged in radical socialist political activity on the taxpayer’s dime, while advocating for resistance to official government policies. In addition to being a State Department employee Stuart Karaffa is also a ranking member of the Metro DC Democratic Socialists of America (Metro DC DSA.)</p>
<p>Metro DC DSA is a socialist group that works to advance progressive causes in the metropolitan DC area.</p>
<p>Mr. Karaffa’s loyalties seem to be with DSA, not with his employer.</p>
<p>Karaffa told an undercover Project Veritas journalist that he performs DSA activism while at work for the State Department. He explained that he drafts DSA communications while on the job at State Department:</p>
<p>“… I’m careful about it. I don’t leave a paper trail, like I leave emails, and like any press s**t that comes up I leave that until after 5:30. But as soon as 5:31 hits, got my like draft messages ready to send out.”</p>
<p>Karaffa also admits that on behalf of DSA he monitors Virginia political news online while at work:</p>
<p>“You could put two and two together probably. With like web traffic…. So with web traffic, I mean I could make the case before a court of law that- I’m going to the Virginia sort of, campaign finance website- that I’m just interested in what people are doing politically. But if they also go and look at like DSA minutes and like Officer positions they’ll be like, ‘that’s weird, you were the co-chair of the electoral caucus, and you spent three hours on a Virginia campaign finance website.\'”</p>
<p>Karaffa does not believe that he will be caught and punished by the appropriate authorities, saying, “Maybe someday I’ll go to board of elections jail, probably not.”</p>
<p>Karaffa does not seem to be concerned about disciplinary action from the State Department: “I have nothing to lose. It’s impossible to fire federal employees.” When asked if his supervisor at the State Department knows about his activism, Karaffa reveals that “nobody knows” about it.</p>
<p>Some government employees are required to regularly submit disclosure forms to help management identify any potential conflicts of interest that may interfere with job responsibilities. Despite disclosing his political activities and officer positions on his financial disclosure form, Karaffa alleges that:</p>
<p>“… somebody just rubber stamps [the form] and it goes forward… I don’t know if [the ethics officer is] all there. He’s so checked out…”</p>
<p>&quot;… I’m careful about it. I don’t leave a paper trail, like I leave emails, and like any press s**t that comes up I leave that until after 5:30.

            Watched all 3 Project Veritas releases on exposing the deep state.  Federal Unions are a HUGE part of the swamp.  President Trump issued either an EO or a EM to at stop federal employees from working full time for the Fed Unions.  I think it is tied up in court.  Federal Union contracts are similar to U1 or Iran Deal.  Awful for us but great for the corrupt,

            I hear these people are rarely fired. Makes me sick that they work for US and hate the system that gives them good jobs. I'd fire every single one that's found.

            I wonder if they are actively recruited because they are evil and communist or if they come into a corrupted 'SWAMP' atmosphere and soon 'Johnny Wholesome American' is corrupted by the constant peer pressure and mental abuse and manipulation. Look at the 'GOOGLE' tapes, with that same air of 'How right they are', it is like a parasite that takes over the host and leaves them insane!

            They're all a bunch of socialists trying to sabotage our great nation. USA needs no socialism at all... that simple.

            You'd think all the evidence historically and in realtime (Venezuela, Cuba...) would clue them into socialism being a failed ideology for fucks sake.

            The State Department aren't communists or socialists - they just control any left-leaning orgs in America. They also control these orgs by supplying them with children for sex blackmail. I don't think the State Department would let O'Keeffe investigate that branch of Pizzagate.

            Per the Communist Control Act of 1954, it is illegal to be openly communist. It's a shame our (((legal system))) never enforced this.

             Came here to post this.  I only think it should be actively enforced on representatives and employees of the federal and state governments though.

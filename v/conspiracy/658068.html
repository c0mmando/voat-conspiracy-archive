  'formattedContent' => '<p>Well lets look at who has anything to gain from attacks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The terrorists themselves, if they did have some &quot;greater cause&quot; that they wanted to push</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right and anti immigrant movement will gain a huge influx of support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conservatives will have an easier time passing surveilance and police laws</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secret services will have more freedom to spy on people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warmongers will have an easier time to call for a new, proper war in the middle east. No suprise if the NATO invades Syria off the back of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defense and weapon industry will a) sell more guns to the people, who now feel less protected by the government and b) would profit hugely from a new war</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone who wants the TPP and possibly also the TTIP to pass has gotten a nice distraction as they always do when something new happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Now lets look at who <em>definitely</em> doesnt have any gains from the attack, so as to exclude them from involvement theories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anti-surveilance movements will have a harder time reasoning against systematic spying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pro-immigration movements will lose massive amounts of support</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Finally lets make some educated guesses about which of the parties that have anything to gain, are actually able to pull something like this off:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ISIS themselves have shown to be competent enough to carry out attacks on western cities, however an attack on such a scale has never happened before in recent history, and it would seem unlikely to not have been uncovered beforehand. They may have at least been supported by other parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right? I think this is the one we can eliminate from the list. There is no right-wing terror cell organized enough to pull this off without anyone noticing. They are the least likely to be supported by a bigger organization. However I find it possible that on of the intentions was to use them as pawns for the backlash against the refugee shelters, even if they most likely didnt know they were being used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conservatives? Possible but unlikely. They dont have the means to bring weapons into the country unnoticed without being exposed themselves. They are under far too much surveilance themselves, and I believe that for them the attack was just a lucky coincidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The secret service? Hell yes they have the means to do this kind of thing. Either by helping already hyped ISIS fanatics getting guns into fance, or directly by using their own people. The latter would either mean that the attackers have gotten away, or that they didnt know they were meant to die in the end, so I find it less likely than them arming an helping ISIS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warmongers? I think they are mostly just unoprganized nationalists and lack the funds to arm their own enemy just to spread fear. I also doubt they would think that that many Europeans would justify even a full scale attack on middle eastern countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least the weapons industry definitley does have something big to gain from this <em>and</em> has the means to fund it. If they are involved they probably did so by proxy, via secret services, but their involvement is highly likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people involved with the TPP probably dont have the means to covertly carry out such an attack, but they may well have connections that can. However the attack will only push them from the frontpages for a few months, so it may be too cost-inefficient for them. They also are after all people, so such a short timeframe of more secrecy may not actually be worth 100something dead people in Europe. They definitely care about money a lot, but probably not to the point where theyd be so rotten as to not even give a shit about that many human beings.</p>

            It's a better list than I thought you'd make.
           </p>
           <p>
            You subjectively slant toward surveillance proponents as instigators, and downplay IS[IS]-and-mindshare.  VIolent actions of this scale are carried out in every military operation by ISIS, etc - even bokoharam, and others.  Doing so in a Western country only made it take longer to synchronize.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the arrest in Germany last week, I have every reason to think that the other actors were nervous about being caught, too, and put the plan into execution (without waiting for more fighters)

            TPP distraction? Billions to gain by the elite from the TPP passing. Saying that, not sure when it's next being voted on.

             Ill add it to the "who has anything to gain" list. Could they have the means to act out such an attack on their own? Not sure but they do seem to have influence on groups who may.

             I though Israel to pretty much belong to the "warmonger" category but obviously with the means of the Mossad. Through this they most likely actually have the means to conduct a false flag operation in Europe. So: good point there.

             I dont really have the time to listen to the entire podcast so if you could please explain what you mean by Gladio B Id be very thankful.

               I see. Sounds close to the theory of which whoever controls the entirety of the "Heartland" aka Eurasia controls the world. As long as Eurasia is split between rival powers, governments outside of it (like the US) are in control.
              </p>
              <p>
               Seeing as how Europe and Asia are getting closer and closer politically but also culturally this would justify a fals flag like this absolutely as long as it divides Europe, Russia and the middle east.

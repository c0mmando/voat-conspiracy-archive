            I think you're onto something, although you haven't quite nailed it down. Somebody ... some group, some force, some entity, who knows? ... wants to limit human intelligence. Or maybe it would be more useful to say that the way our universe and the life it in are set up
            <em>
             automatically
            </em>
            put a cap on intelligence. It's a kind of feedback mechanism. The more intelligent a culture becomes, the more self-destructive it becomes. Are there groups within that culture actively working to hinder and limit its advancement? Sure, that's obvious. What is less clear is whether those groups are initiating the regression in intelligence, or are merely a part of it unfolding. Take Jews (please). We can all see that they are doing enormous harm to Western culture. Many individual Jews are doing it deliberately and are reveling in it. But could they have initiated the damage on their own? Or are they merely acting as unwitting agents of some more covert, sinister intelligence? Or, third possiblity, are they just cogs in some preexisting social mechanism that is inherently designed to initiate the degradation of Western society when we advance beyond a certain point? Was the Moon landing the trigger? No, the parts of the mechanism were already in place before 1969. The Moon landing is the symbol of the highest point in Western civilization. It's downhill from here, folks.

             i believe the UN is behind this and when people come to power but arent manipulated by the usual tools (money, power, etc) then theyre shown the data.
            </p>
            <p>
             im saying this becsuse while most politicians lie some seem very genuine - yet a few month after being in power they seem scared and stop doing what they promised.
of course it could be other things like threat of death, but i dont think so

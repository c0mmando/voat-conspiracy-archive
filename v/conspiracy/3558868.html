            Aside from being an excellent candidate for "most interesting man in the world" was a super smart fella. I had the pleasure of meeting him several times. Through all his gene research he developed the notion that genetic disease might be eliminated through targeted gene therapy. For instance, let's pick lung cancer, a disease that maybe environmental but is also commonly genetic. If the gene can be isolated and a repair(on/off) sequence manufactered the resulting cure could be put in a pill or injection and be administered to the patient specifically, because the cure was for your individual ailment/gene sequence. He also speculated a pill that could "therapy" all genetic disease could be developed, (especially) cancer. At the time I wondered about what nefarious action this could be used for, but he seemed a really altruistic guy and laughed it off. There was an interview article on the topic in an industry pub years ago, but may have been memory holed(I haven't been able to find it, if I do I'll update) I don't think he was an "asset" himself but several of his partners definitely were spooks. And one was probably a Chinese infiltrator now that I'm thinking back on it.... Oh well
           </p>
           <p>
            You may find some of his papers interesting
           </p>
           <p>
            In the mean time, he's dead and no longer in control of his patents or companies, non-individual gene therapy is scary as fuck and I want nothing to do with it

            I think that "every attack" is a bit of a stretch. But, the system in place certainly influenced the seeds of terrorism to grow. I'll compare it to mass shootings. Some people think that Sandy Hook was a hoax. I am extremely hesitant to believe that; I do believe that TPTB nurtured an atmosphere, through careful media presentation and legislation (including abandoning mentally ill individuals to the wolves) where mass shootings are inevitable. Why risk hoaxing it when you can just create a system where it's going to happen and then rapidly react to crack down on whatever your goals are? Same for terrorist attacks, like the Boston bombers. They jumped on the rare opportunity to test out police state behavior--going door-to-door, searching the homes of private citizens, just because a teenager from Chechnya was on the loose.

             Those two events you mention are perhaps the most obvious HOAXES of the Obama administration. You should really look at the massive, overwhelming amount of evidence for this before asserting that they are bona fide. One of the biggest mistakes you can make about these things is assuming you know how TPTB would operate. No, you must look at the evidence and make your judgment based on that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about what you're saying: you're saying it is easier to control an outcome by vaguely influencing an atmosphere until eventually (after two years or ninety-two years, however long it takes) hopefully some lone gunman or confused teenager goes on an attack that plays into your favor. This is ridiculous. It's obviously easier to fake it and pretend it's real so you (they) can control every facet of the event including the how, when, and who. False flag attacks have been a real thing since the Roman Empire and probably before then too.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've already commented in extensive detail many times about both of these events but I can definitely prove to you they are both staged frauds if you want to. It's 5 AM here right now so you'll have to respond later and I would be happy to. In the meantime there is a mountain of evidence for both being hoaxes that you can easily find. There's an over-400 page long book that's free to read online for example called No One Died At Sandy Hook. If you don't want to read 400 pages right now here's the article to start with.

              Thanks for the detailed reply, which I am just reading now. I'll read into the source that you have provided. Naive as it may sound, I really REALLY want to believe that Sandy Hook was legitimate. It happened 20 minutes from my house. I have also not been particularly sympathetic to the firearm rights community. I understand the value of militias, and I also hold pacifism to be at the center of my moral barometer and environmentalism to the cause which consumes the most of my energies (no pun intended).
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll comment again after a bit more research. I'm no stranger to false flags--I have a strong personal interest in the burning of the Reichstag and how similar events are used to manipulate the public.

              <p>
               You should research Project Longevity too, I think it began in Connecticut but it's basically the process by which they are using these hoaxes to overturn the 2nd Amendment. I don't know too much about it to be honest.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do know lots of facts and have lots of tidbits and videos and stuff about Sandy Hook if you want more though. Just let me know. There's been a ton of research and presentations done about it and I am very into conspiratorial stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
               I had never been a huge 2nd Amendment person but after getting wise to all of these false flag operations I am now. Bought a gun a few months ago even. An armed citizenry is the only thing keeping the government from rounding us all up into FEMA camps if they wanted to, as dramatic as that sounds.

            "Former CIA Officer" indeed. Like that's a thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of this information is public knowledge that is widely believed and has been for a long time. There is no news here just people claiming it.

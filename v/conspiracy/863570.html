             I believe so. Derren Brown gave his subject a lie detector which he passed when asked questions about his time while amnesic. I've also read elsewhere that passing lie detectors is a benefit of having a hypnotically created split personality.

            MAybe seeing a modern day hypnotist doing the same thing would change your mind. The Derren Brown video is quite good. Then you have Estabrooks saying he's essentially done the same thing. Estabrooks was a Harvard grad, Rhodes Scholar, and prof of psychiatry.

Check out Derren Brown pulling it off, as well.

            "I can hypnotize a man -- without his knowledge or consent -- into committing treason against the United States."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Is hypnosis dangerous? It can be. Under certain circumstances, it is dangerous in the extreme. It has even been known to lead to murder. Given the right combination of hypnotist and subject, hypnosis can be a lethal weapon."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The key to creating an effective spy or assassin rests in splitting a man’s personality, or creating multipersonality, with the aid of hypnotism.... This is not science fiction. ...I have done it."

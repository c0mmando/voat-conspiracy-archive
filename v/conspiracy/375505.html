           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In a recent article published by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., titled
             <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/vaccines-government-big-pharmas-dirty-money/">
              <em>
               Children at Risk – Vaccines, Government &amp; Big Pharma’s Dirty Money
              </em>
             </a>
             , he highlighted the fact that every vaccine introduced to the vaccine schedule guarantees its manufacturer millions of customers, increasing vaccine revenue by billions of dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, it appears that a minimum of 56 doses of 14 vaccinations before the age of eighteen is not quite lucrative enough for the pharmaceutical industry, as according to Mr. Kennedy’s research, the CDC has 271 new vaccinations under development in the hopes that vaccine revenues will reach a staggering $100 billion by 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kennedy called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “a cesspool of corruption, mismanagement and dysfunction,” making it crystal clear to readers that financial gain fueled their decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
             He wrote:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “Public health may not be the sole driver of CDC decisions to mandate new vaccines. Four scathing federal studies, including two by Congress, one by the U.S. Senate, and one by the HHS Inspector General, paint CDC as a cesspool of corruption, mismanagement and dysfunction with alarming conflicts of interest suborning its research, regulatory and policymaking functions. CDC rules allow vaccine industry profiteers like Dr. Offit to serve on advisory boards that add new vaccines to the schedule. In a typical example, Offit in 1999 sat on the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee and voted to add the rotavirus vaccine to CDC’s schedule, paving the way for him to make a fortune on his own rotavirus vaccine. Offit and his business partners sold the royalties to his rotavirus vaccine patent to Merck in 2006 for $182 million. Offit told Newsweek, “It was like winning the lottery!””
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As more and more states are choosing to mandate vaccinations, his words are very worrying, and what he says next does nothing to alleviate public concern:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “Normally plaintiffs’ tort lawyers would provide a powerful check and balance to keep vaccines safe and effective and regulators and policymakers honest. But Pharma’s dirty money has bought the industry immunity from lawsuits for vaccine injury no matter how dangerous the product. An obliging Congress disposed of the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, making it impossible for vaccine-injured plaintiffs to sue pharmaceutical companies for selling unsafe vaccines. That’s right! No class actions. No discovery. No depositions and little financial incentive for the industry to make vaccines safer.”
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In other words, by mandating vaccinations, the government has made it impossible for parents to protect their children from being injected with harmful chemicals.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Kennedy concluded by stating that:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “Ending exemptions is premature until we have a functioning regulatory agency and a transparent process. The best way to insure full vaccine coverage is for the vaccine program to win back public trust by ending its corrupt financial ties with a profit-making industry.”

             Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) Trials in Bangladesh
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In July 2015, a group of researchers and scientists, headed by Firdausi Qadri, Ph.D., published a study in The Lancet, titled
              <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2961140-0/abstract">
               <em>
                Feasibility and effectiveness of oral cholera vaccine in an urban endemic setting in Bangladesh: a cluster randomised open-label trial
               </em>
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Although the trial was deemed a success and reported favorably in several mainstream newspapers and scientific editorials, the results told a different story.
             </p>
             <p>
              The study examined three groups of participants:
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Non-vaccinated
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Vaccination only
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Those who received the vaccination and who were taught changes to their behavior, such as hand washing, with access to clean drinking water.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the vaccination-only group, there was a 37 percent improvement and in the vaccination plus behavioral changes group there was a 45 percent improvement.
             </p>
             <p>
              As you can see, the results of the study only indicated a low to moderate percentage of improvement and the fact that the authors stated that they recorded no vaccine-related serious adverse reactions leaves this study open to interpretation.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would have been interesting to have had a fourth group of participants. For example, those who had been educated in hygiene and had access to clean water but received no vaccination.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sadly, however, scientists missed this opportunity.

              According to many reports, the above results constituted a resounding success.

             “Firdausi Qadri, director of the vaccines centre at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease and Research, Bangladesh, who led the trial, says that the findings “show that a routine oral cholera vaccination programme in cholera-endemic countries could substantially reduce the burden of disease and greatly contribute to cholera control efforts.””

              As a consequence of such reports, the vaccine is being used throughout the developing world.

             “Using the cholera vaccine to stop outbreaks:
            </p>
            <p>
             “A global stockpile, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the ELMA Vaccines and Immunization Foundation, the EU Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO), the Margaret A Cargill Foundation and the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, initially made 2 million doses of the vaccine available. In 2015, with funding from the GAVI Alliance, the number of doses available for use in both endemic hotspots and emergency situations is expected to rise to around 3 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The oral cholera vaccine is an important tool in fighting cholera. Its use must be both supported by local authorities and used hand-in-hand with focused, sustainable water and sanitation actions in targeted communities.”
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Once again, on closer inspection, the study was found to be funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who appear to have a monopoly on vaccinations used in developing countries.

             Conclusion
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              How many vaccinations will be considered to be a sensible number? If all of the vaccinations currently under development are deemed a success, how many of them will be added to the schedule?
             </p>
             <p>
              As there is little research to determine which ingredients are in the vaccinations listed as “under development” by the CDC, many parents are concerned about their toxicity and how best to protect their children.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will leave you with the wise words of Robert F, Kennedy Jr: “Vaccine industry money has neutralized virtually all of the checks and balances that once stood between a rapacious pharmaceutical industry and our children.”

            Like shit. And when you tell your family that they are the biggest criminal organization in the world and that they are notorious drug dealers they tell you that you need to get on meds. Fucking idiots. LOL, the CIA doing good and loving the US, the biggest joke I have ever heard. The CIA would sooner work with the KGB (back in the day) before working for their own country. They care about themselves and themselves only. And they are involved in human and child trafficking and have done human experimentation throughout their history.

             Yep, now when I "smell" them IRL I try to kill them, be it in my truck or with my knife. w/e scum of the Earth, they knew what they were getting into. My hope is that Mattis performs a coup and we take the nation back.

            You kid, but then you don't realize that every advanced electronic device in your home has a microphone connected to the network. You are being watched, they are collecting data on you, and they are using that data to create the most effective approach to manipulating
            <em>
             you
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything you buy, everything you watch on TV, everything you say in private, everything is being gathered to create a profile on you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Advertisers, who don't even have half the data collection techniques as the three letter agencies, are able to suggest to you products you will need before you even think of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you being manipulated? If you tell me "no", does that make it true?
           </p>
           <p>
            They don't even need to have people following you, you carry a tracking device everywhere you go.

            There will be no civil war, but if there is, it will be by their design. Maybe to weed out all those who cannot be controlled or who will not conform, who knows.

            Care to post the equipment specs and raw data from whatever equipment you verified that they were clicking at you with? What is your methodology? Did people come into your place and comment on the clicking without prompting or was it something that you asked them to listen for?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or maybe see if your ceiling fan is off balance and is running at too high of a speed, causing the clicking?

              Or maybe you need to see about getting your haliperodal, clozapine and tiapride dosages re-adjusted? Maybe see about getting some Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in addition?

               I'm a bit lazy about it all, and any data or video would just be hounded with "fake" and so on. I think the best option is to kill every cia and nsa employee, traitors to the union, all. Unfortunately, I do not wield such power, so, I will piss and moan about it on the internet like a fool, or maybe end up like this guy NYC. What? Did you not hear about the NYC terrorist attack that's being covered up? They get into trucks now and mush people... pretty sick. :(

                Bitching like a little kid about it makes you look like a fucking tin foil hat wearing insane man with no pants who yells the end is near on the streets. Post relevant data and your method of obtaining it and man the fuck up. We will have an open mind but if you cant even be man enough to do this anonymously on the internet then they truly did win and you are the one allowing it to happen. If you have something to say say it dont be a little bitch. We WANT to see it, who knows maybe others have similar data, the world will only know if you speak up idiot.

"Man the fuck up"... ever put a knife to a man's throat? Ever had men tremble before you? Heh, it's all good. they didn't know who they were fucking with, no research, like the chemical and electronic abilities. You'd think, but, nope. It's not like the movies, a lot of them are bots. That's why we're in this situation we're in now, that's why the police didn't come to my door after today's event.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here are some names for you:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anita Walker, LPC - Edmond, Oklahoma - CIA sub-contractor who is there to destroy minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Carl and Debie Franklin - Air Force Intelligence - Edmond, Oklahoma - rent to innocent civilians for CIA experiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jon Burley and Nanci Morris New Jersey - A mix of ex-CIA sub contractors.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They are experimenting on people in Edmond,  Oklahoma. Throw away people, that's how they see them. It's happening, now, like right now, this hour. Nothing we can do, until enough of us get together with Molotovs, knives and guns, and do what needs to be done.

                  I am very much aware mind control is going on daily.  Is whoever is reading this right now honestly stupid enough to think it stopped?  Or that it hasnt grown even more intense to a point where you honestly would not believe me or this dude about the true nature of your reality?  Looking in to those names, so far I have no reason not to see the obvious
                  <em>
                   possibility
                  </em>
                  of a connections these people have to what you are saying from my few minutes of research and I will look more when I have the chance to.  I am curious what you have to say feel free to private message me if you wish to but I am going to sleep right now as I have to get up in a few hours.  For anyone reading this strange conversation, go do your fucking homework, start by looking into MK Ultra, project monarch, montauk project, and click on literally any link that looks interesting and use those as a diving board to jump off of and into the weirdness of the world around you and make your own conclusions about what might be going on here.  You are being manipulated on a minute by minute basis similar to what this guy is saying, doesnt mean he has any weight to his story but means he isnt running naked in the streets shitting himself either.  Yes I have had a knife to my throat I feel like that is pretty common though not really special unless you have a story you wish to tell us about it. Would love the data you have even if to satisfy my curiosity.  yes Oklahoma is purposely created as a throw away group of people as you say.   Yes action needs to be taken although you know just as well as i do that they have their butts covered and that direct confrontation would not work.  We need numbers and the only way to grow numbers is to not come off as "I have a secret but i cant tell you" but rather to follow the "hey this is seth rich did you know he died at the hands of the DNC and here is why" route that is obviously working to an extent lately especially in communities such as this one.  Our numbers are growing, action will come soon, but dont go getting yourself killed please it would make me sad.  Be smart, be safe my friend.

                   That's a big wall of text there. They use magnetic waves, it's most likely the Earth's magnetosphere, or possibly satellites. I've already supplied the Russians with as much as I can, or have guessed, without payment, as a huge "FUCK YOU" to those who observe, though it seemed that the Russians already knew! Heh... as they gave me some details... and then would not sneak me out of the nation. :(
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They use the waves to cause objects to "tap" (or as I say, click-clack) against surfaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   1 for no / bad
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   2 for yes / good

                   It's a type of programming. It's sick, and probably being used on more people than little ol' me.

                   I cannot escape the USA. They will not let me leave, this means that the end to my tale is pretty clear, unfortunately. You are an intelligent man, you can guess what happens next. It's been almost two years, with all-encompassing harassment. Why would I let it continue? Why would I leave without vengeance?

<p>I take this passage from an <a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/2013/12/21/the-council-on-foreign-relations-cfr-and-the-new-world-order/">anti-globalist article</a> on the Council for Foreign Relations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All that is needed to effectively control a government is to have control over the nation’s money: a central bank with a monopoly over the supply of money and credit. This had been done in Western Europe, with the creation of privately owned central banks such as the Bank of England.</p>
<p>Georgetown professor Dr. Carroll Quigley (Bill Clinton’s mentor while at Georgetown) wrote about the goals of the investment bankers who control central banks: <em>“… nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole… controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U.S. actually had a central bank before Andrew Jackson dissolved it, but then the Panic of 1907 gave early 20th Century globalists an excuse to create Ver 2.0 just six years later after wealthy bankers got Woodrow Wilson elected by pouring money into Teddy Roosevelt\'s 3rd Party campaign. This was a strategy that will throw off today\'s alt-right researchers looking for suspicious reasons why a major bank would support a Democrat, i.e. &quot;Oh look, banks supported a former Republican turned awesome renegade who I support!&quot; when in fact they knew he wouldn\'t win, just dilute the vote. They wanted Wilson, who promised to sign the Fed legislation.</p>
<p>Why should we think that the Fed is doing anything to preserve American capitalism?</p>
<p>In fact, it does not. It protects the interests of the super wealthy, because that\'s exactly who its shareholders are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Kershaw, in “Economic Solutions” lists the ten major shareholders of the Federal Reserve Bank System as: Rothschild: London and Berlin; Lazard Bros: Paris; Israel Seiff: Italy; Kuhn- Loeb Company: Germany; Warburg: Hamburg and Amsterdam; Lehman Bros: New York; Goldman and Sachs: New York; Rockefeller: New York. (That most, if not all of these families just happen to be Jewish, you may judge the significance of yourself). The balance of stock is owned by major commercial member banks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when you\'d think that everyone would be hurt by poor Fed policies, nope:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 1923 and 1929 the Federal Reserve expanded the money supply by sixty-two percent. When the stock market crashed, many small investors were ruined, but not “insiders.” In March of 1929 Paul Warburg issued a tip the Crash was coming, and the largest investors got out of the market, according to Allen and Abraham in “None Dare Call it Conspiracy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there were the bailouts in 2008-2012, which goes against financial natural selection as much as anything we\'ve ever seen. The Fed bought $700b in toxic mortgage backed securities, an unnecessary action done out of guilt and stupidity, because the Federal Reserve ignored the importance of the Community Reinvestment Act, did a piss poor job of calculating what was and was not &quot;subprime,&quot; and never raised interest rates after the dotcom correction. </p>
<p>For anyone dwelling on conspiracies, don\'t forget the Federal Reserve.</p>',

            Good, humanity needs to learn the hard truth, that even a small limited form of government is evil and will eventually turn against the people. Statism is incompatible with humanity, there are alternatives.

             It's amazing to me how "free thinkers" so readily give up religion (as an institution, not necessarily God) but they refuse to even consider that people can live peacefully without belief/faith/trust in the institution of the State.
            </p>
            <p>
             Institutions that are given authority will eventually become corrupt. Before Christianity moved into northern Europe, the Germanic people ruled through democracy in small tribes and when a leader was elected, he was expected to give up his power and the tribe was to go back to living WITHOUT an authority.
            </p>
            <p>
             People can live without government. Now that our communication is so connected with the internet, I don't see a reason to not give it a shot.

              Plenty of efficable bartering systems could be established as well. In fact, even a national identity as a people doesn't require a strong central government, but you do run into the conquering empire problem. There will always remain a force willing to have a strong central government that seeks to dominate weaker countries...

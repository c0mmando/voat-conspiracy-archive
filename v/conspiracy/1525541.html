<p>I run linux on my main computer, so it can be tough to find compatible games that I haven\'t already played. Let alone if you don\'t want to pay for them. On steam, there are about 10 free games supported by linux. Kind of lame, but if I could have played Ragnarok Online I may never have found Off Peak, and this creepy little gem may have gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>Off peak is a native linux game that, in my opinion, attempts to capture a similar feel to Bioshock (it does not completely fail in this attempt). I was surprised to find that the full run-time to completely play through the game was listed as around 30-35 minutes. As soon as I started that trailer I knew this game was gonna be weird, and was looking forward to going through and looking at all the artwork, finding symbolism, and hunting easter eggs. Then about halfway through the trailed the pedo spiral appeared. I immediately downloaded the game, and tried my best to document it with screenshots so that I could post my findings here.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/LJfaLz">Pedo spiral symbol</a> (elephant) This is what led me to look for all of the other things I found that could relate this to pizzagate.</p>
<p>You start off outside a train station, where a man a large head and a little body tells you he knows you are trying to go home, and that you don\'t have the money for a ticket. He says he has ripped a paid departure ticket up and left the pieces all around the train station and if you find the pieces, you can have the ticket. The train station is not connected to a city, and upon exploring it doesn\'t appear to be connected to anything at all. (I hadn\'t noticed yet, but you are most-likely playing as a child. if you hold the reticle straight forward and approach a person, you can see that you are only around waist level with them.)</p>
<p>You move closer to the train station and find <a href="https://sli.mg/Cf8TtD">this odd-looking person</a> with a small head and a large body who if you look closely, <a href="https://sli.mg/uRB4f6">is holding a skull behind her back</a>. She is around some other people, including one of <a href="https://sli.mg/6wt9U4">these guys</a> who are later identify as \'marcus\'s guards\' (<a href="https://sli.mg/3JOnGI">marcus</a> apparently owns the train station)</p>
<p>As soon as you walk into the train station, <a href="https://sli.mg/z9s979">this is what you see</a>. So much art, including <a href="https://sli.mg/MbSfNv">Rorschach Whale</a>,  a <a href="https://sli.mg/TXhKdd">Giant Pianist</a> and of course <a href="https://sli.mg/wZSAOr">more pedo symbols</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/yOXpgq">Moloch Skulls, Owls, Triangular Mobius Strip Giant Mural</a> </p>
<p>There was so much in <a href="https://sli.mg/KWMkPz">this mural</a> that I took multiple screenshots and spent at least 10 minutes looking at it in game. <a href="https://sli.mg/dLCTm2">Right side of mural</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/1VE5eW">Left side of mural</a></p>
<p>Notice on the left side of the mural, Mario is depicted in a devil costume driving a panel van, and Mickey mouse has a spiral for an eye. This mural is what convinced me there was something going on in this game.</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/Bj0nEQ">Interactions with characters are creepy and suggestive</a>, the soundtrack itself does a good job of being creepy.</p>
<p>On your journey to find the ticket pieces, you climb a very large flight of steps, there are 13 floors and each has a picture that could be taken as a symbol. <a href="https://sli.mg/fkODd2">Floor 1</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/C59fJA">Floor 2</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/POcHZ3">Floor 3</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/edGhqZ">Floor 4</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/bhjNEI">Floor 5</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/lYc3WE">Floor 6</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/pPeQ3Z">Floor 7</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/WM5t1e">Floor 8</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/iphv7t">Floor 9 (obvious one)</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/kUzovE">Floor 10</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/BXHr4k">Floor 11</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/hENOYv">Floor 12</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/8iMOGp">Floor 13</a> on one of the floors, <a href="https://sli.mg/uoHLfP">two people kissing</a>, <a href="https://sli.mg/11Od6h">one holds a skull behind the other\'s back</a>.</p>
<p>intense music plays and builds as you ascend the staircase (primitive drums and deep strings)</p>
<p>After the 13th floor the music stops, and you end up on the balcony where you can look into the main train station room. You also notice a Creepy Old Woman looking into the train station window. <a href="https://sli.mg/AfncsC">creepy old woman dialogue 1</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/ZA3MOn">creepy old woman dialogue 2</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/rMoW2B">creepy old woman dialogue 3</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/UHVIpL">creepy old woman dialogue 4</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/hyOKxk">creepy old woman dialogue 5</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/IAwO3A">creepy old woman dialogue 6</a></p>
<p>Upon returning to the staircase, you are met with <a href="https://sli.mg/0MpYjB">this craziness</a>, and the music comes back full force as this woman <a href="https://sli.mg/I7iocI">hands you a glowing bull skull</a>. This causes you to \'white out\' and you wake up to <a href="https://sli.mg/oGaKEc">this</a>. There is a very unnerving choppy/reversed music loop playing. When you walk out from behind the serpent statue, the music is normal again and you find yourself in the middle of the main train station room again.</p>
<p>And yes, there\'s <a href="https://sli.mg/LeAJUL">Pizza</a>. And a <a href="https://sli.mg/dihLyY">creepy pizza vendor</a>. <a href="https://sli.mg/osvrTu">pizza oven</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/FPKCln">pizza parties</a> <a href="https://sli.mg/96vHfP">for the right price</a></p>
<p>And the \'boss\' of this train station <a href="https://sli.mg/JaXXgT">sits behind some palm plants surrounded by cows</a></p>
<p>There is SO MUCH creepy suggestive shit in this game, I encourage you to go to my Off Peak SLiMG album to see all of the screenshots. I also encourage you to download this game and play it for yourself, as I can\'t possibly convey to you how on-the-nose it was with a text post and screenshots.</p>
<p>Happy investigating,</p>

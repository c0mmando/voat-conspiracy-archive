            I just wanted to point out there's a lot of questionable items, and its ALL been whitewashed out of the trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            The particular points in this article are pretty minor when you compare it to the evidence we have of Crisis actors, Craft on the scene, Fake injurys, the loudspeaker Drill announcements, REAL emergency personel who were turned away,  -So guys like Carlos Arrendondo (FBI patsy guy who pushed the wheelchair, of the conscious, double femoral injury actor), could play their part.

            Let's not forget too that the 'officials' not in the special FBI unit who ran into the brothers that night are dead. -The BPD (aneurysm), the 2 FBI Partners (Simultaneous death in 'helicopter training'- the three people likely to be called for testimony who probably would have related the brothers pleas: "We're being set-up".

            Curious how his brother dies in FBI custody, beaten to death. Also, his best friend was shot in the neck in his home by the FBI, after he had agreed to questioning.

            Okay, I'm going to read the whole article... but really? They're going to start off an article about the Boston Marathon
            <em>
             bombing
            </em>
            with that...? C'mon guys... okay back to reading..
           </p>
           <p>
            e: Well it was certainly an interesting read. As a vet who questions everything around me, I don't know. This still seems pretty flimsy. The pic with the cat, he had a 5 o'clock shadow, at best. Literally a days worth of growth, for a beard. In his post-mortem pic it is more pronounced, but it is also covered in blood. Any liquid makes a beard more pronounced, especially blood, which when coagulated will darken and thicken any surface it is on, and something like a beard (even a 5 o'clock shadow) would definitely be more pronounced from this, so IMO, it's hard to tell if there is anything of significance between those pictures.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to him being shot and ran over "while in custody;" civilians will often use or understand words differently than those that use those words day to day; "in custody" simply means at one time he was handcuffed, and put at a disadvantage, which can be anything from in a locked patrol vehicle (I don't think he was) on his knees (not likely) or lying face down on the ground with officer(s) over-watching him (I believe this was the case.) If the latter was the case, someone in this specific situation could easily jump/roll to his feet while the officer were distracted with Dzhokhar stealing/driving the vehicle, at which point they would have opened fire on him, shortly after he was ran over by his brother, initially attempting a pick up, but obviously it was a hectic situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm as skeptical as the next guy, but being skeptical about the skeptic's explanation also applies. I'm not saying they did or didn't do it, but there is a lot of "filling in the blanks" here, or looking for reasons why they are innocent. The beard thing is definitely reaching, and the "shot/ran over in
            <em>
             CUSTODY
            </em>
            " being misunderstood/blown out of proportion is just looking for flaws in the situation/story that probably aren't there...

             The argument the director made in the videos was very poor also. He kept assuming things about what happened as if something like that happened everyday. For example: he said that medics would
             <em>
              never
             </em>
             move an amputee after blowing off a limb, but he doesn't take into account that a bomb had just gone off, and it would have been more reasonable to move the person from the blast site... He never made any specific, objectively verifiable examples, so I see  no reason to take the argument seriously until more evidence is available.

This maxim has been taken a bit too literally (even by McLuhan himself) as people tried to distinguish &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; media. The media were defined by technology. Television was a medium. Print was a medium. Radio was a medium. Fine, that\'s what people mean by <em>media</em> -- it\'s the <em>means</em> by which information moves. If you consider something like the OSI Layers of computer networking, it can be pretty dicey to define a layer of media precisely. McLuhan doesn\'t really account for things like ticker scrolls of print headlines crawling along the bottom of Faux Noose, etc. Is that print or TV? I\'d suggest that these are elements of a wider genre. Genres exist within media and, perhaps, the genre is the message.</p>
<p>In this model, the internet is a medium. Fine. But not all the internet is created equal. Comments at CNN are moderated differently than comments at Fox. Comments can be groomed and cultivated for different agendas, but this genre of website has an authoritarian, top-down feel that runs counter to what was supposed to be &quot;fun&quot; about the internet in the Usenet days. People had heard that the internet was a wild west of exciting new ideas and communities. When news entities known from other media began to manipulate the audience commentary, that rumor felt untrue.</p>
<p>Enter the news aggregator. News aggregators established a new genre under different authority? leadership? corporate entity? I suppose its useful to try to define the genre (but I suspect others have done it better -- I\'d be interested). The site has a front page, which can be modified. The front page contains threads, which are curated into communities (subreddits, subverses, etc.) These threads contain a title (which is frequently a link), a score, and comments. The mode of interaction is generally to find existing articles, introduce the material with an informative or amusing headline, possibly debate the topic in the comments, and get a score.</p>
<p>It\'s worth asking what doesn\'t happen. Although duplicate content in links is frowned upon and links to new pictures are often extolled as OC, news aggregators are not particularly welcoming of new content. And, despite the use of &quot;FTFY&quot;, there\'s not much collaboration in the commentary. It\'s not a wiki (another genre), which emphasizes building a consensus. There\'s always some element of confrontation in comments. But we came here for the comments, right? We came here to say what we want, right? Sure and comments can win points, but I think something else is going on.</p>
<p>I think this medium/genre builds upon an existing dissatisfaction with obvious manipulation of userbases. We\'ve all seen astroturfing and excessive moderation. We support free speech and &quot;having our say&quot; -- but we don\'t write the articles to which we link. We are, oddly, using our humor and debate skills to promote other people\'s ideas. We\'re competing to be what we accuse other people of being in heated debates: shills.</p>
<p>I think this problem might be endemic to the &quot;medium&quot;. VOAT might reflect us more than Reddit did, but wouldn\'t that mean we\'re... choosing an echo chamber? I\'m not sure VOAT <em>can</em> be different than Reddit (or Fark, or Dig, or...). It might have a different flavor, but I think it might be the same game...</p>',

             McLuhan? It's a shitty book. I lost any credence when he got to hot/cold media. The popularity of the maxim has stuck with me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider, though, that you are doing what I had suggested we ought not to do: you've accepted McLuhan as an authority because of his preexistence in the medium. To me, it's less important if someone agrees or disagrees with McLuhan than what they chose to do with that point of departure.

               There's more than one reading of a text. I'm not so radical to say that they're
               <em>
                all equally valid

                am i right that you're younger than say 30?

                the medium is the message maxim is actually harder to understand in the current environment if you grew up in a world where the internet and similar networked technology existed.
               </p>
               <p>
                what he's really driving at is that the manner through which you choose to convey your message reveals some critical aspects of what it is that you wish to express.  the insight is that this typically reveals as much or more than the
                <em>
                 content
                </em>
                of the message.
               </p>
               <p>
                so, for example, you have an idea you want to share with people.  how do you deliver that?  you can walk up to them in person, or in a crowd and speak it aloud. You can write it down with a pen and paper, or you can print it like a newspaper and distribute it.  You can record it an play it over the radio, or you can film it and show it to people.   McLuhan is observing that this choice suggests quite a bit about what you are seeking to communicate.  By considering why each of these approaches might be best for your hypothetical message, and why they may not be, you can actually identify many things about what your message is intended to mean.
               </p>
               <p>
                adapted for the internet age, consider something like a buzzfeed listical.  why did they choose to display this information (the message) in this format?  THAT choice is actually as important as the content according to McLuhan.  I suspect he's right - the listical format is actually more important than most listicals.  it also immediately conveys a number of things about the content, foremost that it is of a trivial, shallow, and transient nature.  If it was a thoughtful, thorough, and ageless message it would likely be presented in book format.

                Consider Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the 21st Century" now.  Of course it's a book. Would it be change by being a blog?  A listicle? A podcast?  A youtube video? A hollywood film?  Of course it would.

                Boiled down, he's really hitting at a very base and subconscious way in which information is interpreted in a mass society.  His lessons are about manipulation of the public through media, and they've been absorbed entirely and adopted so completely that it's part of the architecture of our culture at this point.

                 A bit of a warning: it's somewhat late here, and I've been drinking.

                 I see what you're saying in paragraph 2. I seem to recall that McLuhan goes a bit beyond this, but... no Google preview available. I'm afraid I can't get too specific. Likewise, the semiotic criticisms are kind of resurfacing, but I don't have a firm handle on them.

                <p>
                 I think in the third paragraph, we might start to reconverge? I'm trying to deduce the "message" of a news aggregator. My suspicion is that the message is "people should shill for an authority". By paragraph 4, we seem to be back in alignment, but (forgive me if I'm butchering McLuhan again) just as it doesn't matter what is shown on television, the role of the news aggregator in establishing... the subservience(?) of the community is what is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not certain how much we disagree? Maybe I started of down a wrong path and came around? It's been since 20XX since I read McLuhan, and I only read that because of a lengthy graffiti fight in a stairwell.

                  i don't think a user-generated aggregation site has a singular medium.  if it were a cultivated site, like Digg became, that would be.  In this case, it's really the same as any other "social media."  People want to share.  In the case of a voat/reddit, they want to share with people they don't know.  They want to reach a wider audience than their locally available one.  This suggests people trying to connect and discuss things that are not massively popular.  The key is that the specific content will change constantly within that context.  There is nothing about say Voat that requires the submitted content to be intelligent, nerdy, computer-based, etc.  The medium has a bias toward niche interests and controversial topics, little else.  Submitting/discussing here suggests an interest in reaching either niche groups or the extraordinarily open-minded.  I think that's exactly what you'll find at voat if you look around.

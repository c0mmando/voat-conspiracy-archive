<p>Corporations have Gov officals in their pocket, this we all know. What if it starts at the food industry?</p>
<p>Think about it? What is something that will never stop selling? Food! It can\'t go out of style! What if we made food easier? Made it quicker? Tasty? Packed with sugar and salt? What if that sugar and salt was so cheap we could make things hundreds of times sweeter for nearly nothing? </p>
<p>You got me so far? Ok. So food is the selling point for alot of major industries. Cheap food makes you fat because of all the things inside it that are terrible, and proven to be terrible for you. If someone is fat they usually have more health problems, “Corpulence [obesity] is not only a disease itself, but the harbinger of others ”  Hippocrates, 460 - 370 BC. We have known this forever! So what do we do? We dont want to stop making money of cheap and easy to make food items, no way! We need to make this acceptable and in no way related! So we make pills to combat all the sicknesses that obesity causes, blood control, water control, pain control, even mental health issues like depression have been linked to <a href="http://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/links-between-obesity-and-mental-health/article/164957/">obesity</a>. So guess who cashes in on that? Thats right! The corporations, and in turn our elected officals. More bribes is a good thing, if you dont get caught that is!</p>
<p>Social Acceptance of obesity. This is something that, like everything else surrounds us as of late, utterly and completely surrounds us. What colors do you think of for happy and bright? Is is a stunning Yellow? Or a Glowing Red? because those are the same colors that fast food industries use for their logos, signs, uniforms (sometimes) and even yes! Their painting schemes! Its all constant propaganda to get you hungry and to get you to buy some food! Any food! Food right now! </p>
<p>So you start to see more fat people, and you start to see the media displaying fat people in sitcoms, movies, talkshows, everywhere! Even reality shows feature nothing but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_Comes_Honey_Boo_Boo">fat people!</a>. So they delete <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/FatPeopleHate">/r/FatPeopleHate</a> to stop the spewing of negativity that thousands of people laughed at. They eliminate it from being a discussion, they run ads showing &quot;Oversized&quot; (Which means fat) models who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk">&quot;Have Junk in all the right places&quot; </a>so you hear about how its ok!  They want you to get fat, so you can\'t be as judgey to others about being fat. You accept that you are fat, and they are fat so its ok! Nothing is wrong with being fat right? Cows are fat and what are cows? Oh yeah they are the money machines of farmers, the cash cow? Thats what we are to the government. </p>
<p>Still not convinced? I didn\'t believe this either until i saw just how little politicians and corporations care about the people, its nothing new, its something thats been around for thousands of years. We are the new experiement.</p>
<p>Stoping the spread of balanced diet. </p>
<p>Michelle Obama was doing great, getting kids off the couch, eating veggies and balanced meals, than it just really quietly switched to just exercise. Just real quick, ya know? Still mentioning eating balanced, but not talking about how you shouldnt drink soda. Which by the way take a <a href="https://katieannklein.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/cokecan-label1.jpg">look at how much a regular coke is worth in sugars.</a> Yeah 39 grams? So what! Well, here is what <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/sugarstacks/colas.jpg">39 grams looks like</a>. I bet you wouldn\'t enjoy eating all that sugar. Maybe you would? Who knows!</p>
<p>Ever noticed how much harder it is to Exercise in modern day America? I live near a big(ish) city and there are NO parks, i kid. There are about 10 football field sized parks stuffed to the brim with people basically bumping into each other. There\'s always walking around town! Well, if you dont mind the endless construction and non working street lights. State parks are good, but all the ones in my state just doubled in price. Huh, well if only there was a place to go just for exercise!</p>
<p>Gyms pop up, Have you noticed that? With this whole Exercise crazy Gyms would be stupid not to take advantage! They look like the good guy, but heres the thing. They know you aren\'t going to come after a while, you\'ll stop coming and hopefully keep paying. If you go to a gym, KEEP IT UP! You\'re doing great and i love you for it! If you dont you should, and you should make the gym earn the money you give it.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that the government has been more friendly looking, i mean not really, but from the view of the media. Legalized Gay Marriage (congratulations everyone!) to keep everyone happy! If we give them what they want they will remain complainant. Lets legalize pot! (which everyone wants) So they can remain lazy and compliant. 
They want us happy, &quot;Smart&quot; consumers, and i mean consumers. </p>
<p>Even the veggies are corrupted! </p>
<p>Ever heard of GMO\'s? Well you should, it basically turns corn into a fly/pest killing machine. Think of cross breeding a pesticide with a husk of corn and eating that. Does that sound good? I hope so, because they are <a href="http://www.offthegridnews.com/off-grid-foods/obama-signs-monsanto-protection-act-forces-gmos-on-your-family/">forcing farmers to plant the stuff. </a> So get ready for that next time you visit you\'re local wal-mart.</p>
<p>Im telling you i have been looking this stuff up for months now, it only adds up to one thing.</p>
<p>TL;DR We are cattle for the Government.</p>',

            Sell the high profit margin nutritional deficient and easily prepared food to the overworked and depressed citenzenship, make beneficial (dealing with life issues) drugs illegal (see the work of MAPS), make gluttony a socially acceptable way to cope with life, then make money off treating the fat related diseases.

            Your writing tone was hyped up right with the links. Reminded me of a soapbox screamer in the street. I don't think that's the problem with your piece though. The problem is not enough people will read and think about it. Many good points bender7, thanks. More people must be realizing what is going on around them than we think. There needs to be a way to get more people talking to each other and less people watching the news.

            Thanks! I've been fuming about this for months. I just wish there was more people who realized how scary this is.

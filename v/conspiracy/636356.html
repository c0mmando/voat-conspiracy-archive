<p>Here is the theory. Rubeo was raised by operatives of Castro to be an infiltration agent of the Cuban and Soviet governments.</p>
<p>Here is the info I found:</p>
<p>Rubio\'s parents were Cuban immigrants.</p>
<p>Rubio made public statements that his parents fled Cuba to escape Castro.
However, there were reports in papers in Oct 2011 that that was not correct. Rubeo\'s parents fled from Batista in 1956,</p>
<p>The United States attempted to assassinate Castro 8 times between 1959 until late 1964.</p>
<p>After fleeing Batista and after the glorious victory of the peoples communist revolution of Cuba, Rubeo\'s parents traveled back to Cuba at least four times including one visit which lasted for a month in 1961.</p>
<p>The parents were not citizens at the time of Rubeo\'s birth in 1971 but were naturalized in 1975.</p>
<p>It is not inconceivable that after having so many attempts on his life and a near invasion that Castro, with the help of his Soviet allies, could have made a long term intelligence decision to put an agent into the United States as a citizen ,using the anchor baby rule, for the purpose of infiltrating the United States government.</p>
<p>That would be a great intelligence asset. It would help to know if another invasion or assassination was coming and maybe a chance to hamstring an enemy occasionally. </p>
<p>Dozens of attempts could be made to offset the long shot nature of the project. The costs are virtually nil because you just set your agents lose to have a child and raise an agent they have to support themselves - so it\'s just personnel and that\'s cheap when you can\'t feed everyone.</p>
<p>I might go further and say that it might be likely that while Casto\'s anger at the United States would not hinder his acceptance to go along with the idea, the idea itself would be of purely of Soviet design.
What other meteoric rise of someone whose parents had communist ties rose to the office of President?</p>
<p>Rubio grew up normally enough. He graduated from high school in 1989. He went to college from 1989 at one school and 
transferred to another in 1990 and graduated in 1993 to earn a degree in political science.</p>
<p>Rubio had an early interest in politics and government.</p>
<p>Rubio went directly into law school and earned a J.D. degree in 1993. During this time he was an intern for a U.S Representative who coincidentally had fled Cuba when she was 7 years old.</p>
<p>Rubio then worked for Bob Doles campaign in 1996.</p>
<p>Rubio then served as a City Commissioner of West Miami until around 2000 when he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Rubio was in the Florida house from 1999 when he won a run-off in a special election by 64 votes.</p>
<p>Rubio became the Florida house speaker in 2002 by appointment of the majority leader.</p>
<p>Rubio announced he would run for U.S. Senate in 2009 and was elected in 2010.
In less than one full term as Senator, Rubeo nearly succeeded in passing &quot;comprehensive immigration reform&quot; along with what has become known as the &quot;gang of eight. The legislation was for open borders and full amnesty to who ever could make it into the country.</p>
<p>Rubio announced he would run for U.S. President in 2015.</p>
<p>So while there is no proof that this conspiracy theory is real there is nothing that would disprove it in his public record and some that commends it.</p>
<p>It should would explain his sweating and nervous drinking though. Trying to pull something like that off would have to be very stressful</p>
<p>Has anyone heard anything about this?</p>',

            Not unreasonable to discuss, but likely wrong.  Rubio's family didn't flee Cuba at all - they just moved.  He's of the class that was basically kicked out, and came up around the South Florida cuba-exiles that are the rest of the pre-Castro ruling class.  If he's a plant, he's reallly fucking good because everything he says is crazy and opposite the Castro revolution.

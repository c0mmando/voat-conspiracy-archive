<p>Instead, the minister said the money was from an unspecified &quot;investment&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It is (from) a private Saudi citizen, I believe, and the funds went to an investment in Malaysia,&quot; Al-Jubeir was quoted as saying in a report by The New York Times yesterday.</p>

            The nature of the MH370 disappearance would lead me to believe it was training for a more advanced 9/11 style hijacking whereby the plane becomes untraceable. The Saudis obviously gain by ruining relations between Russia, a rival oil trading nation, and Europe as the MH17 event did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would not be surprised if this was engineered by them. The Saudis basically have hundreds of millions of Muslims working for them now via Islamic State and its sympathizers. Malaysian Airlines staff are all probably Muslim.

            15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. I can only imagine that has something to do with it. Perhaps they intend to attack Europe this time? Seems that the Arabs intend to establish a caliphate and have found a welcome mat in Sweden.

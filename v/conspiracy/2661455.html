           You read a little about this guys life and you might come to the same conclusion as me. The Chinese government sent Wang to the U.S. and even handed him detailed jnstructions on how to make magnetic core memory functional. But everything that happened after that was a tar baby situation neither country could control. The Chinese were probably not aware of the value of his value as a legitimate genius and only wanted him as a spy.

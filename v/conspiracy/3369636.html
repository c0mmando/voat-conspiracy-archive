<p><strong>Connecting the dots in El-Paso. Shooter\'s father has ties to CIA mind control, sexual abuse ring, has a creepy YouTube channel. Let\'s get to the bottom of this.</strong></p>
<p>We are not being told the whole story. Something insane is going on here and I want to make sense of it. This is the most recent information I have access to and my current understanding of the situation:</p>
<p>The El-Paso shooter\'s father is named &quot;John Bryan Crusius&quot; aka &quot;Bryan Crusius.&quot;</p>
<p>He is a licensed therapist. <a href="http://www.dallasaddictionrecoverytherapy.com/bryan-crusius-lpc/">Here is his website</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/XeU6QPL">Family photo with shooter</a></p>

<p>He worked at the Timberlawn mental health facility in Dallas as Director of Dual Diagnosis.</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBFjXwTWkAc3494.jpg">source</a></p>
<p>He was a contributor to a Texas State sponsored &quot;Children\'s Interest Seminar&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/All_Archived_Documents/SupremeCourt/AdministrativeOrders/miscdocket/94/94-9070.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi9hpTYge3jAhVKIDQIHSPiBJs4HhAWMAV6BAgEEAE&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gImuxzZzSPoPl-ez1ZvmP">Link</a> (I have noticed he talks a lot about childhood trauma in his videos as well.

<p>He had a (now deleted) YouTube channel.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/TY3Ab">archive1</a> <a href="https://archive.is/Lk2qh">archive2</a></p>
<p>In one video, he admits that he is connected to &quot;Healers&quot; that were trained by John of God of Brazil. He rented them space and helped them move in apparently.</p>

<p>Let\'s follow the John of God of Brazil lead first.</p>
<p>John of God is a &quot;faith healer&quot; in rural Brazil. He basically runs a cult, and he is eating shit right now for widespread and long term sexual abuse of potentially hundreds of people. Here are the interesting links I have for him:</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey is largely responsible for making him famous in the first place, when she brought a film crew to Brazil. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgTb6v1MDRQ">Here\'s the video.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://m.imgur.com/I862aM2">pic</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtsNfy1eVMA">Here</a> is a 60 Minutes segment talking about his cult and the abuse allegations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/2179313/accusations-pile-against-jailed-faith-healer-john-god-brazil">Here is a relevant news article.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/latinamerica/top-stories/john-of-god-faith-healer-kept-teenagers-as-sex-slaves-and-sold-their-babies-for-up-to-%C2%A340000-before-shipping-them-from-brazil-to-europe/ar-BBT35BO">Another news article</a>... &quot;After the initial interview on TV authorities were reportedly contacted by more than 600 other accusers, including Faria\'s adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira.</p>
<p>His 49-year-old daughter told magazine Veja, that under the pretence of mystical treatments her \'monster\' father abused and raped her between the ages of 10 and 14.</p>
<p>She told the magazine that he stopped after she became pregnant by one of his employees.&quot;</p>
<p>John of God is also acquainted with Marina Abramovic. <a href="https://imgur.com/jqGZGkb">pic</a> Yes, the very same lady from the Spirit Cooking fiasco that got tied into Pizzagate, go figure. I think we should be checking the WikiLeaks dumps again for new info in light of this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8scHdmE7PYg">More John of God YouTube videos</a></p>
<p>One of the accusers committed suicide. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8346590/activist-probe-arrest-rapist-john-of-god-commits-suicide/">Article</a></p>
<p>John of God is also known to have had contact with Naomi Campbell, and the Clintons. More on this later.</p>
<p>Now, let\'s pick up the Timberlawn lead.</p>
<p>Remember, John Bryan Crusius worked at Timberlawn.</p>
<p>Timberlawn was shut down last year for &quot;saftey violations.&quot; <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2018/01/18/dmn-investigates-troubled-timberlawn-psychiatric-hospital-closing-before-state-can-shut">article</a></p>
<p>A former patient, Pat Price, is speaking out and trying to find other victims and witnesses. She is pretty gangster, given the powerful interests that would like to shut her mouth for her. SPREAD THIS:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.survivingtimberlawn.com/pats-story">https://www.survivingtimberlawn.com/pats-story</a></p>
<p>I would like to Introduce Colin A. Ross. An intelligence spook that worked at Timberlawn, and once gave an interesting lecture at UMass Amherst, it appears he is a key to understanding what happened there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/expert-discuss-cia-mind-control-experiments">Link</a></p>
<p>Quote: &quot;Colin A. Ross, an expert on dissociation and trauma-related disorders, will speak on “CIA Mind Control Experiments by American Psychiatrists: Creation of Multiple Personality Disorder in the Manchurian Candidate Programs” on Wednesday, May 2 at 4 p.m. in 227 Herter Hall.</p>
<p>Ross will describe CIA and military mind control experimentation by American psychologists and psychiatrists, including the use of hypnosis, LSD, sensory deprivation and isolation and brain electrode implants, and the creation of “‘Manchurian Candidate’ super spies.”</p>
<p>According to Ross, victims of the experiments included unwitting civilians, terminal cancer patients, imprisoned drug addicts, imprisoned sex offenders, psychiatric patients and military personnel. LSD experiments were conducted on children as young as 5 years old. Related biological and chemical warfare experiments were conducted on unwitting civilians including children, pregnant women and people in coma.</p>
<p>An internationally known clinician, researcher, author and lecturer, he is the founder and president of the Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma, which provides treatment for patients with dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related trauma disorders at Timberlawn Mental Health System of Dallas, Texas.&quot;</p>
<p><em>This Colin Ross guy worked at Timberlawn</em>. Notice he also talks about trauma just like Bryan Crusius.</p>
<p><a href="https://dailycollegian.com/2007/05/psychologist-discusses-covert-cia-mind-experiments/">More media coverage</a></p>
<p>Colin Ross has also faced some complaints.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/EvidenceAgainstDr.ColinA.RossVol.1/EvidenceAgainstDr.ColinRossVol.1_djvu.txt">Link1</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/memoryabuse/petition">Link2</a></p>
<p>Here is an interview with Jeff Rense. <a href="http://mediaarchives.gsradio.net/rense/special/rense_021413_hr2.mp3">Link</a></p>
<p>WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THIS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find the office space that Crusius rented to the &quot;healers.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find previous addresses and phone numbers that could link him to something juicy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find other victims from the Timberlawn facility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to find any interviews with Bryan Crusius. What does he have to say about his son\'s actions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find connections between Colin Ross and anyone else involved in the greater PedoGate investigation.</p>

           I would like to Introduce Colin A. Ross. An intelligence spook that worked at Timberlawn, and once gave an interesting lecture at UMass Amherst, it appears he is a key to understanding what happened there.

           Quote: "Colin A. Ross, an expert on dissociation and trauma-related disorders, will speak on “CIA Mind Control Experiments by American Psychiatrists: Creation of Multiple Personality Disorder in the Manchurian Candidate Programs” on Wednesday, May 2 at 4 p.m. in 227 Herter Hall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ross will describe CIA and military mind control experimentation by American psychologists and psychiatrists, including the use of hypnosis, LSD, sensory deprivation and isolation and brain electrode implants, and the creation of “‘Manchurian Candidate’ super spies.”
          </p>
          <p>
           According to Ross, victims of the experiments included unwitting civilians, terminal cancer patients, imprisoned drug addicts, imprisoned sex offenders, psychiatric patients and military personnel. LSD experiments were conducted on children as young as 5 years old. Related biological and chemical warfare experiments were conducted on unwitting civilians including children, pregnant women and people in coma.
          </p>
          <p>
           An internationally known clinician, researcher, author and lecturer, he is the founder and president of the Colin A. Ross Institute for Psychological Trauma, which provides treatment for patients with dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder) and related trauma disorders at Timberlawn Mental Health System of Dallas, Texas."

           . Notice he also talks about trauma just like Bryan Crusius.

            Reddit admins are actively working to shape the narrative.  This was the second time I was "shadow banned" when commenting on reddit.  I was bribing up the issue of William Cooper and his predictions about school shootings to convince Americans to disarm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically, you're free to post almost anything you want, but if there's an event that is to be used to shape the narrative, any counter narrative is squelched.  Talk about the moon landings, flat earth, etc., but expect to have your voice censored when there's an important narrative being pushed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reddit is no longer reddit.  It's all controlled.

            The whole purpose of the shooting and many more to come Is to induce fear into the general public. They want you to know that the shootings could happen anywhere, anytime And there’s nothing you can do about it until we take your guns away.

            I saved this part for the comments because it is wild speculation. Everyone wants to craft a narrative that makes sense of the things they see in this world, and I am no different. The desire to understand is insatiable.

            First of all, the involvement of Colin Ross and his expertise on psychological manipulation raises the possibility that the shooter was programmed or guided to perform this violent act.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this shooter the product of a human farm? Was he a Manchurian killer?

            The big picture links here are Naomi Campbell and Marina Abramovic. They are both tied to John of God and Jeffrey Epstein. Naomi Campbell flew on the Lolita Express. Abramovic is connected to a bunch of scumbags including the Podestas and Clintons. This means we are looking at an extension of Pedogate. This is not a social circle that includes good people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Naomi Cambell really needs to be questioned.

            "In a video, Bittencourt, whose organization, Coame, helps women report sexual assault by religious leaders, said she has spoken to women from at least three continents who claimed they bought Brazilian babies from John of God for as much as $50,000, the Mirror reported."

            The formation of Greater Israel is the ultimate goal, with a border that stretches to the Euphrates river. With no superpower to keep them in check, they will annihilate their rivals once no one is looking. We already know they are willing to do shit like 9/11, so mass shootings seem tame in comparison.

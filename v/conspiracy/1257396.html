            Conspiracy Theory: Vietnam war was actually fought because Vietnam didn't want to be guinea pigs for Monsanto's soon to be released GMO rice.  So Monsanto created Agent Orange and got USA to bomb the hell out of them.  It was never about winning.  It was about revenge for not talking the GMO.  Monsanto destroyed their crops and their country.  Iran beware.

             It does not quite work like that. GMO crops take more energy input for yield gains at greater costs to the environment. Not to mention the capability for Western GMO companies/govt to manipulate them so as to create a food crisis in the first place with GMOs. Once there is natural resistance to first or 2nd generation GMO you are dependent on the petro-agro-chemical companies to make varieties with new modification to stay ahead of evolution. The competitive advantage of GMO disappears over several generations.

              This is where all that time in college pays off: No it doesn't. It's really just that simple. Stop making your fields 100% GMO and you'll never see resistance grow. As for the energy? They're literally the same crops. They just waste less of what you give them. No need to clear large fields when you can spend the same resources on a tinier one.

               My time in college studying this very thing has taught me GMO and genetic modified anything is a new field and has not had enough studies done to determine the overall effect.  In fact the random mutations that occur when doing this is enough to take a step back and say no.  Study it first before releasing a NEW (Yes this is NEW they don't know jack shit about DNA and GMO's right now) science into the wild.

               Dolly the sheep is DEAD.  That was not a success.  Introducing GMO's into the wild can have deadly effects.
              </p>
              <p>
               DNA wasn't discovered until 1935.  First GMO Patent - 1980.  FDA approves GMO: 1982.   Two years and they release that shit on the public.  This is a dangerous thing they are doing and they don't give a shit.

               You think it's to save the world.  BS.  It's to make these companies money and patent seeds which then can't be kept or re-used by farmers making them dependent on those who make and sell the seeds.  It also can infect other crops.

                I'm sorry to say (not really), but that's just not how that works. We've been a this for decades (Milleania, really). If your time in college "taught" you something so erroneous, then it really is just another nail in the coffin of the educational system.

                I'm seriously doubting whether you understand how genetics work. Answer me honestly here: How exactly do you think mutations work? Like, why do you think they happen, and what are their effects?

                Damn science was slow back then. Over one century later and we JUST then have a proper working application of genetics. Looked into it more after that first sentence and it turns out Congress had just allowed university labs to patent their research. First issue: The GMO in question was bacteria modified to eat oil. They had that thing on the shelf for 7 years by that point.

                The first food modified with modern techniques was the flavr savr tomato which was engineered to ripen more slowly, giving it a longer shelf-life. It was approved in 1994. Seriously, did you actually look any of this up?

This ruling legally permitted ownership rights over GMOs, giving large companies the incentive to rapidly develop GMO tools that could both be useful and profitable.

Bacteria had been genetically engineered to synthesize human insulin, allowing them to produce enough of the hormone to purify, package, and prescribe it to diabetes patients as the drug Humulin [11].

                  It is very clear. He discovers the molecule, isolates it, then names it. What was discovered later was its chemical structure. Chemistry is weird in that you find the new substance first, then you find out what it looks like deep down.  This is no different.

                  That's actually the same timeline I found. If it's not mistaken (And I did a bit of the Due Diligence for you), your "dangerous" GMO crops took almost a decade and a half to be developed, approved, then shipped  for consumption after Congress allowed patenting.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Then the quote is literally what I told you happened. Congress allows patents in 1980, Oil eating germ is patented, then two years later we make Insuline with them and save lives.

                  Again, I can help you understand. I know what it's like to be scared and ignorant. These things all sound so worrying when you hear so many terms, phrases, and figures you don't understand.

                    The question is vague. DNA itself? 100%. Its mechanics? Still Maybe 95%?  The exact role telomeres play in aging are still beyond us (Incidentally, the first clone probably died due to said telomeres).

                   <p>
                    Genes? I'd say a good ... 40% for humans? We're only just now beginning to really throw ourselves into genetic research with CRISPR and human embryonic testing. So we've only been able to study genes after they've already gone wrong out in the wild. That's just people, of course.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Plants are way easier since crops (The ones we're REALLY interested in) are effectively clones thanks to the way they reproduce. So research is pretty fast. It's a huge industry, the subjects are almost perfect, and there's not an incredible variety of them to study.

                    We still argue about the definition of  a "species" 150 years later. It's science, not church. I would hope they contest things. Corrections can only lead us to more knowledge. Also, it's just a rehash of what I was saying earlier in this post (whch, to be fair, you haven't seen yet). Humans just aren't fully understood yet. We share almost all of our genome in common, we have almost all the same non-coding sequences, the same retroviruses. When we finally get to use CRISPR and other such techniques, we'll realy make progress on human genetics.

                    But I don't need to tell you humans and corn are two different things. We share only some of our DNA, and they have WAY less variation since they reproduce asexually.

                        We're not Kirby. We don't just assimilate the things we eat into our genetic code. The danger is having food become toxic to humans. And that's not happening as long as the FDA is around because it's there specifically to make sure food isn't toxic to humans.

                        There are real concerns to be raised about the ethics of patenting living organisms, and whether genes themselves can be copyrighted, but turning that all into "GMO IS BAD PLZBAN" is not the answer. Our discoveries save lives, and they're held to incredibly high standards before being approved. Medicine in particular can take upwards of a decade to be approved (Yeah, you're taking pills invented in 2000.

                         No but crops do.  It's called breeding or pollination (where they pass their genetic information on to the next generation).  Unintended effects can happen.

                          Moving the goalposts here isn't helping. You specifically said introducing genes into the DNA of humans. Humans do not assimilate plant DNA. And you're thinking pollination. It's the closest plants have to sexual reproduction. The consequences are indeed unintended, but plants aren't going to eat people any time soon.

                           Pollination is when plants pass genetic information to the next generation.  When this happens and the plant happens to contain GMO genetics which BTW is most likey to contain genes/RNAto produce toxins to kill bugs it can lower the seeds effectiveness over time much like Dolly died of lung cancer after 6 years.  An unknown thing that no scientist predicted could happen.  Because they can't predict what will happen because they don't know enough about it to make any such predictions.  Anything they say at this point is speculation and bullshit.

                           I never said plants are going to EAT PEOPLE you moron fucking idiot.  GMO plants could very well spread to other plants and pass on genes to themselves and in years to come when we're all dependent on these GMO plants they can mutate and bam the world has a shortage of food because the GMO crops FAILED for some unknown reason.  Some RNA didn't copy correctly and created something wrong and there you go...world hunger.  And scientists will be scratching their heads and blame it all on climate change.

                           In essence the crops themselves could get lung cancer ( NOT LITERALLY YOU FOOL FUCKING GET YOUR HEAD OUT YOUR ASS) and die off quickly leaving the planet with no food.  And even worse they could have spread this genetic malfunction to good crops which could render them useless in years to come.

                            The message isn't wrong, but a few nitpicks: 1) That's cross-pollination. That's the closest plants have to sexual reproduction. 2) Of course modern crops are engineered to resist pests. That's the selli ng point. Don't point out the obvious. Especially to the guy who wanted to do this kind of stuff for a living. 3) It's just Genes. RNA is, to make a long story short, what your cells turn DNA into so they can actually carry out its instructions.

                            I've asked before and I'll ask again: Do you know how mutations work? Like, why they happen and what they do? I'm getting the impression you think there's some mothership out in orbit waiting for all the plants in the world to cross-pollinate with our food to send out some kind of mutagenic "Kill all the plants" signal or something.  That said there is actually one unexpected finding in all of this:
                            <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/selection_pressures_push/">
                             Turns out plants can only have a certain number of things being selected for at a time
                            </a>
                            before the population collapses. So there's that. Science marches on, but it turns out biology has a speed limit.

                            Have you considered the fact that we're in great danger of that happening now? I mean, your understanding of natural selection (which is very poor) aside, the obsoleted plants are all genetically identical. Clones. Sometimes literally.  All it takes is a disease that's able to kill just ONE for them to do serious harm to our food supply.

                              ELI5 Evolution (Since you don't understand): DNA makes copies of itself. But sometimes it makes mistakes. Most of these mistakes don't do anything. Some of them make the organism change for better, and sometimes worse. If it's better, they make more babies, if it's worse, they make fewer. But here's the thing: They only happen to individual organisms; not everyone gets the sae mistake at once.

                             <p>
                              If the mistake is going to make it anywhere, it needs to be either good, or not do anything worse than the others. So organisms with bad mistakes will just disappear on their own.

                               You're talking about normal DNA.  Not man-made DNA (and you know what I mean by that) which caused our first cloned sheep dolly to somehow get lung cancer.

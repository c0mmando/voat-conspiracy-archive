            Oh knock it off. I lived just down the road from that neighborhood for YEARS and was in community development there. It's a perfect storm of hipster artists, a city slacking in code violations enforcement, and very bad judgment. I worked for an Oakland CBD and did a few evaluations for the city in that same area. We walked a few city blocks rating the code violations based on illegal dumping, graffiti, dilapidated building structures, and infrastructure concerns like uneven side walks, etc. I'd have to look at my paperwork, but I bet you we evaluated that warehouse (or very close to it, it was for my masters thesis class). There is no crazy pedo ring happening by the elite rich in that area. Now there is definitely prostitution and some of those are often young teenagers, but the clients are your average smuck who sits behind their computer posting conspiracy theories and having to pay a few bucks to get laid.

            the vast majority of locks used on houses are of a shitty design. look at the ones they use in japan. the ones in the US can often be defeated by a bump key. get a key ring loaded with different sized bump keys and you can probably pick 90% of the locks you come across with that and a hammer in less than 10 seconds per lock.

            Are you crazy?
The bic pen is kinda acceptable, yes, it hurts, but it doesn't roll, which offsets that. Yes, they could do a curved part to hold it and keep the rest square, but that would cost more and the whole idea behinf that pen is that it costs pennies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The megadrive controller sucked ass, the SNES controller was much better (really, 3 horizontal buttons, no shoulders, the curved ass ending). As for the N64 controller, yes, it's ugly as fuck, but it was not unconfortable by any means. It's completely a product of the era, the developers never thought of the possibility of using the d-pad and the analog stick at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you really think the original ps1 controller was "perfect" since the beginning, you have probably never played videogames before. No analogs, the d-pad sucked (it chafed the thumb like crazy with that under-plastic design), they added the analog sticks we know and love after the N64 came up with the idea. The original xbox controller was a hugh monstrosity, on par with the dreamcast one.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the car seats, I have no idea, I've only owned one car and it had headrest in both the front and back rows.

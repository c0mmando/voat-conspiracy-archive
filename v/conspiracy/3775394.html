            Your use of the word normal is vague and confusing, especially in conjunction with the word average.

            Occam's razor does not account for willful malice or deceit. Save it for natural phenomena.

              Yes it can, and is. Normal and average are synonymous, therefore using them to describe separate groups is poor writing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think I understand you; 'normal' means unbrainwashed or aware of the need for being in a natural state,right?

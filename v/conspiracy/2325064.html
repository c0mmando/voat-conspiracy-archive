              1. Trump's Twitter Usage (if it were Obama it would be 'transparency' and community); 2. Trump dealing with Syria or North Korea or Russia--damed if he does damed if he doesn't. If he is good to Russia (Korea), he's a Russophile "In bed with the Kremlin", but if he opposes Russia, he's starting a new cold War or a Hawk, Neocon, Belligerent, or simply "the optics of distancing himself from Russiagate". Same with Syria--he's a warmonger if he fights ISIS, but if he wins against ISIS, we won't say a word. Not a WORD.

              ~~N/A because Trump hasn't fucked up yet.  LOL  Something is bound to happen that is bad and they will blame him.~~ They blame Trump for Congress' failures to pass Health Care Bills.  Mostly, everything they blame Trump for is actually other parts of government failing (DOJ, FBI, Congress...State Dept...etc)  BOMB Clyclone: Yep that was TRUMP's Fault.  This cold weather is all Trump's fault.  I guess I could see them Heaping blame over the UN decision and Cutting funding to NATO--they are preemptively shaming him over that "I can't believe this is happening...I can't believe this person is our president"...[[[more to come]]]

              Every Single Day These people Have Self-Congratulatory Stories and Award Ceremonies that Aggrandize themselves, mostly patting each other on the backs for Ridiculing Trump...because that's the brave and 'edgy' thing to do.

They didnt ignore this kid, they used him as a patsy in a PLOT. They probably manipulated him into thinking he actually did the shooting.   I think the reason that everything failed so badly to prevent this event; local police ignoring 3 dozen warnings, FBI &quot;misfiling&quot; a report, police on scene being cowards, etc;  was because it was SUPPOSED TO FAIL.   
</p>
<p>To me this whole thing looked extremely fishy from the get go.  Now with all these failures of the government both federal and local, the gun grabbers can say, &quot;Look everything we have in place failed, the laws are not strong enough, the police are not trained/militarized enough, the FBI even failed so we need to take away all guns because muh children are dying.&quot;</p>
<p>Then today I saw a video posted on here where a teacher that saw the actual shooter described him as &quot;being covered head to toe in tactical gear with a kind of rifle I had never seen before.&quot;  LINK:

<p>The article in the link also talks about the implausibility of donning and disrobing tactical gear in the extremely brief timeline given by official gov sources.  
</p>
<p>In addition, the fact that as many as 4 cops stood around while CHILDREN were being slaughtered only makes sense to me if A) they are cowards  OR  B) they were told not to enter the building and engage the gov hit man inside.   I think both are possible but B is my choice. </p>
<p>Another note, no Black kids and only one Hispanic kid were killed.  The only non-white victims were one Asian and one kid that is maybe Hispanic or something similar, maybe Pacific Islander.  To me this indicates a highly trained individual carefully choosing targets, not shooting at random.  Maybe this school is mostly white and there just were not may minorities to shoot.  But I postulate this was done to inflict maximum emotional damage against the white majority who are gun owners. They want to hit the people in the emotions as hard as possible.</p>
<p>Dont even get me started on this highly coached &quot;teen activists&quot; who just seemingly sprang from nowhere with a fully formed ideology and funding and handlers and everything you would expect from a well funded Deepstate plot. </p>
<p>I could include tons more evidence but dont really wanna spend an hour on one post.  I just wanted to put this thought forward and see what evidence or responses you guys could add.</p>',

            FRom what I've read that Benjamin Fulford has put out was that this was a counter-deep-state OP and it was to send the pseudo-jewish cabal a message. The school is a jewish school and mostly filled with jewish kids. All the kids killed were/are associated with local cabal jews or something along those lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or maybe it was a counter-ploy, as in still not "real" but used their dirty tricks against them?
           </p>
           <p>
            All I know for sure is that this whole thing fucking smells.

            I suddenly saw the shooter about twenty feet in front of me standing at the end of the hallway actively shooting down the hallway, just a barrage of bullets, and I’m staring at him thinking why are the police here,this is strange because he’s in full metal garb, helmet, face mask, bulletproof armor, shooting this rifle that I’ve never seen before,” Lippel told Good Morning America last Wednesday.

              They were hoaxes too. We are dealing with insane people here, and the media that reports these events as true are totally compromised. Then you've got the shills who reinforce the lies by putting out fake counter-narratives. The classic shill story is the "second shooter"

               I thought the Vegas shooting was extremely fishy, there was too many things that didn't add up and out right holes in the story. I think that op was poorly executed. How about the Pulse nightclub shooting?

            I've been thinking the same thing, but if you don't agree with government and the mainstream media who always seem to be in agreement, then you're a crazy conspiracy theorist. Even after the JFK crazy conspiracy theorists were proven correct, people still don't seem to have abandoned trusting the government and their mainstream media machine.

            Also, in the one video of the shooting, you definitely hear 2 different guns going off. They state only an AR15, where’s the pistol that I hear going off?

            i forgot to add the plain fact that CNN has had the grubby mits all over this thing from the start makes it all stink so much more.  they just couldnt wait for that townhall with the scripted questions and the Two Minutes of Hate style mob attacks on Rubio and the NRA woman Donna Loesch.

            EMT's were prevented from going in to help victims at the order of the sheriff department, same group that had 4 armed deputies manning the perimeter throughout the shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            A student walked out of the building with Nikolas Cruz, in plain clothes, while shooting was happening on the other side of the building.

            Nikolas Cruz was captured while walking home.

            I'm 100% with you that the authorities had an extremely good idea that Cruz was a loose cannon and was a good candidate to either shoot the school or blame the school shooting on.  With this knowledge in hand it becomes easy to script what happens afterwards.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know the truthfulness of this:

            but it sure makes a fuck ton of sense and makes major crime inevitable.

             i read that as well and it just factors in perfectly to make me believe this was all orchestrated and planned very carefully.  the left and the deepstate have even got trump to make some statements about banning bump stocks and other possible measures.  if trump goes gun grabber MAGA is over and wont come back ever.  i hope trump is just saying the right thing at the right moment with no intention to back it up but we wont know until something happens.

            On the last point, kids are highly suggestible and people love to hear kids talk passionately about stuff.  You can get the effect from 5 minutes of skilled talk with a kid to lead them to "concluding" the point you desire and then helping them phrase what they think is their own thoughts.  Then you film the interview.  And if it goes wrong you toss the interview and pick another kid.  It's very plausible to manufacture teen activists without any conspiracy involved.  Just very strong production and selective reporting.

            You would have a better chance winning the power ball lottery than all these things randomly falling into place to fit the gun grab narrative. CNN just happens to have an insider who's been molded from childhood, by mommy CNN and daddy FBI, to be the face of the gun grab revolution. These people don't fake random events very well.

<p>In the above link the UT Austin Police Chief states that Kendrex White had been committed to an out of state psychiatric facility (<a href="http://www.crimeonline.com/2017/05/03/ut-austin-murder-suspect-kendrex-white-had-recently-been-committed-to-psychiatric-hospital/">http://www.crimeonline.com/2017/05/03/ut-austin-murder-suspect-kendrex-white-had-recently-been-committed-to-psychiatric-hospital/)</a>).</p>
<p>The family of the suspect, though, did not seem to know that their son was going through such a difficult time mentally (<a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/breaking-news/family-stabbing-suspect-issues-first-statement-since-deadly-knife-attack/TRmGYMKIgrdoruTh6FQAPO/">according to their statement</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe he was influenced in some way during his admission to the hopsital?  I mean a simple thing like hypnosis works if someone can be persuaded it\'s the right thing to do subconsciously (remember this for later).</p>
<p>And there is a general narrative being painted (forgive the pun) about <a href="http://www.speroforum.com/a/DMADLJISLP1/80708-Racism-may-have-been-motivation-of-Univ-of-Texas-stabbing-attack#.WQxi183B_IU">graffiti found on fraternity houses saying things like \'rapist\' and \'kill frat boys\'</a>.

<p>And lastly the narrative about the suspect is that he held anti-white views (remember the subconscious aspect needed for hypnosis) because he made <a href="http://www.speroforum.com/a/DMADLJISLP1/80708-Racism-may-have-been-motivation-of-Univ-of-Texas-stabbing-attack#.WQxi183B_IU">a school project video about the Haitian Revolution of 1791 and an anonymous white-hatred manifesto was published last month</a>.  And yet in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXwG4H33IWc">this video</a> a white classmate says that he sat next to Kendrex and he was always a nice normal guy.</p>

            Israeli expansion makes a lot of sense.  I don't agree with the article with amount of predicted expansion, but this (to me) seems most likely.

            As the Russians have recently demonstrated, the US could've curbstomped IS in Syria any time they liked, but they chose not to. They've been dragging out the war in Syria and possibly arming IS for over year... Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because Islamic State is the best thing that's happened to the US government since 9/11. You can't have a "War on Terror" without any actual terrorists. Every night on the news you've got pictures of masked men waving black flags and hating America, the only thing they're missing is a mustache to twirl. They're almost the perfect bad guys, they're no real threat to the USA, but they scare the public and keep people distracted. It gives the government justification for more 'security' and spying or anything else they want to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The massive refugee crisis is more of an unintended consequence, but not a negative one from the US government perspective. It's likely the US has been using it's influence in Saudi Arabia and Israel to steer the refugees toward Europe. While China may be in the news all the time as the next potential threat to US hegemony, that doesn't mean it's the only one. Russia's resurgence is also a concern. But the US has always been concerned about Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            (That's why the US entered WW2 in Europe, not because they thought Nazis were bad guys, not because they were concerned about the welfare of their British cousins. It was because a unified Europe under Nazi control, with direct access to the Middle East and North Africa would be a serious economic and military power.)
           </p>
           <p>
            A unified, cohesive Europe Union could likewise pose a significant threat to the USA's economic power. It was the US that pushed the European Union to expand rapidly and accept former Soviet States, this was partly to prevent them falling back under Soviet/Russian influence and partly because rapidly expanding the EU beyond the original members to include less wealthy and stable countries would weaken the EU economically and cause internal conflict (eg Greece was not part of the original EU, see: Greek financial crisis). Likewise the USA pushed for Turkey to be admitted to the EU because the wildly different cultures would be bound to cause internal conflict, and Turkey would be a route for middle eastern immigration into Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's been standard US foreign policy for well over a century to deliberately undermine the internal stability of any foreign nation that might potentially pose a future threat to American economic dominance. We've seen what they did to South America, they did it in the middle east, and now they're doing it to the EU.
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll notice that the US is doing absolutely nothing to help with the refugee crisis. In fact the only thing they have been doing in Syria is preventing other nations from taking action. And the only thing they're doing now is threatening Russia, the only country that 
is actually doing something that would end the problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            The USA doesn't want a strong cohesive European Union, they want a weak collection of states with open trade, that will be little more than an American puppet. One that's just strong enough to fend off Russian influence, just strong enough to be a useful lap dog, but not strong enough to ever be a credible economic competitor or military threat.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US government doesn't want IS defeated, they don't even want democracy in the middle east. They want everyone to keep fighting so they can keep pointing out how dangerous and scary the world is, so their own population will happily accept 'increased security'.

            That all was planned by the US. First they ruin the climate so many farmers are forced to give up their farms and the unemployed add up in the cities. Then they support many extremist groups with money and weapons to spark a civil war. They continue to support various groups who are fighting against Assad and help them with air strikes.

            Forced Islamization of Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Turks and Arabs have wanted to Islamize Europe for 1400 years, it's no surprise that most migrants are coming via Turkey -- Erdogan believes he can create a neo-Ottoman empire in Syria and push Turkish influence through the Balkans and up to Austria where it was in the 15th century. The Gulf Arabs refuse to take any migrants, so the migrants are forced towards Europe by the terrorism the Gulf Arabs sponsor. Once there, the Saudis have offered to build 200 mosques, thus speeding up the Islamic invasion of Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a pan-Islamic conspiracy to destabilize Europe assisted by globalists who see it as an opportunity to eliminate Western unions, free speech and labor conditions with a wave of cheap brown laborers.

            The Rothschild's and J.P. Morgans do not have all the money in the world so they are trying to fix that.  They are trying to kill all currency to create a world bank where they can rule over all.  Were sucked into wars in places we have no business in only to destabilize their financial systems.  The United States has to be in constant war state to pay for the products their government contractors produce.  IMPO there is no purpose for our military to be anywhere outside our borders, except for private business profits.  I have also not learned how to shoot myself in back of the head three times.

            Russian agents, posing as Israelis, paid the transit costs of refugees to settle and destabilize all European countries that threaten or oppose Russian Natural Gas Monopoly in European countries. The goal is to raise the price of LNG before winter starts and then keep it up.

            Well let's consider what happened in Lybia. There were protests going on in opposition of Gaddafi, but they didn't get  violent until (false) rumours started spreading that Gaddafi was actually importing the waves of black immigrant labourers as mercenaries to quell the protesters. Then the Muslims(or Chechen mercenaries employed by the US state Dept.) started violence against the black immigrants which was met with violence from Gaddafi's police forces which were then bombed illegally by the West which led to the current of Chaos that currently exists there.

            So... probably the same exact shit is planned for the EU and the US. Bring in loads of peaceful immigrants. Fuel rumours that the immigrants are violent. Commit vigilante violence against the immigrants in the name of National security, forcing the government to either (endorse racism outright, or (defy their nationalist constituency. In either case creating a false flag civil war and the pretext for foreign intervention. Things could get really ugly.

           <p>
            And if that all doesn't work they'll try the same exact gambit but with aliens. or something.

            what may be a possibility, is that with the fbis recent push from "terrerists" to "extreeeemists", the spots in voat, and other like places, of racist anti-imigration types may be deliberately seeded and fostered, in part to raise the "threat visibility" among the people who aren't in those spots, hence their acceptance of the fbis changing target, if that's the clearest way of saying it.

            tldr: grow some racist shitholes, say your gonna hunt those racist shitholes, but also, make those holes look bigger to trick everybody.

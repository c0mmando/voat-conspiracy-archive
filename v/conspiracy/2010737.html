            Pretty much.

            It is interesting how people are so upset about Trump being President.  However, they are completely oblivious to the hidden power structure that is always in place no matter who the President is.  They never complain about that for some reason.

             Oh that's because you're proposing a "conspiracy theory". I want hard evidence, otherwise I am going to deny anything you say.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not intellectual enough to grasp a theory and entertain it for a moment because I would rather stay in my comfort bubble and call considerations like this a conspiracy theory.

              I know... I know...  I provide hard evidence, and it is dismissed.  LOL.  People will believe what they want to believe.  It is what makes them "cattle".

              A cow just needs food, water, and shelter.  It does not consider the nature of the planes flying overhead.  It does not wonder who made them or why.  It does not think about where they came from or where they are going, or how they stay in the air.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cattle people are the same.  They never wonder how things work, or why.  They just keep chewing their cud.

               I like the cow analogy. Although,  if someone called me a conspiracy theorist, I like to think I'd be a bit more diplomatic than, "You're like a cow that doesn't care about how they get their fodder man..."

                Hahaha!   I only recently watched Mystery Babylon.  I started to last Fall, but the intro put me off.  I like to listen to videos when I am trying to fall asleep, and the intro is not conducive to that.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyways, what I took from the first two episodes is that a long time ago, a group of people wanted to accomplish a goal, but the goal was too complicated to be accomplished in one lifetime.  They did what they could, then told the next generation about the goal and made them promise to keep working towards it.  As a reward, the wealth and power acquired in one generation was passed along to the next.  This was done again and again, and now "100 generations" have passed.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe this is what we are dealing with today.  This group has the wealth and knowledge that has been acquired through 100 generations, and the goal is now within reach.  I am not sure what to call this group now or 100 generations ago when it started.  Maybe the Illuminati now and the Knights Templar then.  The Freemasons, Jesuits, Rosicurians, Rothschild Zionists also come to mind.  Maybe they are separate or overlapping groups working together.
               </p>
               <p>
                Either way, the goal is world domination-The New World Order with a one-world government.
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/MADYzQstpsU">
                 https://youtu.be/MADYzQstpsU
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                Human cattle are not as good at passing along knowledge and wealth from one generation to the next.  The attitude of human cattle is that the parents want the children to go through their suffering instead of "having it easy".  Each generation starts over.
               </p>
               <p>
                You probably already know all of this, but...  maybe others will read this and become Illumined.

                 This connects to Astral soldiers like Max Spiers and hundreds, if not thousands of Secret Space Program whistleblowers. The Nazis were one blatant outcome of this ancient priesthood style command and control structure, but just one manifestation. Then we could start connecting these dots to religions (Vatican to some churches) and the global ponzi financial system etc.

                 This is one of the reasons why most people deny signs, and events that point to evil running the world, p1zz@g@te is a good example of this consistent form of denial. It's so vastly complex that 99% of people will just dismiss any and all related conspiracies.

                  Yep.  We think alike.  Pretty crazy times we are in.  It will change for the better if we keep pushing.  I think Hitler had pushed the bankers to the brink, but he did not finish the job.   He should have focused on the bankers instead of poor Jews.   Hitler had captured a Rothschild, but ransomed him.  That was a huge mistake to give away that leverage.

             What most minions don't realize, and probably don't want to believe, is that most politicians and executives in high power positions see the majority of the population as a sub-species.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most democrats and Republicans would not care to keep up appearances even further and actually debate legitimate policies. Nor would either side want to step back from the circus talk, I'd argue most like the media circus because they see it as confusing the sub-species that are most cutizens, which is desirable to maintain status quo.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would go so far as to argue that even a NEWLY elected politician that does not think this way to start,
             <em>
              will
             </em>
             within three years of indoctrination, constant cocktail parties with fellow bankers, psychopathic politicians and financiers. This is how tptb operate, brainwashing, forcing tasks against their will. Watch "BIS insider" or whistle-blower. His name is Ronald Bernard or similar. I'm sure that video is getting censored on YT on a daily basis.

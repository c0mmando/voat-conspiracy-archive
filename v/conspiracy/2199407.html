<p>The 2006 Mexico DC-9 drug bust (also called \'Cocaine 1\' because it was painted to impersonate a US government plane)[1] followed after the emergency landing of an aging DC-9 which was not fit to fly.[2] On April 10, 2006, en route from from Venezuela to USA, this suffered an engine failure and made an emergency landing in Mexico, where its cargo of over 5 tonnes of cocaine was discovered. Michael Braun, Chief of Operations of the DEA testified to the US Congress that 5.6 tonnes of cocaine were found aboard the plane.[3] Arrests were made, but the pilot and the plane both &quot;disappeared&quot;. </p>

            If he is truly from the Rothschild family, he'd be a trillionaire as a descendant of Amschel, Philip, or Natahan etc. Believe it or not, JP Morgan (therefore any descendents), David Rockefeller (his benefactors), George Soros (one of today's democracy manipulators and his son) are all billionaires but are also mere lieutenants to the top Rothschild family heads.

            </a>
            - see Max Spiers interviews for corroboration because he mentions in two different interviews that the Rothschild family is at the top. Also see Creature from Jekyll Island (book), this documents the fact that the Rothschild family created central banks, from which they are profiting to thus day. And a few other sources (for doubters, at least three points to this all being factual, and these are more than three sources.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said all that, he is more powerful - if he truly is a descendant (there are many that are not connected to the original family wealth of Amschel), than you might realize.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest you play dumb, but try to get some time with him, even for a few brief conversations, if you get the chance, ask him what he does for for a living, what he did last weekend.
           </p>
           <p>
            Document everything. You never know what will happen in the future. Your summary post here for example might provide evidence for a future investigation. I'm not saying he's evil because there are many descendants in that family who are really not and not connected to the multi-trillion dollar estate, so don't try to be a spy and get busted breaking and entering or something stupid.

            Play nice and take notes. And if he doesn't know that you fucked his lady back in the day, be the one to tell him, but make sure that you buy the beers. Telling a guy that you banged his girlfriend never goes well if he just bought you some top shelf booze.

            Ok, bud. So this is your first rich friend, I take it? People on the sub might know the source of this advice, they might rankle, but... Silence and circumspection.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of rich people are controlled by their banks and don't have too much power? Get to see things from his point of view. It will instill the lesson that we're all fucked by the roles we have to play...

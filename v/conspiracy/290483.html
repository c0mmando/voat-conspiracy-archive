            So you're saying in the crazy event, that someone really did put on a big show. A huge staged event, where a shuttle gets destroyed. But that someone would not be capable of putting some body parts at the crash site?
           </p>
           <p>
            If there was something going on and the crew really was spared I would say they never entered the shuttle. But instead the shuttle was prepped with body parts.

            Edit: Removed "pretty good" from the description of the snopes debunking, it isn't very thorough either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Snopes does has a debunking of
            <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/challenger.asp">
             this
            </a>
            , with as much effort as the person who put OP's link together.
           </p>
           <p>
            TL:DR; Two of the "doppelgangers" are brothers and I don't find it hard to believe siblings resemble each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look into the other people's backgrounds you see that they have a paper trail of public profile jobs and/or education records.  Sure those could be faked by the government, but why go through the effort?  Their resemblence doesn't really hold up under a closer look at some key features.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is not really an explanation offered for why whoever "planned" this wanted to fake the astronauts deaths and blow up the shuttle, and if anyone can come up with a why for the shuttle needing to be destroyed, why would those responsible for it go through the trouble of saving them?
           </p>
           <p>
            Wouldn't it have just been easier to sabotage the shuttle, any clandestine operation would likely consider the astronauts as expendable.

              I don't think you are wrong, it is just one resource that can be used for most people who aren't going to do their own reasearch.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was hesitant to link it at all, but becuase of the realtively quick read that brought up the same things I was thinking when reading OP's link I went ahead and linked it since I wasn't going to do any more research than Snopes already did for such a flimsy theory.
             </p>
             <p>
              People definitely shouldn't just see snopes debunk something and take it as correct, and I didn't mean to imply that people should do the same here.  I'm just putting that into the conversation.

             Snopes doesn't do a convincing job in debunking this theory for me. On the other hand I still fail to see a motive on why bother with such a huge deception.

              <em>
               The disaster resulted in a 32-month hiatus in NASA’s shuttle program and the formation of the Rogers Commission, a special commission appointed by then President Ronald Reagan to investigate the accident. The commission found NASA’s organizational culture and decision-making processes had been key contributing factors to the accident.

              Well they completely redesigned the solid rocket boosters (the ones witht he faulty o-ring) used in the shuttle program.
             </p>
             <p>
              They created a Safety and Quality Assurance office which made minor changes to the administrative structure of NASA.
             </p>
             <p>
              Funding increased by 0.1% of GDP in 1988 and another 0.1% in 1989, from 0.76% GDP from 1985 through 1987 to 0.99% in 1990, as well as a temporary renewed interest by the public when the program started back up in Sept. 1988.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm certainly not saying that the event didn't have consequences and results, I just don't know who would have benefited enough to offset the loss of the shuttle and the program's setback for almost 3 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Snopes doesn't completely debunk it but as I said they put as much effort as the original article linked, that is to say a cursory look at it and some ancestry and SSID research.  Other than tracking down evidence and testimony from colleagues and university peers for those involved I don't know what else they could do to debunk what is already fairly tenative "proof".

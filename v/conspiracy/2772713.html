<ol>
<li>
<p>Make the people more materialistic and make them squander any spiritual gifts they may have on material desires. Make them serve material desires, fantasize and dream to that end, thus increasing their material attachment. This will lead to them committing fruitive actions and thus binding themselves, through karma, to this cycle of births and deaths (reincarnation). This way they will always be trapped in this material universe, with no chance of escaping to the spiritual universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pacify them. If one believes that only dreaming feverishly of a material desire will make it manifest in their lives, they will stop improving themselves. They will think that simply \'believing\' in perfection will make them perfect. That simply \'believing\' their reality is good will make it so. They will stop making efforts to improve their lot in life. Ultimately, when the Secret does not work for them, they will become jaded and frustrated, either thinking that they are not capable of believing in something totally (thus becoming demotivated and depressed), or thinking that it is a lie (it is), and discounting all other mysteries as hoaxes as well (many are true).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheapening gratitude. We are supposed to have gratitude to Lord Sri Krishna, for giving us this human form of life, whose only purpose is to achieve god-realization and liberation from the material world. We are supposed to have gratitude that he has given us a chance to serve him by granting us existence as a spirit soul, his part and parcel. We are supposed to have gratitude that He exists, as a worthy object and repository of our natural feelings of affection and love. Gratitude is a very pure and unselfish emotion, unconditional and a means to deepen our relationship with God. It can be very powerful. Instead the NWO seek to pollute it with material desires, make it conditional, expecting the result of improving our life through it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make people more lusty. According to Srila Prabhupada, the basis for this material existence is sexual desire. Most people are desiring for sex, one way or another. They either want to be rich and settled so they can host the women of their dreams, or directly desire sex. This causes them to fantasize about sex constantly. Since the Secret doesn\'t work (more on this later), they become sexually frustrated and we all know what that leads to. Porn, depression, feelings of unworthiness, crimes, misogyny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make people desire to be God. Maya has two traps to keep the conditioned souls bound to the material universe. The first is the sexual desire. The second is the final trick maya plays on a nearly liberated soul - tell him/her that They are God. The Secret does the same thing. People start thinking they are vibration and they can achieve infinitely higher vibrational states through \'positive thinking\' (read : desiring material desires very strongly). No doubt, there are lower and higher states of consciousness. Vibration does matter, and plays a huge part in shaping consciousness, but not in the way these people would have you believe. In any case, they start thinking that they are the God of their reality, and all they have to do is to keep themselves in a positive state, and that believing in good/bad, right/wrong, karma etc. is all negative thinking. This couldn\'t be further from the truth. The truth is that Lord Sri Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, an independent, primeval, eternal being who has created all of reality, and is the Supreme Personal Absolute Truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make people thought police themselves. If one thinks that whatever one believes will manifest into one\'s reality, they will shy away from dwelling on important conspiracies and negative actions of others. Actually, doing so only makes us more knowledgeable and motivates us to develop counters and be aware of those wrongdoings, instead of somehow helping the actions by giving \'belief-power\' (invented term) to them. So people are scared and pulled into two directions - to ponder over aliens or to not, to think of jews or to not, are we bringing them into our world more strongly? Am I feeding a thoughtform of Jesus Christ by thinking of him? (no he\'s a genuine spiritual personality, he doesn\'t depend on your belief to exist). So many conundrums and contradictions result from this type of painful thinking. It is very stressful.</p>

            So what are "material desires"? Is desiring to make the world a better place material? Is desiring to improve the situation of others or yourself material? If you desired literal material resources like money to help others, or construct a work of art, is that still a material desire? If you desired power, is that a material desire? Where is the line of material?
           </p>
           <p>
            The line between passivity and acceptance is tricky but it is there. Accepting things, realizing things for what they are, is not the same as being passive. People should accept and realize the horrible things that are going on in this world, and not ask the (((government))) for more help and give up their power up. I've seen so many people arguing "it's 2018, this is unaceptable! We must do anything to stop this!" but that makes things worse. Worring about things doesn't help at all either, only makes things worse. Sometimes positive thinking really works because it reframes problems as "why do I even care about this" "even if the worst happens so what".
           </p>
           <p>
            Part of the law of attraction is acting as if what you wanted has already happened, so even if their desires never come to pass they should be training their mind to be positive regardless, so they shouldn't become frustrated. Unless of course if they're paying money for this information, then of course they're being scammed and if their desires don't come they'll become tremendously upset. If done right I don't see a fundamental issue with law of attraction like concepts. From your explanation it seems more accurate to say law of attraction is incomplete - you can attract things but doing so sacrifices karmic energy that you earn through good deeds etc. Though the idea that you are actually cursing yourself by making a soul contract for a future life is concerning.
           </p>
           <p>
            The biggest lesson I've learned here in this life is authority is absolutely not to be trusted whatsoever. No matter how we're trained or hold. (((They))) are evil or insane, maybe both. And their followers are so compartmentalized that they have no idea what they're doing. They think their actions will make things better, or grant their desires and grant them power at the expense of others, all the while it's doing neither and instead it's making them suffer and the world suffer. So for as long as I exist, so long as I remember, no matter how far I go, how many reincarnations or "ascentions" - I will always be looking for the Jew or Archon hiding behind the curtain. Belief in the idea that a higher level of existance is being deliberately hidden. That the authority is not on my side whether knowingly or unknowingly for good reason or not. I stake my existance on this. If "god" ends up destroying me for this transgression I'm okay with that. I will not follow others, not after what I've seen. I may associate or do actions for others, even be manipulated by others, but I will not serve them. If this is what the dark entities desire, to make people distrust "god", then so be it - they have succeeded. I have no doubt that Prabhupada's work is useful and that he was a good man. But I will not serve, no matter what.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Has the new age movement actually been pushed strongly? Society is completely bound to materialism. Rejecting any "metaphysical" or "paranormal" phenomena as something humanity has grown out of, that "we're so advanced now we don't need silly superstition". That somehow science is right because the scientific method is set up so mistakes will be realized, while at the same time you can't question the scientific consensus because that's ignorant. That somehow blindly supporting dogma refusing questions is compatible with figuring out mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            To my understanding the reason why it's named new age in the first place was that 2012 has astrological significance for an awakening of mankind. But the (((media))) promoted the idea that it was considered the date for the end of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the new age doesn't seem to be a cohesive movement either. It's more like a buzzword or search keyword, like "occult". I mean you can say it's controlled opposition, a limited hangout operation. And obviously (((they))) subvert literally everything so bad actors abound, especially the (((mainstream))) sources. But limited hangout operations can help people realize what's going on regardless of their nefarious intentions. What's most important is the seed of doubt cast upon all authorities society deems credible, which can branch out to realizing bigger picture things. Of course you can't fully trust anything, not even yourself. There is a lot of information everywhere, but its been ofusculated misunderstood and deliberately corrupted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've seen this line of thought from Christians too - the new age being used for the NWOs one world religion. But I don't feel like this makes sense, because I thought one of the fundamental new age ideas was the distrust of religious authorities, that information on metaphysics and occult has been forcefully supressed. I feel like labels aren't as useful as people think they are - words can be many different things to many different people, so it's the meaning behind them that matters. All major religious authorities are absolutly corrupted, often from not that long after the religions inception.
           </p>
           <p>
            And things get muddled because there are conflicting interests at work. I thought all this vegetarianism and veganism was entirely UN Agenda 21 talk, promoting empty unhealthy carbs. But the concept makes more sense when you realize the final step is being breatharian - absorbing energy without food.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I've encountered that greentext post isn't accurate? Though I have no idea what 'official new age' is so it's probably be 100% right in what they've encountered, materialism and nihilism is popular after all. Where as I've only looked at random youtube videos and websites loosely connected to the concept. Though the idea of concepts, religions, promoted or corrupted as a government psyop is of course true. CIA creating or coopting hippie movmeent. The Roman Emperor Constantine was involved in shaping Christianity... etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            To begin with Fat Budh was a nephilim.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwPzJWNtHYE">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwPzJWNtHYE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is the idea of "All is one, one is all.". That there is the single central point, the "godsource", from which everything is derived from. The "godsource" is the universe experiencing itself, through every individual and collective entity. So the individual is an "illusion", but on the other hand the individual does clearly exist on some level. However no matter on what level you look everything is connected. As you are connected and part of the "godsource", you can claim you are "god". You can use the connection to everything and the "godsource" to shape the world with thoughs/beliefs/prayer at some level. However everyone and everything else is "god" as well. So harming other people will infact harm you as well. There is no need to balance suffering and joy, things can get infinitely better and infinitely worse. So scarcity doesn't really exist. Concepts of "Service to self" where you improve things by helping and improving yourself and your gains, as you are "god" improving yourself will cause improvement in others. And "Service to others" where helping and improving others improves yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you could argue from this perspective that it's all just god playing a game with himself and thus it's meaningless... but I don't feel like that perspective is valid. Playing is used to learn, and video games hold significance to me so I cannot call such a thing meaningless.

              But I don't feel like this makes sense, because I thought one of the fundamental new age ideas was the distrust of religious authorities, that information on metaphysics and occult has been forcefully supressed.

            <p>
             This is precisely why they push it so strongly. so that everyone is misdirected towards the occult and looks upon the real saviour religions with distrust.

             Material desires do include mundane charity. The only acceptable charity is preaching to people about krishna consciousness, or charity which will enable them to discharge devotional service, since "compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless" (
             <a href="https://asitis.com/2/1.html">
              https://asitis.com/2/1.html
             </a>
             ).
            </p>
            <p>
             Your other questions have answers which are too long. I encourage you to study Srila Prabhupada's books with an open mind. Even if you don't believe it, at least take the best from this philosophy of krishna consciousness. It has a lot of worthwhile things. I hope your attitude of being okay with committing transgressions against God changes. It will hurt your spiritual development.

              When I called it a transgression I meant the possibility that "god" would consider it a transgression to refuse to serve it or acknowledge it as the most high out of distrust. I don't think that is a transgression, and I don't believe "god" would consider it a transgression either. An entity pretending to be god yes. But in the end I know nothing so I cannot say anything really. Obviously deliberately performing a transgression against "god" would accomplish nothing.

             This is the true according to the vedic scriptures. If you accept them as an authentic source of information then you have to accept the fact of Lord Sri Krishna being the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If you don't then I can't help you. Here is the list of quotes from vedic scriptures -

             In reference to point 5, it is not possible to become equal to or greater than God. One can attain mystic abilities and show some power, but Lord Sri Krishna will always outdo them because he is full in infinite quantity with the 6 basic opulences - wealth, fame, beauty, strength, knowledge, and renunciation. No one can ever match him. That is why He is known as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We can merge with his impersonal Brahman effulgence (think of becoming the sunlight coming from the sun, but the sun is one) but that is an inferior form of liberation. The highest form is to render transcendental devotional service unto His divine lotus feet in a personal, loving relationship.

             Please don't fall for the trap of thinking you are, or can become God, and have simply 'entered the experience' of being a powerless individual or have somehow 'forgotten that you are God'. These are mayavadi (impersonal) theories and Srila Prabhupada warned against them many times. Here is a good article on it -
             <a href="https://krishna.org/why-we-criticize-mayavadis/">
              https://krishna.org/why-we-criticize-mayavadis/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, many people say that all deities are forms of the one formless God. That also comes under the above philosophy.

He is better advised to chant the maha-mantra: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

               You are being unfair. You have taken most of these quotes not from the article itself, but from the comments section. People write all kinds of things in the comments, is the writer of the article responsible for them? Also, Srila Prabhupada advocated logic, argument, and philosophy often. Here are some real quotes -

                 "The whole world is being misled by the blind leaders; they are keeping the people in darkness. Our present position is that we have got this human form of life after a great evolutionary process and this is the opportunity to understand God Krishna, and revive our original consciousness without which we are sure to go back to the cycle of birth and death.
Krishna Consciousness movement is trying to save the people in general, religionists and philosophers, to save them from the downfall. Opening our center means to educate people in this great science. Krishna Consciousness is not a ism or simply blind following. It is based on authority; scientific and logical."

                 "Kavirāja Gosvāmī says, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra, vicāra karile citte pābe camatkāra (CC Adi 8.15): 'Just see what kind of merciful is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And if you consider it perfectly, you'll see it it wonderful.' Vicāra karile citte pābe camatkāra. 'Oh, here is Caitanya.' Caitanya. Caitanya means living force. He says vicāra. 'Just try to understand by logic, by philosophy, by argument.' That is vicāra. We are not following Caitanya Mahāprabhu blindly. That is not our position.

                 "There are certain class of men who are simply philosophizing and there are certain class of men who are simply blindly following religious ritualistic process. So Bhagavad-gītā is combination of both. That is scientific. You should be religious, but should understand everything philosophically. Otherwise one becomes fanatic, religious fanatic. In the Caitanya-caritāmṛta it is clearly said that caitanyera dayāra kathā karaha vicāra. You people, you try to understand the gifts of Caitanya Mahāprabhu by your philosophical understanding. Not blindly, philosophically. And vicāra karile citte pāibe camatkāra. If you are actually a wise man, then you'll find it is sublime. And if you simply stick to your own religious ritualistic principles, don't try to understand the philosophy of everything, then you become a fanatic. So we should not become religious fanatics, nor dry mental speculators. Both these classes of men are dangerous. They cannot make any advance. The combination. You should be religious, but try to understand each and every line philosophically. Just like in the Bible there is the statement, 'God created this universe.' It is a fact. But because modern educated persons have not explained how God created, how the process of creation... These things are explained in the Bhāgavata, how the sky became in existence, then the air became in existence, the fire became in existence. There is a process, general graduation. Actually, God has created the world. There is no doubt about it. But because it is not philosophically explained, the modern educated persons, they don't accept. So Bhagavad-gītā you'll find everything. A combination of religious sentiments plus philosophical understanding. That is wanted."

               <li>
                <p>
                 So to know God and how things are working and how it is being controlled, these things are to be known. We should not go simply by sentiment. Religious sentiment is good for persons who follow blindly. But at the present moment, people are advanced in so-called education. So Bhagavad-gītā gives you full information so that you can accept God with your reason, with your argument, with your knowledge. It is not blind following. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a sentiment. It is backed by knowledge and practical knowledge. Vijñāna. Jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitam."

                 "Bhagavad-dūtas, those who are gosvāmīs, they place everything with nyāya, or logic. Their instructions are not blind, dogmatic. Naya-kovidāḥ. Everything what is said by Kṛṣṇa or His representative, they are not dogmas. Those who are not representative of Kṛṣṇa, they will say simply dogmas. Just like in every religion there is a dogma. But in bhāgavata religion, bhāgavata-dharma, there is no dogma. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's bhāgavata-dharma, the Caitanya-caritāmṛta's author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, says therefore that caitanyera dayāra kathā karaha vicāra (CC Adi 8.1). Vicāra means you just try to understand the gift of Lord Caitanya by logic, vicāra. Don't follow blindly.
Following blindly something, that is not good. That will not stay. But one should take everything with logic. But the servants of God, they put everything in logic. Caitanyera dayāra kathā karaha vicāra. If you study the Caitanya's philosophy with logic and argument... Don't go by sentiment.
The so-called missionary, they're simply bogus propaganda, without any logic. Without any logic. Just like some missionary people are propagating a man to become God. How a man can become God? There must be evidences how God incarnates. Not that somebody by worshiping a demigod becomes God. So many false propaganda is going on. That is not logical at all. So one should be intelligent to understand the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa or philosophy of Lord Caitanya with logic and argument. Don't follow blindly."

                 God is everything in the sense that He is the source of everything and everything exists in him. The philosophy of Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (the golden avatar of Krishna) is called achintya-bheda-abheda-tattva. It refers to the inconceivable oneness and difference of the Supreme Person and His energies. This is one of the key points of this theistic philosophy. As parts of God's energy, we're also equal in quality with God, but there's a vast difference in quantity. We're each infinitesimal sparks of spiritual energy, and the Supreme Person, Krishna, is the infinite, supreme source of all energies.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Some parts of the Vedas say that all beings are one with God, and others say that God is different from all beings. Vedanta philosophers have long argued back and forth about this, but Chaitanya Mahaprabhu taught that both statements are simultaneously true.

                 If your room has sunshine you won't say the sun is in your room, but the presence of the sun is manifest in the room. Similarly everything is an energy of God, including us. But God is different from His energy. So a stone is not Krishna, a tree is not Krishna, but they are

                   No because God wants to enjoy a relationship with the living entities. As for the entities without souls (stones, plastic etc.) they are merely his energies. A relationship won't be possible if everything was God because one can't have a relationship with oneself. The questions you are asking are actually very advanced topics that can't be understood unless one revives his relationship with God. There are some very fine distinctions that are only understandable by elevated vaishnavas who have experiential knowledge and not mere mental speculation. I myself don't claim to understand this perfectly. Also, God, being limitless, can never be understood perfectly. Many aspects of Him will remain inconceivable. I just want to enlighten people about the absolute reality as it stands.

                    Can God, in his omniscience, understand Himself perfectly?

               Please don't fall for the trap of thinking you are, or can become God, and have simply 'entered the experience' of being a powerless individual or have somehow 'forgotten that you are God'. These are mayavadi (impersonal) theories and Srila Prabhupada warned against them many times.

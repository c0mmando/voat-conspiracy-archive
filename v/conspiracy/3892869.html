            I'd LOVE to get a discussion going on theories as to WHY this is being SO highly looked at, funded and researched by many people of certain 'types'. Whether it's jews, rich and corrupt, evil people, those without religion in their lives, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            My personal thoughts on this, mind you this is after a long personal journey where I was raised Catholic, and seeked aliens, only to find God. I was as surprised as I could ever imagine, and quite sheepish the first few years, as I had laughed so much at those who I ended up joining. My apologies to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The opinion I hold, is that heaven and hell are very much real, or rather, at least heaven is real and it's counter may be up to debate simply because it's existence does not really change this theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those who either do not believe they can get into heaven, or do not believe a heaven exists, very much wish to create their own version of heaven, which they can be sent to upon their death or even sooner.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also the remaining group, who not only knows the existence of heaven and hell and satan, and the truth of aliens really being demons/angels who are misrepresenting themselves or being misrepresented. They also know that in order for their heaven to be THEIR heaven, they will need to have what they currently have on earth. POWER and INFLUENCE over PEOPLE. It isn't enough to be happy, it must be that their happiness stems from others misery and suffering. In a way, they seek to make this virtual heaven into others virtual hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, it is a known 'goal' for satan to find a way to walk among the people, with his power and influence, creating authority, and subjugating those who don't willingly give themselves to him.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the moment he is unable to do that, as it seems if the whole demon possession thing is real, it isn't enough to take over a person and live within their body. They can whisper 'advice' and exalt influence over them, but never truly be in control of the body.
           </p>
           <p>
            A way to 'fix' this for them, is the advent of A.I. and robots.
           </p>
           <p>
            What if, a method is found for demons, whatever you call them, to communicate with those in this realm, through a digital method? They can be viewed as "A.I." by those observers who don't realize what they're looking at or dealing with. Eventually the A.I., a demon/satan, can be 'uploaded' to a human body made for the uploading of A.I. Or something close enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any views and opinions and of course criticisms of this, please send my way.

            Same Lie as Original Gen 3: 1-7 "you will be like God (knowing good and evil)", Revelation 9: 1-12 "men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them", Those whom fall for this or are not deceived yet accept are dooming themselves...

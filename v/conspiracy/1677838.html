<p>&quot;Is the &quot;fat acceptance movement&quot; a conspiracy to end strong feminist lives earlier?</p>
<p>Hear me out.</p>
<p>Being overweight is not physically healthy. Shouldn\'t feminism encourage women to be the healthiest we can possibly be, rather than force us to accept a condition that will literally kill us?? </p>
<p>I believe fat acceptance is a ploy to end strong feminine lives earlier. Being healthy and at a normal BMI allows you to be able to fight for womens rights for YEARS longer than you would be if you are, you know, dead. </p>
<p>By pushing a message that &quot;overweight is sexy&quot;, I believe malicious forces are investing in the fact that overweight women will be too preoccupied with health concerns/too exhausted (most common symptom of being overweight) to fight for ourselves or care about politics. It ensures that we need to be taken care of, which to me is the complete OPPOSITE of what feminism is about!! By being healthy, exercising, eating raw foods and lean meats, and cutting out processed carbs, we are investing in a lifetime of feminism and standing up for our beliefs, rather than just 10 or 15 years.</p>

            How is "fat" defined - as a percentage above "normal" weight, body mass index, or social perception?  I mean, is this movement encouraging morbid obesity or acceptance of body types outside of the "anorexic model" standard?
           </p>
           <p>
            You are right though - there's increasingly more emphasis on men preferring larger, curvy, thick, round, etc. women -just not sure how this is defined. Good health should be the number one priority.

            Feminism is a conspiracy to commit genocide on whites. Period. All feminism is bad, no exceptions. You can't pick a "wave" to keep; none of it is good and NEVER HAS BEEN.
           </p>
           <p>
            These fat motherfuckers exist EXPLICITLY for the sole purpose of killing whites.

            Do these people suffer from legitimate mental retardation? Is this satire? This is truly incredible, because this doesn’t even properly represent their supposed cause: a dissatisfaction with society’s beauty standards. They should be destroying a representation of that–for example, a beauty magazine. This literally doesn’t even make any sense. Instead, they are destroying a representation of objectivity. An item used to measure, an item used to display the truth. They are destroying a symbolic representation of the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about this for a second. These fatties have, without realizing, shown the world, through metaphor, that their movement has nothing to do with oppression, but is instead entirely about their proud, collective denial of reality and their complete inability to handle the truth like functioning adults. They are literally admitting to the world their answer to reality is to scream and strike and destroy when confronted by it, like children who don’t get what they want.

            it is a plan to make us ALL unhealthy. consider the food that is available to people. most of it isnt even food.
           </p>
           <p>
            the "fat acceptance" bullshit is a ploy to distract our attention away from having a conversation about what we, as plebs, eat and instead focus that energy into pro/anti fat people ridiculousness that, by design, wont accomplish anything.

<p>After the first girl, you clearly hear him whisper at 0:35 &quot;we need diversity.&quot; Then, the 2nd girl starts by saying that she\'s pro-gun, wanted to be an NRA member, wanted to learn to hunt, and was fascinated by guns...but this experience (which isn\'t over yet) has changed her views. Clearly what he meant by &quot;we need diversity&quot; was that they needed diversity of opinion to strengthen their argument.

<p>I personally don\'t subscribe to the crisis actor theories for a number of reasons. I do believe some mass shooters are programmed. No idea if that\'s the case here, as I don\'t know much about the shooter. Google has done a good job of suppressing conspiracy videos, so for someone like me who has unplugged from the various conspiracy message boards, it\'s taking much longer to actually find conspiratorial views. The censorship has been extremely effective. Even though I don\'t believe the crisis actor theories from past shootings, I\'m always interested in familiarizing myself with the theories. If you have a video or a link that you think is a smoking gun or accurately summarizes the claims of conspiracy, please share a link. Thanks :)</p>

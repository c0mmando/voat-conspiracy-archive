I\'ve been listening to Savage\'s radio show for a few years, and before the election he was staunchly for Trump, but now that Trump is in office, suddenly Savage has turned on him. One day Savage will praise Trump to the heavens, and the next day he will rip into him. It has to do with Trump\'s refusal to go on Savage\'s radio show since the election.</p>
<p>Savage, a skinny little, stunted, old Jew whose real name is Michael Weiner, is without question the most egotistical prick I\'ve ever heard. He spends half his show time promoting his books, and when he isn\'t promoting his books, he\'s patting himself on the back for being such a genius.</p>
<p>The little fucker has complete contempt for his listeners. He won\'t even let them talk. They are lucky is they get a single sentence out, and only can manage that if it is a sentence agreeing with Savage. Not only does he cut his callers off, he doesn\'t bother to listen to them on those rare occasions he does let them squeeze out a few words, so that half the time the prick doesn\'t know what they were even calling about!</p>
<p>His mind is starting to go. Lately he\'s stumbling over his words, saying one thing when he means something else, and he can\'t remember the names of the people he is talking about to save his life. He makes up childish schoolyard names for them to try to hide the fact that he can\'t remember their actual names any more.</p>
<p>He\'s the nastiest, most venomous little reptile in the media. He often says that he has no friends, to which I say, no wonder. Who would want to spend time with this sour old bastard? He\'s been living in San Francisco for decades, and he used to carry a little purse around with him. I don\'t think it\'s difficult to figure out why he still lives in San Francisco while claiming to hate the city so much. It\'s the center of homosexuality for America. This is radio show host Mark Levin\'s opinion, and I have to agree with him. Everything about Savage screams old fag.</p>
<p>There is literally nothing about this selfish, egomaniacal old bastard that is likeable. He claims to have nationalistic and conservative opinions, but he won\'t say a single word against Israel. Savage is &quot;my tribe right or wrong&quot; to the hilt, while pretending to care about Christian values.</p>
<p>Even though Savage claims not to practice Judaism, and prides himself on his degrees, he is pathetically superstitious and reads horoscopes over the air and listens to psychics. He even reports on his fortune cookies.</p>
<p>He\'s riddled with mental quirks and disorders. He\'s a faddist when it comes to vitamins and nutrition. He doesn\'t like to shake hands or touch other people. He doesn\'t like to use public washrooms because he\'s afraid of germs. When his dog is sick, he turns the poor animal over to some outside handler so he doen\'t have to look at the beast. He jumps from subject to subject so fast, his listeners often don\'t even try to call in. He obviously has some kind of attention deficit disorder, along with his handwashing fetish. He\'s still obsessed abut not getting into the university he wanted to get into, some fifty-plus years after the fact, and every couple of weeks he tells the story about how his career was derailed by affirmative action.</p>
<p>I\'ve had it with this loonie-tune, evil old bastard. I don\'t care if, occasionally, he says something meaningful. It doesn\'t matter, because he never sticks with anything for more than a few minutes. The next day he\'s onto the exact opposite view like a terrier on a rat. He has no honor, no honesty, no consistency, and no charity. He once made a scholarship for university students, then spent a show complaining how those who received the scholarship money didn\'t even thank him for it. What an egomaniac!</p>',

            I don't see this as especially relevant.  Sorry for sounding jaded, but Bernie is just one of the pro-Israeli genocide funders running.  He voted to give Israel 4 BILLION dollars WHILE they were bombing a residential area in Palestine.  So..... It doesn't matter who you vote for or follow, or anything.  A candidate Israel wants who continues throwing money at the military industrial complex is going to win.  Bernie is just one of those choices, with no real fundamental differences to Obama, for example.

              Context.  Context matters.  The over all context is that the media is run by 6 zionist corporations who ultimately decide everything of importance.  Bernie being safe or not on stage will have little or no effect on who his zionist handlers eventually put in office.  We are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic during this whole conversation.

            Don't fool yourself into thinking any one candidate is any better. Remember to get to that position; that point of even being viable for the presidency, they must do horrible things. If Sanders is as true as he seems, he'll never make it past the primaries just like Mike Gravel, Dennis Kuninich or Paul. If he's not, than he's already playing the game and will turn into a puppet.
           </p>

            The vote in most countries, even ones with progressive voting systems like Australia and New Zealand, is still just purely symbolic.

            There is not a shadow of a doubt that the social movement called Black Lives Matter has been completely compromised ( perhaps it always was from the very start ) by political cronies and "astroturf" shills, fake activists paid to subvert a real social movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its not surprising to see corporate interests stoop this this level, but it is really disturbing as to the future of this country if real social movements are being manipulated and subverted from the inside out and rendered completely impotent. Worse actually, since they leech real effort and energy from legitimate supporters and lead them against their initial cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Make no mistake, this isn't about black lives matter or any racial matter. This is about the impetus of public movements being completely leeched and dissuaded.

            People really need to look up Bernie Sanders, he is known for his pro-war and pro-Zionist views.
           </p>
           <p>
            He supported even supported the last genocide by the Israelis against the besieged people of Gaza. Let us not get tricked by this guy.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This relative silence on Israel-related issues, however, seems to have broken during and after the 2014 Gaza conflict, during which 72 Israelis and over 2,100 Palestinians were killed, the majority of them civilians. In an undated statement on his Senate website , Sanders decried “the Israeli attacks that killed hundreds of innocent people – including many women and children,” calling the bombings “disproportionate” and “completely unacceptable.”
             </p>
             <p>
              In mid-July 2014, Sanders was one of just 21 Senators not to co-sponsor a resolution expressing support for Israel in the conflict with Hamas. The resolution passed on July 17 by unanimous consent, meaning that no roll call vote was taken on the measure.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the video of the August 2014 town hall, recorded while the conflict was still ongoing, Sanders was more equivocal than in the statement now on his website. While asserting that Israel had “overreacted,” and that the bombing of UN facilities was “terribly, terribly wrong,” he also noted that Hamas was launching rockets from populated areas.
             </p>
             <p>
              “This is a very depressing and difficult issue,” Sanders said at the town hall. “This has gone on for 60 bloody years.”
             </p>

             There are other sources saying that Bernie denounced Israeli actions. What are your sources?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Months after the conflict, in February 2015, Sanders was the first Senator to announce that he would skip Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to a joint session of Congress. “[Netanyahu] doesn’t have the right to inject himself into an American political discussion by being the speaker before a joint session of Congress to criticize the United States,” Sanders said on CNN.

             For real. I hate this idea that one candidate; one good leader or captain of a ship can save us. They're all corrupt. The US voting system is awful. We don't need representatives. We have the technology. We need smaller States and true voting on all key issues.

            I don't know if I should be scared or excited that I actually agree with the people in conspiracy. Glad to see some people get it. Of COURSE Hilary Clinton's political machine is behind this. Who else would be? Why wouldn't the BLM group disrupt Hilary Clinton's rallies? She is the front runner, she is the one getting all the attention, she is the one(right now anyway) leading in polls. I mean I don't KNOW for sure she is behind this, but I really don't see how it could be anyone else....

            Bernie wants to be approachable but he also needs to think of the bigger picture. It's obvious that people are now being paid to disrupt Bernie, because only a complete imbecile would see Bernie as a threat to African Americans.

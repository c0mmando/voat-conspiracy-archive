<p>Tony, the child\'s alternate personality, was invented, as his mother explained, shortly after his father dislocated his shoulder. Tony is the child\'s way of coping with the trauma, much like Sybil\'s many alternate personalities from her mother sexually molesting her as a young girl, or <strong>Alice</strong> in Alice and Wonderland coping with rape. When the child is in the fourth dimension of the hotel, Tony takes over in his \'absence.\' When asked where Tony lives, the boy says he lives in his stomach, which is important because this is the location of your Solar chakra. This is also why Rudolph Hess and Hitler were vegans (you are what you eat... more on that later). </p>
<p>It is well known that children experience \'paranormal\' activity/contact at a much higher rate than adults, and this traumatic experience extrapolated his \'power\' of The Shining at an extremely young age, which was why the Chef was concerned. The Chef knew that his heightened ability at a young age would be a concern in the hotel, because he would have trouble handing the site, which was built on an Indian burial ground. Also, calling it \'The Shining\' is also a reference to his \'solar\' powers (much like the astronaut in 2001, who becomes a <strong>Sonnen</strong>mensch(Superman)/Hero after sacrificing himself, and is rewarded by ascending into the fourth dimension [why \'he\' can\'t see him in the room but can feel his presence] and seeing how he benefited himself in the other dimensions, which he can now see into because he was reborn a star, becoming eternal). The Shining is also a reference to the third eye, which gives the ability to contact fourth dimensional powers (i.e UFOs, ETs, those who operate outside of our concept of time and space). You can see the boy\'s red mark on his forehead between his eyes when he\'s <em>out  there</em> laying on the bed later in the movie. This is why the Egyptians worshiped Horus/RA, which is often manifested in hieroglyphics as a Sun coming from their foreheads, as well as <em>spirals</em> coming out of their foreheads (as antennas). This is also part of the meaning of the Black Sun, which is visualized during meditation to activate one\'s pineal gland. </p>
<p>The Chef experienced his trauma at a much later age, which is why his powers aren\'t as intense as the boy. You can tell this because he wears his watch backward when he calls his other black friend in Denver (who also wears it backward). I assume this is a reference to them both being buddies from Vietnam, since wearing a watch this way is primarily a jarhead thing to do (or tacticool chad millennial now).</p>
<p>The reason the boy randomly asks what cannibalism is on his way to the hotel is because its a hint at what (((they))) do. They traumatize the children, much like the boy (see worldcorpo, A Clockwork OrangeMKULTRA), extrapolating &amp; exploiting their powers, and then eat them. The guy being a Chef is just another hint at that.</p>
<p><strong>You are what you eat</strong></p>
<p>Its their way of <em>consuming</em> their powers. Skippy and Alice are their alternate personalities who take over when they\'re not <em>here</em>, but <em>there</em> in the fourth dimension, trying to contact beings who can aid them because they\'re in the future, present, and past all at once (Why Jack has been writing the same sentence a million times in purgatory, but also hasn\'t died yet... see Donnie Darko for more on this phenomenon). Its also why John Podesta\'s emails seemed so obsessed with UFOs/Zero Point Energy. </p>
<p>Enough Essay writing for now. But A Clockwork Orange, 2001, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut really have to be viewed as a series like Lord of the Rings, telling a story with the same theme over four completely different genres; in other words - through <em>art</em>, which explains a lot itself (see Jimmy Comet).</p>
<p><sup>bonus: the cat picture in the beginning when the boy is on the bed is the  same one that is in the Rugrats episode where the babies get lost in the Museum; where after putting on the African masks, which were worn by <strong>cannibals</strong>, they put on the same cat/dragon costume.</sup></p>',

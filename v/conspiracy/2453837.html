            Tolkien knew A LOT and despite hearing this and that about LOTR, it took me about 15 years of research just to realize how much Tolkien knew. LOTR isnâ€™t our future. LOTR is a fictionalized version of real medieval history that was covered over by Catholic scribes who forged fake histories when most people were illiterate peasants. Tolkien had special access to British archives off limits to most others.

             Btw, I believe Mordor represents the Ottoman presence in the Balkans, though our popular conception of what that empire was like is probably enormously distorted and relates somehow to Tartars and Mongols. Elves seem to represent the Nordic race and Hobbits the Pict-like races that inhabited Western Europe (Scotland, Aquitaine, Gascony, etc) before the Caucasian arrived. There is some resemblance between middle earth and Europe in that way.

            The One Ring is an analogy...its like a new form of technology like the computer or the atom bomb, the one ring is like the Silk road of its time, Globalism, Communism, mohammedanism and socialism, facebook/reddit, the Internet, Printed Media, Internationalism

            Alwaleed bin Talal from Saudi prince to king of Twitter, Citgroup and Hollyweird Global Jewish Royal Euro movies?   Forbes listed Al-Waleed as the 45th richest man in the world, with an estimated net worth of $18.7 billion.

            On November 2017 he and other prominent Saudis (including fellow billionaires were arrested in a purge characterized as an anti-corruption drive. The allegations against him include money laundering, bribery, and extorting officials. Some of the detainees have been in the Ritz Carlton Riad since then

            In the Greatest War Ever Fought against Morgoth a Commie Fascist Slaver, Countless slaves were freed from Morgoth's dungeons after his defeat. The wreckage of the war was immense indeed; most of the land west of the Ered Luin, as well as a large part of the central part of the mountains, was laid waste and soon after sank beneath the waves. The two great Dwarf cities of Nogrod and Belegost were also ruined, forcing their populaces to flee. Most of the Elves went to the West, while others went East. The Valar raised up the island of NÃºmenor in the Western Sea as a new home for the Edain. Morgoth's defeat here was not total, however; his chief lieutenant Sauron, survived, and surrendered to the Valar in fear of them. When ordered to return to Valinor, Sauron instead fled and hid deep in Middle-earth, where he would later rise once more to carry on the will of his master. The terrible destruction of the War of Wrath convinced the Valar to avoid direct intervention in Middle-earth for the sake of Men and Elves. As a result, Sauron would rise to great power and prove a devastating opponent for the free peoples there for the next two Ages.

            Tolkien did not specifically name any particular philosophy or religion like Communism or islam that may have 'historically inspired' his folklore but you can interpret it yourself
These culturally similarities are not just stereotypes from Tolkienâ€™s work, but in every Dwarf, vampire, Elf book in all Dungeons and Dragons, all Fantasy myth fiction all the way through modern video games like World Of Warcraft and Hearthstone. commonly occurring pop fantasy racesâ€”elves, dwarves, trolls/orcs, even humansâ€”have their roots in European mythology. From the dwarves and elves of Nordic poetry to Scandinaviaâ€™s trolls, the basic shape and cultural texture of many of these beings can be linked directly to ancient folklore. But it wasnâ€™t until Tolkienâ€™s works, which were heavily inspired by such myths, that the tropes we are familiar with today really fell into place.
           </p>
           <p>
            on these islamo or invader attack
I QUOTE myself : .....
indeed # Not all Orcs ...some Orcs and Goblins do not become invaders nor do they illegally enter attack terrorize nor are fundamentalist murderers they just want to do Orc things, they just want to do Goblin things and do not want to attack the Shire they just live in Orc Lands! Just go back to the original texts, drawings, scripts, books and movies...ask Baggins, Frodo, the Ring! Precious! The Easterlings also known as Swarthy Men, were primitive tribes of Men who roamed Middle-earth in the First Age they have a culture that connects with Haradim. Ancestors of the Haradrim were Men who awoke in the First Age, but stayed to the East of Middle-earth, not joining the migration of the Edain to the West. They eventually settled in Harad, where the Sun is fierce and there are no clouds. It is possible that they were relatives of the Swarthy Men who went to Beleriand after the Edain. While the Easterlings and the Haradrim are dark-skinned people in the service of the Enemy, the Woses are primitive, small, and alien compared to other peoples their chief Ghan-buri-Ghan only wears a grass skirt yet they are valuable allies. In the Second Age Sauron escaped the judgment of the Valar and continued his former master's work, turning the Men of the East and South to evil and dominating them. Under the authority of the Dark Lord, many towns and walls of stone were built, and those under his influence became numerous and armed with iron. To these men, Sauron was feared as a king and god. Humans under the domain of the Enemy worship Melkor as God, denying the existence of Eru IlÃºvatar, Sauron told the NÃºmenÃ³reans that IlÃºvatar is a lie told by the Valar to keep the NÃºmenÃ³reans from power. Sauron, since the downfall of Melkor has had himself worshiped as a god by his subjects, it is unknown if other dark entities such as Saruman are also worshiped as deities in Melkorism. Within the ranks of Orcs as the Uruk-hai held themselves as superior to the common Orcs, whom they called snaga (slave). After the allied attack on Muammar Orc Leader Gaddafi and the destruction of the Orc state there has been a massive wave of 'migration' of 'refugee' Orcs to Rohan, Gondor and Arnor...and of course many citizens have been murdered and splatted by Orc Chariots of Peace and Orc bombs-of-peace and Orc knives of peace. after the election of a New Leader for the Greatest Free Nation the Orange Don Chief had decided to Build A Wall and any Orc nations who terrorized and screamed 'Death to the Great Nation' and Death to the West would be banned from Entering the Great Nation, Goblins would also be banned from entering. Toxic Regressive globalist Left types in the Great Nation of course cried 'Racism'...
           </p>
           <p>
            The 'Shire' and its Wine drinking Hobbits may actually be rural England, but also connect to the old cultures of Europe, the Scots, Italians, some villages in Denmark, or along the US Appalachian trail, Newfoundland Canada, Slavic Balkan types...people who the West sometimes seen as troublesome but could be great allies
           </p>
           <p>
            Arabian, or North African words feature in his books Semitic obviously
           </p>
           <p>
            Who are the Elf, are they Germanic, Welsh or from Finland? Tolkien would create languages first, then write cultures and histories to speak them, often taking inspiration from the sound of an existing language. In the case of the ever-present Elvish languages in his works, Tolkien took inspiration from Finnish and Welsh
Others from far-off lands are the Easterlings, or Asiatics, Southrons, or Semites, and Haradrim or Africans. Perhaps in the books it is that "men are men..." just like "Elves are Elves," placing no distinction between history and cultural connections?
           </p>
           <p>
            But what do you want, some even think that Middle Earth is supposed to be New Zealand...this is more a modern movie interpretation...people can say its New Zealand but that is despite Tolkien saying quite often that it's Europe
           </p>
           <p>
            Tolkien paints a mostly positive picture of the dwarves in his books he said that "few Dwarves ever served the enemy willingly", contrary to the tales of Men and elsewhere he made explicitly positive statements about the Jewish people. However, one of the weaknesses of the Dwarves was their greed for gold and other riches, amplified by the Seven Rings a stereotype of the Jewish usurer?

<p>a place very similar to Eastern State Penitentiary in Austria, with very similar isolation cells, said to have been a prison for soldiers known as the Narrenturm </p>

           The Narrenturm was built in Vienna about, roughly,  the same time that Eastern State Penitentiary
          </p>
          <p>
           was built , and Benjamin Franklin had dealings with its builder  Emperor Joseph II. He played chess with him when visiting him in Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
           Which could have been the genesis of Franklin's  idea to build Eastern State Penitentiary
          </p>
          <p>
           along similar lines.
          </p>
          <p>
           The implications then are that Eastern State Penitentiary may have intentionally imprisoned and tortured already-trained soldiers , for later use in suicide missions, and that the Germanic nations Germany/Austria were doing the same thing at the Narrenturm.
          </p>
          <p>
           So WW1 and WW2 may have been planned genocides , using suicidally-programmed individuals on
           <strong>
            both sides
           </strong>
           .
 Essentially guaranteeing the mutual destruction of both sides.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you find this interesting, could you help research this?  For example, can you find out whether Eastern State Penitentiary had an entire ward or wing to house 'criminals' from the military?

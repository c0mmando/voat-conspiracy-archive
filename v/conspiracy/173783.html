            I definitely agree that it is not an ideal situation. I would love it if we had specific criteria which any moderator could be expected to apply without the need to think and evaluate. I definitely think the rule can be reworded to be more precise, or a policy could be written which is more useful than "I know it when I see it", and I suspect it will be impossible to cover all instances of disruption through explicit definition.

            I did not see your edits until just now. You're free to go to another subverse which has a more permissive rule regarding racism. You're also welcome to help establish more clear wording in the rules or in our moderation policy document if you have any specific suggestions as far as wording goes. In the near future I'll be attempting to facilitate a community discussion on this issue, actually, to help make things a bit more clear cut if possible - as referenced in the currently

            on this subverse. I hope that you'll choose to participate.

            I'm not sure that this can be inferred from my comments. If it were inferred, it would imply that any person who happens to be (or poses as being) uncomfortable with any given discussion would be the metric by which a comment is removed or its poster admonished.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, in my evaluation it is an "I know it when I see it" sort of situation. Employing an empathizing exercise in one of the incidents I referenced helped me.

            It's one of those "I know it when I see it" kind of deals. I don't have a codified metric, since it hasn't happened enough to have developed one. In one of the two incidents I thought to myself, "if I were a member of the group this person is talking about, would I feel comfortable engaging in the discussion?"

            I would say that there are anti-semitic elements in our movement, but they are:
1. A sincere, but damaged or immature fringe... a very small proportion.
2. CoIntel, but here intentionally to make it seem like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they are here... not HERE, but they were on Reddit and Digg, and they are LOUD.

            The essence of Cointel was always to insert radical elements into a movement, to make them seem crazy or decrease their appeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're probably not sure how much capability Voat has to backtrack the IP's. While it is true that agents could use proxies, a good hacker could set up proxy traps (dummy nodes) and use a time series of access logs to triangulate the actual access locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd say that 50% of the speakers at DefCon could set up a trap good enough to catch all but the most sophisticated manipulators of data. Once they understand the threat surface, they'll be here in force... unless they find someone like Barnaby Jack is a friend of one of the founders... Aaron Schwartz wasn't HARDCORE-LEET, but he could have set up an IP Proxy trap network with ease. You probably could with about two months of research.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can't catch one person manipulating one vote, but if you have hundreds coming out of the same location, and you know the destination, it would only take a couple proxy traps and a few weeks to publish a list of all the manipulating IP's.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once you find an ACTUAL source, you can get very sneaky with Proxy traps, especially if they're using something algorithmically understood like Tor. I suspect there's no Barnaby on the Voat team, so the radical elements will be here, soon.

            you have noticed "lees joos" merely because most of the shills that where trying to make us look bad have either not come here yet, or are unable to post as much as they would like due to Voat having a system to alleviate that problem. I cannot supply physical evidence of this but Most of the real crazies (believing in lizard people, no moon landings or a flat earth etc) are paid shills trying to discredit legitimate people that question official mantra. JIDF for example is unable to spam here.  This is the reason i changed to Voat before fatgate. Love it here. (breaths deeply) that fresh conspiracy smell. mmmm smells like napalm in the morning. :)

            I have warned two users so far for racist remarks regarding Jewish people. That's all - and they've only been active since the recent influx from reddit along with the FPH stuff. I think in general the people on this sub are a bit more relaxed and sensible, want to focus on conspiracies objectively rather than make broad generalizations about an entire race of people.

            'Holocaust denial' is a misnomer, a contrived stigma designed to make you not question the official narrative. Have you ever looked into it at all? Because the official story has changed significantly over the years. Take this article for example (from today)
            <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/1508584/queen-visits-site-of-nazi-death-camp-horrors">
             http://news.sky.com/story/1508584/queen-visits-site-of-nazi-death-camp-horrors
            </a>
            The Queen visited Bergen-Belsen (not a death camp - a concentration camp), yes many people died there, but it wasn't an extermination camp (all of those are in eastern Europe). How could they possibly be so factually incorrect when it's their job to present us with facts? There lies the problem, the deeper you dig, the more you notice and there is definitely an agenda going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Have you seen how the Jewish people behave and treat others in their illegally gained land? Have you read the Talmud? Are you aware of there policy to keep a Jewish majority (this itself is racist and no other country on Earth does it), the way they've sterilized African women? A lot of Jews are openly racist, yet cry 'Antisemitism' whenever they're criticized. The ultimate get out of jail free card is 'Holocaust'. Epigenetic transmission of holocaust trauma, is where the children of holocaust victims 'inherit' the suffering of their parents (I shit you not)
            <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24029109">
             http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24029109
            </a>
            are we meant to believe this bullshit - we will never ever hear the last of it, even when the last victim is dead and gone they'll still be banging the holocaust drum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do people automatically assume that you are some kind of neo-nazi from stormfront or something if you ask these questions? It's no secret that there is a disproportionate amount of Jewish people in high ranking  positions across the globe.

            Well a lot of theories are based on Zionists, so unfortunately it will come up. However whats troubling for me is people cant see the difference between Zionism and Judaism, and instead of debating or discussing an issue just cry racism. Which is a BS excuse to not debate.

             i agree that the discussion has to happen on the difference between zionists and regular jews, but it feels as though there is a direct agenda to put the jews in a bad light, and outright deny the holocaust happened.  i feel as though a lot of times they use "zionist" simply to talk about jews and be "sneaky".

             it just seems like forced intolerance.  I'm not trying to say you can't say whatever you want to say but it just seems to be gamed to promote racist right-wing agendas

              Always remember that the prime strategy of Cointel is to pretend to be the PLAUSIBLE fringe of any group... slightly more aggressive, slightly more radical, with more typically bigoted insights. When you think about it... isn't that how YOU would take down a movement?
             </p>
             <p>
              Take someone's side, but conflate the rationale and the specifics to seem like a raging moron.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whereas you or I would say that there is an over-representation of Jews, statistically, in a lot of areas... and the control of any influence over the affairs of a nation or group should be regarded with much scrutiny... the CoIntel will say, "Jews CONTROL EVERYTHING. Jews OWN AMERICA."
             </p>
             <p>
              We might say, "For political reasons, it appears that a lot of Soviet Propaganda about the Nazis was taken with less scrutiny than justice deserves."
             </p>
             <p>
              They will say, "The holocaust never happened! Jews Financed Hitler!"

               this is exactly the kind of discussion I was trying to have.  I am curious if it is actually cointel trying to discredit, or is it racist orgs trying to recruit?  it seems so forced over there and over here it seems like we can have a logical conversation about what really is happening.  is it JIDF? is it Stormfront? is it conspiritard trying to make the conspiracy theorists look like fools "for the lulz"?

                Well... I don't think it's mostly "for the lulz". The reason is that I used to be a little shithead troll, back in my teens. I understand what people get from trolling, but as an authentic little dickhead troll, I acted WAY differently than these pros.

                I actually got my mind changed by an anti-troll, and that's why I stopped trolling. I used to be a dickhead about Christianity, mostly =P. I was petulant and smug... but I don't see much "teenage dickhead" tone to their discussions. I'm 90% certain that someone's gettin paid =P I just don't know by whom... but I only fear foreign intelligence services.

                I understand why JTRIG and JSOC would have an interest in tanking stuff like

              keep in mind it can be used as tool by zionists to make anti-zionists appear antisemite, in fact it could be the source of most of the antisemite content for all we know...

              I always thought that the zionists/Israel apologists benefitted most from the the confusion.

              one example.

              this is the argument that is always used to avoid talking about those issues though, as soon as some one mentions Zionism or Zionists, within an hour or so some one tries to make the argument all about the Jewish people or the Jewish religion instead of Zionism as a political movement/party just to derail the conversation.
             </p>
             <p>
              the problem with Zionist is that they always do this, and try to re-frame the discussion as anti-semetic when it had nothing to do with the damn religion in the first place. it pisses me off when people try to call me a racist or anti-semite when i criticize isreal your race means as much to me as the color of your shirt and your religion is about as meaningful to me as your favorite hockey team but what is being done in the name of all this crap as a political/governmental body is down right evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              its like saying im anti-christian/white for disliking bush and republican policies, its just down right ridiculous

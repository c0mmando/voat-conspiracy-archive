<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/12gye2/dae_remember_the_1989_loma_prieta_earthquake_in/">From a post I made</a> a few years back:</p>
<p>These ultra-low frequency waves may be the signature of some sort of <em>technology</em> being used, with clearly weaponized implications. </p>
<p>It has been alleged that the Soviets and the US engaged in covert seismic testing/earthquake warfare, particularly in the 1980s.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Armenian_earthquake">the 1988 Armenian earthquake</a> has been <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/55599812/Stanislav-Lunev-on-Russian-earthquake-weapon-and-secret-war-plans">attributed</a> to Soviet testing of seismic weapons. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/analysis/history.htm">In 1982</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soviet official Lysenko of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. stated publicly that, should nuclear disarmament fail, the Soviets would quickly introduce new weapons more powerful than nuclear arms, and these weapons would not be verifiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cheniere.org/books/analysis/history.htm">This is an excellent overview</a> of the history of these &quot;scalar&quot; weapons...the 1986 Challenger disaster is also attributed to Soviet EM weaponry by the author.</p>
<p>As for the USA and USSR being the particular warring factions in this scenario, I really can\'t comment much, but the hypothesis doesn\'t necessarily rely on identifying <em>who</em> caused the events, just that they were done deliberately.</p>
<p>This brings us to the \'89 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Loma_Prieta_earthquake">Loma Prieta</a> earthquake. Not only were electromagnetic anomalies indeed recorded before the quake, but this particular earthquake is often cited as being the prime example for such readings, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">2010 earthquake in Haiti.</a> This fact is even mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low_frequency">on the Wikipedia page for Ultra-low frequency</a>.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/haitian-catastrophe-raises-spectre-of-earthquake-weapon">much has been written</a> on the theory that the Haiti quake was artificially induced, there has been <a href="http://www.itwillpass.com/nwo_weather_altering_2.shtml">less discussion</a> about the 1989 quake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 12, 1989, sensors called magnetometers, (at Corralitos, near Monterrey Bay, California) detected unusual ULF (between 0.01 Hz and 10 Hz--the lowest ELF frequencies) radio signals, which grew 30 times stronger October 5, and then weakened somewhat. </p>
<p>At 2:00pm on October 17, the signals grew so strong that they went off of the sensor\'s scales. Three hours later, the San Francisco Bay area shook violently as the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake killed more than 60 people and injured 3800 others. </p>
<p>The catastrophic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_Northridge_earthquake">January 17, 1994 Los Angeles earthquake</a> was also preceded by mysterious radio signals. Some observers in Los Angeles reported hearing two loud &quot;sonic booms&quot; (which are typical symptoms of Soviet Tesla weapons usage) immediately before the earthquake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the mention of the &quot;Soviet&quot; theory in this context as well...an it was only a matter of time before &quot;HAARP&quot; and &quot;Tesla&quot; were invoked as well.</p>
<p>Although some have attempted to dismiss these ULF readings as a &quot;malfunction,&quot; <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/access_denied">the evidence does support this theory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, W.H. Campbell has claimed that the existence of a ULF precursor signal to the Loma Prieta earthquake &quot;is very likely false&quot;. Campbell argues that the reported &quot;precursor&quot; was not of local origin but was recorded throughout the western US and was therefore a solar-terrestrial disturbance; and that the extreme amplitudes reported by Fraser-Smith must have been due to an instrumental malfunction. </p>
<p>Because of the importance of the Loma Prieta ULF-EM signal to earthquake-prediction studies, we have critically examined the Campbell and the Thomas et al. claims about the veracity of the signal. We have duplicated much of the Campbell and the Thomas et al. methodologies, but we are extending our comparison over two years of observations including time periods significantly before and after the Loma Prieta earthquake. </p>
<p>Even a simple visual comparison between very long time series from Fresno and Corralitos shows that the single instrumental gain change postulated by Campbell and by Thomas et al. does not suffice to explain the data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Soviets and Americans are by no means the only factions that potentially have access to this weaponry. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_earthquake">The Great Hanshin or Kobe earthquake</a> in Japan in 1995 was &quot;predicted&quot; by the infamous AUM leader <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoko_Asahara">Shoko Asahara</a> just weeks before it hit. </p>
<p>AUM\'s science minister, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Murai">Hideo Murai</a> publicly declared after the earthquake that it was the result of a foreign attack using exotic technology. Weeks later, and during a live TV broadcast on that very subject, Murai was stabbed to death repeatedly in front of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>How would a bizarre Japanese cult know about earthquake technology? </p>
<p>Here\'s a post of mine that goes into more detail on that subject: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/axolotl_peyotl/comments/1kr2xm/aum_shinrikyo_japanese_cults_tesla/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=axolotl_peyotl">Aum Shinrikyo: Japanese Cults, Tesla Electromagnetic Weapons, Earthquake Attacks and an Unexplained Explosion in the Australian Outback</a></p>
<p>Why is this all relevant today? If indeed such technology is feasible, then we need to be extra vigilant when it comes to these tell-tale signs <em>before</em> these earthquakes occur. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1388789/Japan-earthquake-Atmosphere-epicentre-heated-rapidly-days-disaster.html">the atmosphere above the epicenter of the 2011 earthquake in Japan heated up <em>rapidly</em> in the days before it occured</a>.</p>
<p>And here we are, 28 years after the Loma Prieta earthquake, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76qsqe/evidence_of_energy_weaponry_causing_california/">with <em>extremely</em> unusual fires</a> devastating Northern California, and a two days before 10 million people take place <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/76cb9e/10_million_californians_to_take_part_in_worlds/">in the world\'s largest earthquake drill</a>.</p>
<p>Has WWIII already started (or are we on number IV by now)? </p>
<p>Although &quot;HAARP&quot; and the Soviet &quot;Woodpecker&quot; weapon systems seem to be the scapegoat for a lot of this activity, it\'s entirely possible that this type of technology may have been around long before HAARP even existed.</p>
<p>Did Tesla <em>really</em> do what he claimed...did he accidentally, or deliberately, cause the <a href="http://www.teslasociety.com/tunguska.htm">1908 Tunguska Explosion?</a></p>

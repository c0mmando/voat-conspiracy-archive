<p>Remember how the MSM kept assuring you Clinton was already the winner? Well, it\'s because they severely modify pre-election polls, here is how they butchered Jill Stein\'s poll numbers: <a href="https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/is-the-corporate-media-reporting-jill-steins-true-polling-numbers/">https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2016/09/18/is-the-corporate-media-reporting-jill-steins-true-polling-numbers/</a> and already had rigged the voting machines to &quot;change&quot; your Trump or Johnson vote into a Clinton vote while keeping the margins very close. That\'s why some states were ridiculously close this year. But the machines are set to not exceed the total amount of votes per state for the pre-determined President, and in a worst case scenario they allow the opponent to win if that candidate receives an unexcepetedly large turnout. Clinton was the pre-determined President for 2016, but the spooks did not take into account the massive amounts of Trump voters who turned out to vote for him. This is the only reason Trump won. Ever wonder why Gary only got 3.2%? They simply change third party votes into a Clinton vote.

<p>As most of you know, Jill Stein is in the process of checking for votes that were supposed to be hers, but were changed into a Clinton vote instead. She seems like she has no idea what she is doing and is making a fool of herself, and is using some funds that were probably not exactly legal to acquire. Clinton at first was completely against the recount, but after Hilary found out she was serious, Hilary wasted no time dispatching a team of IT guys (I am guessing to hide the evidence, as this is the first time a candidate has attempted to preform this particular type of audit) I think that the Libertarian Party should probably preform our own recounts, especially were we were supposed to have preformed better then the government reported. We are a larger party and we should be able to audit more states due to our parties larger infrastructure.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind Gary received at least 6%-8% of the vote. And Jill 2%-5%.</p>',

            Its especially interesting because exit polls were virtually non existant this year.  They justified it by pointing out how "wrong" exit polls were in the last 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could be either the long game, or they felt exposed.  Either exit polls failed by design in order to remove them from the dialogue, or exit polls were designed to fail so that no one could judge elections by the most reliable source available...the voters themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, they are in control.

             Yes, since the government does not release a public list with your name and who you voted for, the only way to keep tabs on the rigged machines is to probably have volunteers at at every polling location.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was just reading the unlimited ways to rig electronic voting machines, they serve one purpose: allow TBTB to choose who they want in power.

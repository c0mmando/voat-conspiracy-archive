Band\'s lifelong manager and lifelong friend of Adam Levine died unexpectedly of a heart thing. This was Jonah Hill (the actor\'s) brother. And then the music video itself and the timing of release.

<p>Also the guy that made the music video joked about having joined the illuminati. It is a very weird video. watch it on mute so you don\'t get MK Ultra\'d like Paddock ;) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wiio4KoGe8YouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wiio4KoGe8YouTube</a></p>
<p>Some music can be used by the CIA to trigger individuals who are MK Ultra\'d. Stephen Paddock and the other members and attackers were MK Ultra\'d. This music video was hi trigger, Two days before the shooting Boris Johnson was recorded reciting the Road To Mandalay, a Rudyard Kipliing poem: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple">https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple</a></p>
<p>it was a warning.</p>
<p>Basically, there\'s an entire industry for creating mass terror events with multiple interested parties such as occultists who are into the sacrifice thing as well as political factions which use such events to push any number of agendas as well as intelligence groups who like to set up operations to happen in the shadow of these events in order to &quot;ride the coverup&quot; while adding another level of rational deniability. Since everyone benefits, the normalfag sheep can\'t cognitively grasp the fact that the &quot;bad guy&quot; is truly a system rather than the stock scapegoats pushed in the media. Even if they stray from official narratives just a bit, the initial tangle of disinformation and the impenetrable history of the origins of the system make it impossible for most to stop from getting hung up on one aspect of the answer and fail to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>What I heard is that the old guard which Kashoggi was tight with had like Bin Talal and PRINCE BANDAR.</p>
<p>Remember Bandar? The one so close with the Bush family he was called &quot;Bandar Bush&quot;... yea supposedly that is who the CIA wanted to run KSA, not MBS.</p>
<p>I wonder how much of bin Talal\'s assets MBS seized during the arrest. Bin Talal had heavy investments in Silicon Valley tech, particularly Twitter. In March, MBS went on a trip to Silicon Valley to meet with the major players (Apple, YouTube, etc.). Was he checking in on his newly seized investments? The shooting at YouTube in March by that Iranian chick was the same day that YouTube was having a special &quot;party&quot;, and likely MBS was there at the time. Another hit attempt?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/10/20/business/tech/khashoggi-crisis-puts-saudi-ties-silicon-valley-businesses-spotlight/#.XBWQ2c1MHIU">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/10/20/business/tech/khashoggi-crisis-puts-saudi-ties-silicon-valley-businesses-spotlight/#.XBWQ2c1MHIU</a></p>
<p>Yea as far fetched as it may seem there is an MBS connection with both these events.</p>
<p>uh oh, does that mean Nasim was CIA too? or MK Ultra\'d?</p>
<p>Francho Bradley and Adrianne Jennings connected to MBS and government agencies and Parkland via march for our lives. Hogg and his dad were involved in the Francho and Adrianne thing in Massachusetts. Hogg wouldn\'t be killed but thousands others were going to be. Florida players connected to Massachusetts, Francho Bradly, Adrianne Jennings, march for our lives, MBS.</p>
<p>whats more, if our government knows of this Saudi plot, there can be no other answer than they are complicit.</p>
<p>that makes me far more uncomfortable with Kushner and Trump in the white house</p>
<p>ice spell to keep you all asleep. water freezes at 32F he killed from the 32nd floor, he was feeding saturn to keep you all under control. blood = power.</p>
<p>Put Stephen Craig Paddocks full name in Jewish Gematria.</p>
<p>Interesting article. I didn\'t put Khashoggi and Silicon Valley together. Also interesting is that Khashoggi penned an article critical of Riyadh and MBS in the Washington Post on September 18, 2017, two weeks before Vegas. He went into exile from Saudi Arabia to the US a few months prior. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/09/18/saudi-arabia-wasnt-always-this-repressive-now-its-unbearable/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2017/09/18/saudi-arabia-wasnt-always-this-repressive-now-its-unbearable/</a> The date of his death is suspect too. October 2, 2018, almost exactly a year to the day after the October 1, 2017 Vegas massacre. Maybe with the Istanbul / Vegas time difference, it was almost within a year and a couple hours. Was it meant to be an anniversary assassination?</p>
<p>Anyone else notice Mandalay Bay is the same shape as a fidget spinner and the shooting happened the same year fidget spinners became popular?</p>
<p>i honestly don\'t know who is aligned with whom. i do know that the relationship between Kushner and MBS is too close for comfort, and i do know the administration\'s unwillingness to hold SA accountable for the two acts can only come from the highest echelon of government.</p>
<p>one of those things being so is excusable, but both at the same time is untenable</p>
<p>Democrats and the deep state staged this and set up the arms dealer as the patsy. This has CIA written all over it. With their past plans coming public to attack US citizens as false flag operations, it\'s not hard to believe. Operation northwoods and gladio.</p>
<p>People died in Florida at that school. The kikes that are in the Gov. pushed their little kike kids to get this other kid to shoot up the school. It took the ugly cunt what 3-4 years and he finally did it. I wonder what award they gave that cunt after getting him to snap. I wish he would have shot that bitch right in the nose. She has a wonderful commie kike CIA career ahead of her until she\'s dead...</p>
<p>Not enough people draw parallels between the MGM Grand Fire and the Route 91 Harvest attack. Both locations were owned by MGM with a famous Democrat CEO.</p>

            Review of official reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            These reports were never really intended to be read. In the preliminary report Rodriguez is misspelled with a q; that spelling error is never fixed. Numerous other spelling errors and vague language fill the document. The corrections just clarify questionable parts of the story. In the preliminary report Engineer Schuck locked the elevator. In the final report the elevator was locked at police request. The preliminary report note over an hour between the last shots and the SWAT breach, in the final report that is explained as the shift from active shooter to barricaded subject protocols.
           </p>
           <p>
            The final report addresses the questions of conspiracy and motive. A broader conspiracy is dismissed out of hand. Motive is never explicitly stated, but the statements of Paddock’s family imply a standard lone nut motive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephen Paddock seemed prepared to host a meeting. He prepared an artificial flower display. He had a second refrigerator sent to the primary room. He also had booked an adjacent room. 13 minutes passed between the first shots and no detectable heat signature in the main room. During this time Paddock fired over 1,000 rounds from multiple rifles, in multiple rooms, at at least 3 separate targets (concert, fuel tanks, and hall), drilled holes, and subsequently lie dead for an hour before SWAT entered the scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            Campos and Schuck are both odd characters. Security Officer Campos is the first one shot, but with such a superficial wound that he suspects an air rifle. No air rifle is ever found. Campos reported the exact floor and room where the shooter was, but despite that SWAT checked several other floors first. Campos left the country immediately after the shooting to attend a preplanned vacation to Mexico with his father. Law enforcement authorized this vacation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Engineer Schuck was dispatched to remove the “L” bracket which blocked the stairway access to the 32nd floor from below. Upon arriving Schuck took fire and sought cover in an alcove. Schuck remained on the floor through the explosive breaches and assists with the evacuation of guests. Shuck stated he could have left earlier, but wanted to help.
           </p>
           <p>
            SWAT Officer Sean O’Donnell was in a lot of places making a lot of decisions. He is the only named officer who approached the 32nd floor from above. The main SWAT element moved from the 29th floor up slowly clearing every room on their way up. He took a service elevator from the top floor to the 32nd floor where he met the rest of the strike team. He decided to change procedure from active shooter to barricaded subject. He saw the camera on the food cart and decided on the explosive breach. He was the first to see Paddock’s body. He was also negligently discharged his weapon in the stack to breach the second room. Prior to his negligent discharge he placed his weapon on burst mode so it fired 3 rounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are inconsistent reports regarding the approach to Paddock’s room. Notably armed casino security officers responded almost immediately to the 32nd floor to assist Campos. 2 LVMPD officers also arrived during the shooting. Neither of these groups attempted to enter the room or stop the shooting in progress. They were instead tasked with evacuating the rest of the floor, which may have continued or commenced after the explosive breach.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are several key omissions in the report.
           </p>
           <p>
            A witness reported seeing Paddock with an unnamed Asian female prior to the shooting. She was described as between 4’11” and 5’2” with no description of her age or height. When pressed for details the witness shrugged and said she looked Asian. No photos of her were mentioned despite pervasive CCTV.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paddock had 4 cell phones and a note to “unplug phones”. 3 of those phones warranted paragraphs about how many contacts they had etc. 1 phone, (310) 357-3358, received zero elaboration. Also the note to “unplug phones” is never shown. Comparing handwriting to his bullet drop notepad could be interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upper floors. It never occurs to SWAT breaching the “L” bracket from below that they could enter the floor from above. The possibility of any additional persons escaping to higher floors is never considered. 1 hour passed between the end of a heat signature and SWAT’s breach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heat detection. At 2218 there were no more heat signatures detected in 32-135. There is no mention of any heat signatures in 32-134.
           </p>
           <p>
            7 bodies were “placed” outside of the venue. Who placed them? 31 people died at the venue itself, most in a cluster easily observed from 32-135. 4 of those 31 died at a medical tent. 20 more died in area hospitals. 7 were found dead in adjacent areas which the reports note as being placed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reflections:
           </p>
           <p>
            While these reports were obviously part of a coverup there is useful information buried inside. Paddock was clearly prepared to host a meeting. There was plenty of time to escape upward. Campos, Schuck, and O’Donnell were key figures in the action considering they all made key decisions, witnessed important actions, and provided plausible answers to weird issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            I strongly suspect Stephen Paddock was set up. The bullet drop math on the notepad is never compared to the “unplug phones” note. His google searches are basically “how do I do a big shooting” which seem a little convenient. Also the contents of his laptop and 4th phone are completely ignored, but we’re given a juicy tidbit about his illegal pornography collection. Paddock had few friends, strong opinions, and shunned publicity. His family all provided that he was probably insane, with Eric Paddock providing the most animated testimony.
           </p>
           <p>
            As with many official coverups the official report doesn’t even stand up against itself.
           </p>

            Oh and Brian Hodge was in 32134 which was his and Paddocks room and he has a past with Marilou Danley in Aus working at a casino if she was in Philippines she was hanging around casinos with MILF and ISIS plus here facebook had terror ties and she's an FBI informant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Leland Ye, Feinstein, and Paddock were partners i'm sure. Gun running to and from South East Asia. There's plenty of radical criminal and terrorist groups in SEA. And the guy who was going to shoot from the Mandalay Bay in 2014 is connected too. My guess is FBI nailed Ye, flipped Marilou, and busted the shooter who Paddock and Ye sold to, Paddock cut a deal to stay out of prison in 2015 and became a asset. September 25 - October 2 2017 the drill was just a cover for what was about to happen and the FBI/ATF/FEMA/DHS/DOD and LVPD asked for permission from the FAA to fly in restricted air space around the Mandalay Bay, Vegas strip, and Route91 so police and federal helicopters were airbourne on that night and with shooters with guns from the LVPD and federal agencies who were not involved in a training exercise they said it was a special operation which means this was bigger than a gun sting and they planned on firing their weapons. 30 - 40 FBI must have checked in to the Mandalay Bay on September 25 the day Timothy J Bates planned to shoot up the white house and kill Trump and the day Paddock checked in on. Some one was in Paddocks room and driving his car at the same time. Hodge or Danley were the drivers. Danley was in the Flips Hodge was his right hand man.
           </p>

            The FBI let the gun buyers kill Paddock or got tied up or they turned it into a gun walk. The CIA was involved as always Jamal was Saudi and CIA. Maybe CIA sabotaged a gun walk. NBC or MSNBC was staying in the Mandalay in Four Seasons that week so mockingbird media for planned narrative before a big event so planned lying and dis info for an op gone wrong that they and those involved knew would go wrong. I want you to think for a moment. The FBI and cops did fly helicopters in restricted airspace for a special operation involving Paddock and they did plan on using live hot weapons so this was not a gun walk. So we know Paddock was in the same shirt for 7 days and had to have either been dead on 1st for some time or killed right before the shooting. And then the helicopters went around shooting the people who killed Paddock or shooting with the people who killed Paddock.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scott Edminston and Timothy J Bates guns could've came from LV but who knows. Well some were walked. Nah i'm sure they got 'em from else where.
           </p>

            Francho and Adrianne were to kill MBS but it back fired. Or they were to shoot up march for our lives but it back fired. The FBI/CIA and FLPD made Nicholas go mad and do the shooting. Then the FBI broke into the NSA. Then the FBI/CIA wanted to mow down protesters in Massachusetts and end the 2A and kill people at the UN and MBS. And this is what tumblr is scared of along with everything.

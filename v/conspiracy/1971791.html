<p>Chemtrails, Sofia, the \'whiteness\' of the sun, \'nibiru\', and IR light</p>
<p>Nibiru is also know as the <strong>RED</strong> planet, the <strong>RED</strong> dragon, the <strong>RED</strong> kachina</p>
<p>Sofia is the worlds most powerful, publicly known infra<strong>RED</strong> telescope. It has been VERY active recently. Mauna Kea is the largest group based IRT.

<p>The sun, for those of us over 30, USED to appear more orange in the sky, where as now it appears more white... as if the visible color spectrum produced from its light has changed. </p>
<p>The ever present particulates that have been relentlessly sprayed  into the atmosphere are blocking the IR band (infrared bandwidth) of sunlight and \'any other sources\' from reaching the earth, and us.</p>
<p>Thus, consider that the purpose of the trails is not SRM, depopulation, nanotech/viral/germ tech, or laying a \'screen\' for holographic projection. Rather , the purpose is it hide the presence of an incoming body which only is visible in the infra<strong>RED</strong> bandwidth.</p>
<p>They don\'t have to block much:</p>
<p>&quot;Most infra<strong>RED</strong> light from celestial sources is absorbed by the Earth\'s atmosphere. <strong>Only a narrow window of near-infrared radiation (at wavelengths less than about 4 microns) reaches the Earth.</strong> Observations at these wavelengths requires that the infrared camera be cooled to hundreds of degrees below zero using a cryogen (such as liquid helium) and requires special solid-state infrared detectors (costing tens of thousands of dollars). Hence, it is impractical to consider a true infrared telescope for personal use.\'&quot; <a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ask_astronomer/faq/obs.shtml">http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ask_astronomer/faq/obs.shtml</a></p>
<p>So

<li>
<p>the sun has appeared to change color, going more white with less, red/orange</p>

<p>bollides, meteors, etc have been on the rise, as has the interest in \'asteroid defense\' and a new \'space branch\' of the US military was formed

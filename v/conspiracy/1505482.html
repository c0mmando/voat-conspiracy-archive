            The problem is that Trump is with group C, the Zionists. His appointees and AIPAC speech prove this and make his draining the swamp unlikely.

              Then use the word. Your theory is shit because Trump is apparently towing the Zionist line. Catch his AIPAC speech? Pandering about having a Jewish grandchild?

              I will be open minded and say there's a 10% chance Trump will drain the swamp while somehow not pissing off Israel.

            It could go either way honestly. None of it really makes much sense at all without more information.

            People are taking extraordinarily weird steps though... with the strange recount debate, extra votes in Detroit attributed to old machines (blamed on racism), the pulls of media and celebrities to flip electors...

            I think trump is big money, and that the big money in politics thinks he will make them even more money. Hillary was and is unelectable, and the DNC knew that well before they backed her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its the real reason Seth Rich was killed, not this wikileaks nonsense. Seth Rich was the one that had the voter expansion data. He was going to expose evidence that hillary had massive voter fraud supporting her, and would have made the whole thing visibly suspicious when the investigation came back that the DNC was endorsing a candidate that had no statistical chance of winning. Voter expansion data has proved very accurate in the past. The voter fraud was there to cover the asses of the DNC people, not to elect clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask yourself: why did trump have so many opponents, while hillary had essentially zero competition? And when bernie turned up, he got openly cheated out of his shot, and still kissed the ring. How did trump manage to get the nomination when there were a few half reasonable people running against him? I hate republicans and democrats, both the leadership and their zombie hordes, but I would have been less offended by Paul or Carson or Cruz, then either clinton or trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The powers that be want trump where he is right now. Its either because they think hes weak, or because he is an insider. I'm not sure if trump is a good or a bad thing, but time is gonna tell.

            Possible, sure.  Plausible?  Dunno, but it's a good theory and I'd like to see it be true.  Except for the part that no matter what one shadowy group or another runs everyone's lives...

              If he goes against The Federal Reserve/IRS I will be satisfied.  Those two bodies are what is keeping us from true freedom.  He needs to start printing Trumpbucks to pay off the 19 Trillion dollar debt which every American has to pay with their tax dollars.

              If he gets rid of the worst of the corruption and pedos and such, he will have done more than any other pres in my lifetime.  He could be a damn literal clown with red nose and all and I would overlook that to rid the gov of its vermin.

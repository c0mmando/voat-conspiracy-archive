            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Ridgers fired first what did they expect .. US Marshals who wanted to serve papers re the failure of Randy Weaver to attend court for the unlawful manufacture and sale of a sawed off shotgun, arrived at the Weaver household on Ruby Ridge near Naples, Idaho on August 21, 1992.
             </p>
             <p>
              Deputy US Marshal 42 yo William Francis Degan shot the Weaver's dog where upon 14 yo Samuel Weaver shot him dead, where after he was himself shot dead when the other Marshals returned fire. The next day on August 22, 1992 FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi fired two shots from 200 yards away.
             </p>
             <p>
              Conflicting accounts say Randy Weaver was hit in the arm and that family friend Kevin Harris was wounded, that Horiuchi's next bullet killed Vicki Weaver and her infant daughter precipitating an 11 day standoff. Harris and Randy Weaver later surrendered both were acquitted of murder, conspiracy and other Federal charges.
             </p>
             <p>
              Weaver was convicted of failing to appear for trial on the firearms charge, the Federal Government declined to prosecute Horiuchi.

               My own gut feeling is the whole issue has been contrived from beginning to end, and that there is a hoax / False Flag element at play here.

             Patriotism in America is all about standing firm against the Jews who attacked Sept. 11, 2001 who have infiltrated and subverted every level of the US Social Order, they are behind abortion genocide as well they caused both World Wars, the US Civil War and the French, American and Russian Revolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
             They are financing the farcical Trump impeachment, world wide civil unrest and racial strife as well they have deployed DEW Weaponry at home and abroad, as well they are behind the Militias.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a single man or woman of them had one ounce of patriotism they would demand the arrest, trial and execution of the Jews who did 911 in the first instance then every member of the FBI for spurning evidence against Jews, and the entire media and political lobbies that support the deception.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If Trump were to be impeached for spurning the evidence and allowing the Jewish perpetrators freedom ok .. except it is not like that at all the whole shermasco is to smokescreen Jewish wickedness.

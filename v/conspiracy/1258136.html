   Lately I've been having doubts about the alleged moon landing. After listening to this I'm basically convinced it never happened.

             <p>
              i think the more relevant question is; did the U.S. fake all of the moon landings and, if so, why
             </p>
             <p>
              my gut tells me that, if you're going to pull off a hoax of this scale, you're probably not going to repeat it multiple time
             </p>
             <p>
              from everything i've seen regarding evidence that we did not land on the moon, absolutely none of it is convincing - interesting, yes, but i've found no hard evidence in any of these documentaries or radio shows to back their claims
             </p>
             <p>
              as far as the van Allen radiation belt, i only have a very rudimentary knowledge of what it is - questions remain however; regardless of how radioactive it is, one could pass through it relatively safely as long as you get through it fast enough - just like passing your hand quickly through a flame
             </p>
             <p>
              is it radioactive?
             </p>
             <p>
              if so, is it radioactive enough to be dangerous to humans?
             </p>
             <p>
              if so, how thick it it and how much time did the vehicles spend in the belt at the velocity it was traveling?
             </p>
             <p>
              and how well were the vehicles protected against radiation?
             </p>
             <p>
              have any astronauts died of cancer and, if so, did this occur at a higher % than the general population?

               Interesting. I have had the opposite experience. I only recently went down this particular rabbit hole but every aspect of it to me seems to point towards the whole thing - every Apollo mission - being a complete hoax from every angle.
              </p>
              <p>
               Think of it, the only manned missions from any country have never traversed the radiation belt. I know enough about radiation to know that not only is it deadly to humans, the spacecraft would have to be outfitted with lead (the feasibility of this is seriously questionable considering how huge a moonbound rocket would have to be), but also even if they somehow made it through this huge obstacle, the solar radiation could have easily proven deadly while on the lunar surface. Not only this, but I personally doubt photographic film could even be used in this environment. And of course this leads into the question of the MANY anomalies in the photos themselves, of which many of those are devastating to the entire hoax, and ignored or insufficiently explained by NASA.
              </p>
              <p>
               As to other countries, it is my understanding that in Europe there is less belief in the official NASA story than there is in the United States, and Russia has indeed called our space program out many times. Think of it - NASA admitted in the last decade that the Van Allen belt is one of the main obstacles for a modern mission to Mars! But you're telling me we could do it 50 years ago??
              </p>
              <p>
               The space race was neck-and-neck, in fact Russia achieved the first satellite launch and first moon walk. Yet they never went to the moon themselves, not even with 50 years of additional R&amp;D?
              </p>
              <p>
               It's actually insulting that we're supposed to believe this stuff. In a conspiracy forum I would expect this to be discussed more.

               </blockquote>
               <p>
                i think you have a very wrong understanding of 'radiation' - you are being exposed to radiation at this very moment - you are being exposed to radiation every time you step outside - you are exposed to radiation constantly, 24/7/365 throughout your entire life
               </p>
               <p>
                there are many types of radiation and some of those types are very good for you (sunlight, for example)
               </p>
               <p>
                and again, even IF it is a deadly type of radiation, it makes no difference as long as you can get through it fast enough
               </p>
               <p>
                again, how THICK is the belt and how fast were the vehicles traveling?
               </p>
               <p>
                light a Bic lighter and hold your finger over it - you get burned - but quickly pass your finger through it and nothing happens
               </p>
               <p>
                you absolutely do not need a lead-lined spacecraft to pass through a radiation belt as long as you pass through it fast enough, or the radiation is not powerful enough to do you harm in the TIME it takes to move through it at the velocity you're traveling
               </p>

                assuming this statement is true, there is more that must be considered - what would a modern mission to Mars be like?  would the velocity of the spacecraft be less than the Apollo missions because of a potentially massively larger payload? if so, then yes, perhaps the van Allen belt could be more of a problem
               </p>
               <p>
                has the van Allen belt remained constant since the Apollo missions? i don't know. do you?

               <p>
                understand that i'm just playing a devils advocate here - i know full well that anything that comes out of the mouths of officials is too often utter bullshit, but on the other hand, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and i don't think you're considering some of the tougher evidence which support the conclusion that we did land on the moon
               </p>
               <p>
                i could very easily list multiple pieces of evidence which support that we never went to the moon which you haven't yet spoke of, and which are potentially far more convincing than what you have discussed thus far, but again, none of it is conclusive
               </p>
               <p>
                still, it is an interesting topic

            Did you bother to read anything I wrote about the history of LSD going back to 1600's for use in warfare.
Hoffman discovering LSD by mixing chemicals was an accident, not a synthesis, but the active substance LSD had been known for centurys, it common in dozens of plants, and many molds.

            It;s been a long road down all around. It takes 3 generations to redefine a culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think 150 years of indoctrination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think seacurd socities and their words of power. Think of the Grateful dead as a CIA, LSD dealing front.
           </p>
           <p>
            All baby-boomers should really know this, so that the genesis of law-less-ness is clear.
           </p>
           <p>
            They (them, the eternal others) made the flower power generation bloom and then WILT HARD.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now they're rich, seemingly secure and very afraid....
           </p>
           <p>
            So today's police state is a direct result of yesterday's CIA/FBI created free, flower power world.

            That's why in high-school I made my own, knowing that 40 micrograms was too much, I would start at 10 micrograms and work up until I got it just right, always personal use mind you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I tried the stuff at school a few times 'orange barrel' they called it, always had a bad trip, the plotter was worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            U know most stuff sold on street was Stychnine/Speed combo, the strychnine would make you hallucinate, and speed give the buzz, sort of same, but pure LSD under controlled amounts is fairly safe and interesting.

            As per "lame" , they didn't create just experimented with it, I believe the original intent was as a "truth serum" however they then went on to experiment in a wider feild which mostly ended up with the various agents using it and just generally having a good time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mk ultra is overblown,  however a lot of "dark" stuff went on re experiments with humans and some other races, a lot of that meant people were "mind wiped" to various amounts of success.

            Technically the CIA and Army didn't create LSD, they just learned how to abuse it.  Albert Hoffman discovered LSD and took his first trip on April 19th, 1943.  Once Hoffman discovered the drug he sent it to a bunch of different doctors and psychiatrists.  Then a couple decades later LSD had been popularized as a mainstream drug that people were using regularly.  A man named Timothy Leary used to throw Acid parties and a lot of people hold him responsible for getting the drug into the public eye which ultimately lead to its suppression.  I believe it was the MK Ultra projects where the military was experimenting with LSD, MDMA, and other psychedelic substances to see if they could use them as a truth drug for interrogations and a mind control substance.  What they ultimately found is that when soldiers would take LSD in military experiments the soldiers would have realizations about how wrong the war was and they would want to leave the Army.  The Government found that Albert's drug liberated the mind, not suppressed it, so they made it illegal in order to suppress the people.

             If you look into to it a bit (I'll try to be brief but there's a lot here) you'll find that Timothy Leary was good friends with Mary Pinchot Meyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mary was a CIA agent and part of MKUltra.  Leary had said that she had told him about MKUltra and that the CIA was trying to use LSD to influence high ranking government officials.  She had an affair with President Kennedy.  It's believed that she supplied Kennedy with LSD.  She was later killed and the murder was never solved.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also noted that this woman Mary Pinchot was married to Cord Meyer another high ranking CIA official who's big claim to fame was working on 'Operation Mockingbird', a plan to secretly influence domestic and foreign media.  He was also the president of an organization called United World Federalists and was into spreading the idea of 'world government'.  UFA alone is great to research because you come into some newer videos of the World Federalist Association with high ranking public officials making comments about world government.
            </p>
            <p>
             All these things seem to be intertwined somehow.

              I think a few folks Google'd it and ran off of wiki, ( hell I made LSD when I was in high school, its easy to make )
             </p>
             <p>
              So U tell me They're not mentioning Sandoz? The story on Hasbarian Encylopedia is that some guy invented LSD, and nobody ever seen it before?
             </p>
             <p>
              So I know all about LSD, ... but my point of the post is that its a philosophical inquiry, what if all the reality of 50 years of American, was all a bad trip?
             </p>
             <p>
              U telling me no mention of Sandoz? Here I give U run down, Hoffman was working on photo fixers, you know they used to develop film before cmos camera's, he mixed some shit together riding home on bike got high, next day went back sniffed the stuff got high again
             </p>
             <p>
              Hoffman didn't INVENT LSD its been around since 1600's, know as RYE-ERGOT, grows natural purple stuff on rotten rye sprouts, what Hoffman did is synthesize LSD, ..
             </p>
             <p>
              But deep state say UK, they had known about rye-ergot from 1700's, it was known as a Military Weapon to make people go nut's, if you study this shit its where witch craft came from, entire villages would eat rotten bread and go nuts see witches, ... and then burn the witches, ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Jump ahead UK had been using this shit since civil war to influence, all HOFFMAN did is accidentally figure out how to make it synthetically in a lab.

               I think a few folks Google'd it and ran off of wiki, ( hell I made LSD when I was in high school, its easy to make )
              </p>
              <p>
               So U tell me They're not mentioning Sandoz? The story on Hasbarian Encylopedia is that some kind invented LSD, and nobody ever seen it before?
              </p>
              <p>
               So I know all about LSD, ... but my point of the post is that its a philosophical inquiry, what if all the reality of 50 years of American, was all a bad trip?
              </p>
              <p>
               U telling me no mention of Sandoz? Here I give U run down, Hoffman was working on photo fixers, you know they used to develop film before cmos camera's, he mixed some shit together riding home on bike got high, next day went back sniffed the stuff got high again
              </p>
              <p>
               Hoffman didn't INVENT LSD its been around since 1600's, know as RYE-ERGOT, grows natural purple stuff on rotten rye sprouts, what Hoffman did is synthesize LSD, ..
              </p>
              <p>
               But deep state say UK, they had known about rye-ergot from 1700's, it was known as a Military Weapon to make people go nut's, if you study this shit its where witch craft came from, entire villages would eat rotten bread and go nuts see witches, ... and then burn the witches, ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Jump ahead UK had been using this shit since civil war to influence, all HOFFMAN did is accidently figure out how to make it synthetically in a lab.

            I see the John Lennon quote in the article but nothing about the entire USA public being drugged for the last 40 years and nothing about the government being broke and unable to pay for more LSD and nothing about drugging the water supply.

             No, simple click bait. Don't get me wrong, there's something there to be known, but this is more theory than conspiracy I'd say.

               I did, why do you say this? Where do the smoke and mirrors come in? How does lsd come in with it? The entire point of the article must be over my head because I can't seem to get it, that or there is no point because it's pure theory.

                Because I think the OP is profound, and I think your comments are insipid.

               <p>
                Ergo, your either a fool, or you didn't read the OP.

                Lastly, if this isn't suitable for 'conspiracy' then what the fuck it? You guys even censor conspiracy shit that is factual?

                 I read the article but I don't see the point and I don't understand where the additional "facts" you added in the post came from.

                 Personal attacks because you can't back up your point? Dude, you don't have a point here. I'm just asking what you REALLY think is going on. I'm not trying to censor you, I'm just trying to figure out what is so profound.

              I'm just confused as to why OP posted an article that didn't really seem to have much of a point, and then include additional "facts" in the post body.

               Ya same, it's all too cloudy with no real point or facts to get anything from if.

<p>If you\'re on the fence about the moon landing, or haven\'t really researched it, you might see someone mention this and think, &quot;oh well I guess all the conspiracy theories are wrong if there\'s a mirror up there, I can move on with my life now.&quot; without really examining it.</p>
<p>So I think it is an effective tool of NASA shills to keep the laser/mirror myth alive. But here I just want to briefly show how silly it is, put it out of its misery as a &quot;proof&quot; of a manned moon landing, so that I (or you!) can link back to this post in the future when the &quot;argument&quot; arises -- and it will.</p>
<p>First, let\'s take a look at the &quot;experiment&quot; in action. Notice this scene from Mythbusters:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVxSFnjYCA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmVxSFnjYCA</a></p>
<p>Does this seem like an actual scientific experiment? Does it prove anything to a viewer, really? Or does it seem like a scripted scene? Some might say it\'s the corniest bullshit they\'ve seen all day. </p>
<p>Anyway, now to kill this stupid notion of mirrors and lasers.</p>
<p>First of all, I like to point out that whenever people use this argument they often phrase it like &quot;You can reflect a laser off mirrors on the moon!&quot; as if I or the one making that claim can actually do this. We cannot; we must defer and submit to Scientific Authorities who say they can. This is an important point.</p>
<p>Anyway, the same people who believe man played golfed, hopped, and drove a buggy on the moon also believe there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunokhod_programme">lunar rovers!</a></p>
<p>This is the most obvious reaction to me when I hear people say (as Adam said in that scene from Mythbusters) that the only way lasers could be reflected is if men placed mirrors there.... but what about the rovers and space robots these NASA fanboys also believe in? Right off the bat, this assertion doesn\'t even prove men put any mirrors there -- and this is totally <em>assuming and conceding they\'re there in the first place</em>. <strong>If you believe in lunar rovers, you believe mirrors could have been put there by lunar rovers.</strong></p>
<p>Next: Here is an excerpt from a 1966 <em>National Geographic</em> article.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.americanmoon.org/NationalGeographic/index.htm">http://www.americanmoon.org/NationalGeographic/index.htm</a></p>
<p>The author states that lasers were reflected off of the moon (as in, off the lunar surface alone) as early as 1962 to measure the moon\'s distance. The first manned space walk was allegedly in 1969. <strong>You don\'t even need a mirror to reflect a laser off of the moon.</strong></p>
<p>Those two points alone kill the laser/mirror argument for the moon landings. I also like to ask people who believe in this how exactly they would aim a laser in order to find that relatively tiny reflective mirror on the moon 240,000 miles away. They can\'t say they use a telescope to spot it because if that were true we would have a telescopic photograph of these mirrors and other scenes from the moon. They can\'t say it\'s an automated process because the moon is moving relative to earth. They can only hand wave it away and defer to the Holy Scientists who surely have some Sciencey way to do this.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in this topic, Jarrah White did some good videos on it that can be found in his Youtube series &quot;Moonfaker&quot; or on his website.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> You can\'t reflect a laser off the moon; the people who say they can could also do it without mirrors at least 7 years before the first moon walk; mirrors on the moon don\'t even prove men were there because they could have been placed by rovers (if you believe in that sort of thing).</p>',

           Hello everyone -- man never landed or walked on the moon.

          <p>
           In my time online attempting to get people to pause long enough to realize this must be the case, I'm frequently faced with this pre-packaged talking point that's supposed to be a smoking gun "proof" as though I've never heard it before, which states that reflective mirrors were left on the moon's surface by Apollo astronauts, and can be targeted with lasers, the reflection of which proves that the mirrors are there, which proves a bunch of Freemasons walked there circa 1970.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you're on the fence about the moon landing, or haven't really researched it, you might see someone mention this and think, "oh well I guess all the conspiracy theories are wrong if there's a mirror up there, I can move on with my life now." without really examining it.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I think it is an effective tool of NASA shills to keep the laser/mirror myth alive. But here I just want to briefly show how silly it is, put it out of its misery as a "proof" of a manned moon landing, so that I (or you!) can link back to this post in the future when the "argument" arises -- and it will.

           Does this seem like an actual scientific experiment? Does it prove anything to a viewer, really? Or does it seem like a scripted scene? Some might say it's the corniest bullshit they've seen all day.

            its a hoax. yeah,but its not really a laser and a mirror. it is a radio receiver/transmitter on the moon, that receives a radio transmission and in turn sends a reply signal, why they call it a laser, i dont know, maybe because it is a directional pulsed radio signal, from a huge satellite dish aimed at the moon.
           </p>
           <p>
            after receiving a signal, the mirror on the moon starts to repeatedly send the reply signal. after some minutes or hours, the radio telescope computer on earth eventually confirms that it detected the mirrors reply signal.
           </p>
           <p>
            i believe there is only one radio telescope on earth that can even communicate with the supposed moon mirror, and its not even operational.

              they say they did, but there is no definitive proof that any moon mirror signal was ever detected. maybe the stupids dont need proof, they just believe anything.

             I have been seeing that video pop up in my Youtube feed but haven't watched it yet. Reminds me at first glance of the "lunar wave" videos.

            , so if the tone appears condescending to some of you I apologize. It was intended for an audience that is about 75% moon landing believers and 10% NASA shills so keep that in mind.

            My hope is that when you are faced with the moon/laser argument you now have a place to link or refer back to in order to easily parry it.

            "It might turn out to be more efficient to set up stations in areas with better infrastructure and transport people in. Even if by helo sometimes." Unfortunately a lot of people can't or don't want to travel. And get the by Helicopter? Do you have any idea how much that would cost? We're talking about millions of children here.

            "then bring in solar panels or a generator and feed it fuel." Solar panels are expensive and not always reliable, bringing fuel in is not always possible.

            Sure, there are always (well, almost always) better ways, but money is an issue as well. With unlimited funds all problems would have been solved a long time ago. It's always a balance of pro's and con's. See also my other reply. Very often there are, unfortunately, no straight and clear answers to a problem and difficult decisions need to be made all the time. Now I'm don't want to imply that it 100% sure and clear that the right choice was made, but I would like to make clear that a choice was made and that choice was made by weighing a large number of variables against each other. This article passes over any of that. Actually, it doesn't even mention the idea that maybe there were many side to consider.

            "simply buy them some refrigerators and ice chests to go along with the vaccination process" If it only were this simple!
           </p>
           <p>
            You may not realise it but in many places in the world there is no reliable electricity supply, making the use of fridges and freezers vey difficult. Yes, you can bring an generator, but these require maintenance and fuel, both of which are often in short supply in these same places. M
any area's that we're talking about are in warm climates where temperatures can easily go up to 40C or more, you need good and reliable equipment to keep things cool in those places.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the issue of quality control. Sure, as long as you can keep the vaccines under your control you can keep them in good shape, but there are very few way to accurately monitor the temperature all the way along the supply chain making the problem harder still. Especially the last kilometres to the vaccination site can be crucial, you can't carry fridges (with generators and fuels) everywhere, you you rely on cool-boxes and icepacks to keep things cool. (Ah, yes, now I need a working freezer as well...) Ice melts and again the temperature control becomes more difficult.
           </p>
           <p>
            So of course, we need to use the best possible medicine/vaccine in all cases and should never use medication that causes more harm than good, which I can assure you all major aid-agencies do. But "just bring a fridge" isn't a workable solution in many cases. So if valid alternatives that don't need refrigeration can be produced then we desperately use them. (Source: Me, I've worked in several medical aid programs in Asia and Africa.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The linked article sounds an awful lot like a conspiracy theory, that doesn't mean it's definitely not true but it leaves me with a lot of questions.
For instance: "POLIO VACCINES NOW THE #1 CAUSE OF POLIO PARALYSIS", is that because there was always a small risk associated with the vaccine and now there are very few Polio cases recorded worldwide those have become the majority? There are risks and side-effects to all medicines and cures that we have available, non are 100% safe (even Paracetamol can harm you if you take an overdose), should we then stop using all of them?

             Sorry, one more thing I wanted to add, and yes this may sound distressing but that's how  things work everywhere. There are always trade-offs to any kind of action you do, in commercial business, aid work and medicine and anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now I don't know what all the factors were in the case of the Polio vaccine and I don't know if the oral vaccine indeed has any/a higher risk of causing Polio compared to an injectable vaccine but think of this (in a very oversimplified representation):
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              With an oral vaccine I will be able to successfully vaccinate 10 million children while there is a possibility of infecting some (say 1000, or even 10.000, or 100.000) with Polio.
             </li>
             <li>
              With an injectable vaccine that does not cause Polio in anyone I can successfully vaccinate only 5 million children, leaving 5 million unvaccinated and at high risk of Polio.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Which is the better option? Do you risk the lives of those 5 million or the lives of those 1000/10.000/100.000 ?
            </p>
            <p>
             Now these numbers are entirely fictional, but it should at least give you something to think about. Life isn't always simple, answers aren't always yes or no.

            Yes, the vaccines are causing the problem. The authorities know it. It is admitted. This is not conspiracy theory, but sad fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            The system is willing to break a few eggs and ruin lives in order to achieve their global vaccination agenda – all while they insist that vaccines are both safe and effective. To say otherwise – even in the face of admitted facts – is pure heresy.

            A few years ago, I stumbled upon a big dirty secret that is harming tens of thousands of children. It was being reported overseas, but ignored by the mainstream media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doctors in India tracking problems inside the nation’s health system found a huge spike in young children who were crippled after receiving the oral polio vaccine. I

           <blockquote>

             While polio has statistically disappeared from India, there has been a huge spike in cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP)– the very types of crippling problems it was hoped would disappear with polio but which have instead flourished from a new cause.

            That’s more than 47,000 children crippled and permanently disabled by the vaccine – not the disease!

           <p>
            However, this problem was largely ignored while vaccine pushers – literally in overkill mode – were praised for nearly ‘eradicating’ polio.

           <p>
            Now, this problem is cropping up in many other countries, too.

           <p>
            At this point in time, with only a handful of cases of polio worldwide, the vaccine has become literally more dangerous than the disease.

            The oral polio vaccine is ruining lives.

            According to the Washington Post, polio has returned to Europe for the first time in five years – but now in a mutated form that even the mainstream media admits was caused by the vaccine itself.

             Poliovirus has returned to Europe after a five year reprieve, paralyzing a 4-year-old and 11-year-old in the Ukraine, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.

            <p>
             The strain responsible, vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 or cVDPV… is a rare, mutated form of the virus that comes from the vaccine itself. Oral polio vaccines contain a weakened form of the virus that activates an immune response in the body so that it builds up antibodies to protect itself. But it takes some time for this to happen, and meanwhile the virus replicates in the intestines and can be
             <em>
              excreted by the person immunized and can spread to others in the community
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             ...the vaccine-virus can circulate for long time, 12 months or longer, and genetically change into a more virulent form that can paralyze.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Authorities with the World Health Organization (WHO) are concerned that there is a high risk this mutated strain will continue to spread in and around Ukraine and to its neighbors in Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary near where the incidents occurred.

            Other confirmed cases of vaccine-derived polio have been
            <a href="http://truthstreammedia.com/2013/06/13/indian-baby-contracts-vaccine-derived-polio-virus/">
             recently reported in India

             Madagascar and South Sudan

            . This is a significant problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            What should be particularly alarming – and upsetting – and telling – is that oral polio vaccines were discontinued in the West more than 15 years ago for the very reason that the WHO and other authorities KNEW it was causing vaccine-derived polio paralysis cases!
           </p>
           <p>
            They know that this vaccine will – statistically anyway – harm some children and could potentially spawn outbreaks, but they use it anyway, supposedly because less developed regions are not equipped to handle refrigerated vaccines that don’t contain the live virus.

             Perhaps the worst part of this tragic backlash in what is meant to be a campaign to improve public health is that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UN’s World Health Organization

              knew
             </em>

             Wikipedia notes that the WHO “considers the benefits of vaccination to far outweigh the risk of vaccine derived polio.”

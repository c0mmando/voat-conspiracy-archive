            So, I've seen the assumption that she's been put in place to implement hard changes before a More feel good leader comes in. More likely... As you flat out do not make someone involved in high profile litigation your CEO... it's an attempt to cripple Reddit. Compared to other major social media and news sites, it's relatively hard to control dissent against the powerful. Could be a big conspiracy, could just be a financial decision by a competitor.

            RIP Reddit. You made too many words.

            Interesting info!
I still don't understand how she became "temp CEO of Reddit". This line doesn't really help: 
"March 2013: Ellen Pao joins popular blogging site Reddit. Becomes intern CEO for Yishan Wong. " Seems like someone "installed" her in that position with a long-term agenda in mind.

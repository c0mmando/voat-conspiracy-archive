            I'm inclined to disagree with this. There's a lot of "typically Russian" rhetoric there. Like many Western people they believe in teams and they believe in rules. This leads to fantasies such as if you want to keep suicide bombers off planes, make the seats pig-skin and then "no muslim" could set on it. He's imagined that the US and UK are always on the same side. There's some evidence for that, especially with the "five eyes", but... is there really an overwhelming Anglo strategy? (I'd say the US and the UK share interests but rule quite different games.)
           </p>
           <p>
            His example of this anglo-style deceit comes from WW2, in which he imagines that Russia was robbed. I'd say that Stalin made out like a bandit, while the US and UK were dupes with inflated egos. But, we have a difference of opinion... fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, the idea that only Germany is getting refugees? That's patently not true. I get the sense that this refugee business is causing the most problems in Germany, largely because
            <em>
             German
            </em>
            media and politicians are suppressing dissent. (I'd finger Soros as a "director" of migration, but... my information is far from consistent at this point.) I do know that there have been conflicts in Finland and Sweden and I know that Iceland was scheduled for migrants.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll keep watching though... It's interesting, but I've worked with too many Russians to believe their certainty equates to knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Urgl. The beginning is even worse! His story about Lenin shows that some people do make demands on foreign hosts, but then he claims that the migrants would know better than to make demands? He also attributes to conspiracy what Fritz Platten could have finessed much more easily than a Russian. He's imagined that liberal European bureaucracies correspond to ex-Soviet bureaucracies. I don't think he could grasp the entitlement of SJWs.
           </p>
           <p>
            More: Oh, jeez. His analysis of why migrants aren't going to other Arab countries is bad. It's like he's never talked to a progressive
            <strong>
             or
            </strong>
            an Arab.

             Dude the propaganda coming out of his mouth was real, they are funneling into Germany because it has the best benefits and is very open to accepting them. Austria may be close but it still isn't as good as Germany, and they want the best they can get.

              Well, let's return to his point (which I presume OP is promoting): is it the "Anglo Empire" telling them to go to Germany -- or is this accidental?
             </p>
             <p>
              You agree that Germany is "very open to accepting them" (perhaps we could limit that to "German politicians") and they want maximal benefits. We seem to agree there.
             </p>
             <p>
              The question is, though, how did they learn this? Did the Anglo-Empire tell them? Was it part of a plan to undermine German "independence" from a GazProm pipeline? (Poland and the Ukraine might tell you that a GazProm pipeline is the picture of slavery...) I have suspicions, but not much for proof. It was an interesting perspective, though.

               Yeah I'm not sure about the pipeline, but I honestly believe the reason they all know to go to Germany is because they knew they could have safe asylum in Turkey, and probably from news media there they found out how accepting the rest of Europe was with even better benefits. Once the news was there the first ones went and the rest followed in a line like ants ( honestly don't mean this in a derogatory way). I don't believe there's a conspiracy here, I think these Countries fucked themselves by advertising their benefits to the refugees.

                I had an Eastern European friend who, when told about Germany's refugee benefits, said, "I wish I had German benefits." I think we agree on

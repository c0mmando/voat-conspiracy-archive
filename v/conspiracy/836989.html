            A few comments down below this article, "Philip Ryan"  states the premise much more clearly. I suggest that is the real article; the statement under the headline suffers from fractured English near the end that robs it of much of its otherwise reasonable content.

             just as others imposing religious dictates on you is also a form of oppression so the best you can do in a multi religious system is to have none at all at a government level which leaves you with secular atheism (no belief at all).

There is no greater disaster than to underestimate danger. 
underestimating danger could be fatal for you, and or your country.
The Zionist Supremacist are creating or waiting for the next great crisis. 
Surely they didn’t invade Muslim countries in order to create the largest migration since the second world war and then let these traumatized immigrants inter different western countries, unchecked in order to destabilize the countries economy and create unrest.
1st. Western society is being set up for two events the first is the next great depression.
            </p>
            <p>
             We had an economic meltdown in 2008, caused by the elite.
Public money was used to bail out the elite and keep their military industrial complex going.
We are now at the beginning of a great depression, and to hide their responsibility for causing it
they have attacked a lot of muslim countries, causing the largest migration since the second world war.
All western governments are using this migration for their own advantage. 
They are allowing huge amounts of unchecked immigration into all western countries in order to cause a clash of civilizations, putting extreme financial stress on their already burden government budgets. 
The next phase of the elite's plan, is to answer the cry of the population, for order, and marshal law will be implemented. 
When they have their controls in place to control the population, the crash will come. 
It will be blamed on the Muslin immigrants for putting a large financial stress on their countries budgets.
We the people will buy into their plans like lambs to the slaughter.
Very bad times are coming be prepared. If you want to know whats going on around the world and why, then this is a must read.
            </p>
            <p>
             2nd These Statements are taken from the World-watch Institute vision for a Sustainable World and the New World Order and global population reduction
            </p>
            <p>
             "There is a growing tension between two seemingly irreconcilable trends. On one hand, moderate to conservative demographic projections indicate that global human numbers will almost certainly reach 9 billion, perhaps more, by mid-21st century. On the other, prudent and increasingly reliable scientific estimates suggest that the Earth's long-term sustainable human carrying capacity, at what might be defined as an "adequate" to "moderately comfortable" developed-world standard of living, may not be much greater than 2 to 3 billion. It may be considerably less, particularly if the normative lifestyle (level of consumption) aspired to is anywhere close to that of the United States".
            </p>
            <p>
             "As a consequence of this modern-day "Malthusian dilemma,” his theory states, "population tends to increase at a faster rate than its means of subsistence and that unless it is checked by moral restraint or disaster (as disease, famine, or war) widespread poverty and degradation inevitably result".
            </p>
            <p>
             "it is past time to think boldly about the midrange future and to consider alternatives that go beyond merely slowing or stopping the growth of global population. The human species must develop and quickly implement a well-conceived, clearly articulated, flexible, equitable, and internationally coordinated program focused on bringing about a very significant reduction in human numbers over the next two or more centuries. This effort will likely require a global population shrinkage of at least two-thirds to three-fourths, from a probable mid-to-late 21st century peak in the 9 to 10 billion range to a future (23rd century and beyond) "population optimum" of not more than 2 to 3 billion".
            </p>
            <p>
             "Obviously, a demographic change of this magnitude will require a major reorientation of human thought, values, expectations, and lifestyles. There is no guarantee that such a program will be successful. But if humanity fails in this effort, nature will almost certainly impose an even harsher reality. As a practicing physical anthropologist and human evolutionary biologist, I am concerned that this rapidly metastasizing (yet still partly hidden) demographic and environmental crisis could emerge as the greatest evolutionary/ecological "bottleneck" that our species has yet encountered".
            </p>
            <p>
             The world can no longer support the population living on it, and the damage done to it.
We are not at the end of our beginning, we are at the beginning to our end.
Last one on this planet, please turn out the lights.

              Please... That garbage line about overpopulation has been spat for 100 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Russian scientists have re-evaluated the capacity for life on earth and give conservative estimates of being able to support easily 100 Billion (10x our current population) and more than likely up to 700 Billion (100x our current population).
             </p>
             <p>
              There are vast unpopulated areas in Mongolia, Russia, China (with 1.3 Billion people, parts of China are uninhabited), the US, Canada and the South Pole.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government already admits we are manipulating weather to respond to "Climate Change" so IMO we've got that figured out.  We can control weather, we know it's man made "Climate Change", who else would be doing it?  Does having the ability to manipulate weather mean 8 Billion people should die?  No?  It means more people should live.
             </p>
             <p>
              Plain and simple it has nothing to do with Darwinianism, Evolution, Eugenics, or any rational thought, because it's Narcissists who are doing the thinking.  They will latch onto any small piece of information to support their selfish thinking.  No matter how easily disproved it is.

            Make rape accusations against someone years later when you didn't get checked out for anything back then and there is just your word and theirs, what do you expect? If you say I robbed you in 2004 while you were living in a beach house in New Orleans and you now wanted them to investigate it they would drop it as well, and I say that with 100% confidence and not because of any statue of limitations.

             Well, why are you criticizing him? He made a point, and was proven right. People kept pushing him to call the police, but he knew nothing would come out of it because of the time that passed by.

              Because it is blatant attention seeking behavior that he deserves to be called on. The press is going on about a scandal so he threw his name in as well to get in the news to talk about him and feel relevant. If it happened get help and move on at this point I refuse to feel pity for someone that has lived to be 46 and now wants to cry about his childhood. He has had time to deal with the emotional side of it, and the money to get help with it if he needed it. Now he is just saying oh this latest media fad impacted me to but it is unprovable and I will throw out some accusations to dirty names and get attention. I don't think people should get away with abusing others but if you are going to wait 30 years to talk to the cops after others have started getting press for recent accusations you are doing it for attention not to help prevent it that ship has sailed already. He could have gone after this back when there was investigation into Michael Jackson and he was involved in that or pushed it when is biography was put out. But here he is now yelling "I'm relevant again! Investigate it now, not 4 years ago when I put it in a book do it now and put me in the news!"

            Manson never killed anyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            He had a growing group of followers who killed in his name.So he was put in the can to rot.

           <p>
            A bit of a David Koresh... who was also killed for having a growing group of followers. He would've been jailed for life as well had they not been killed by the atf.

             It seems to me Vernon Wayne Howell aka David Koresh was an FBI / CIA asset who had in "their" eyes like Manson before him become unstable, whose op at Mount Carmel in Texas had become a law unto itself so they decided to eliminate him and all of his followers in one fell swoop on April 19, 1993 a date some declare to have occult ramifications.

            No.  Listen to what he says.  He was one of us.  Yes he did,lots of drugs, etc. But the stories about him are all lies, just like everyone else they paint in a bad,light when they speak out against the system.

              I have seen interviews and I'd say if nothing else, Manson was highly intelligent and articulate. His trial was obviously rigged and a farce. What WAS highly questionable, though, was the company he kept. the sources in the post above are sound; my impression is that he was set up as a scapegoat by the usual suspects. hunter s. thompson is mentioned above; if you are familiar with his non-fiction books, you will see that there was a large network of degenerate monied (chosen) people who kept various underground communities around like pets, officially just for shits and giggles. not many people talk about that, but taking another look at the 60s through that lens would probably be very revealing.

              Just look up his interviews.  He talks about where we are headed.  He focuses more on the govt corruption but he wasnt crazy and was certainly,no,killer.  I dont have any single source I just have a lot of reading,under my belt when,it comes to him because I was interested as a kid.  Once I wrote my first paper in high school I stafted to realize things werent adding up.  He talks about being self sufficient and getting away from destructive tech, etc.  He was a party hippie So of course he was doing drugs but nothing he did points toward him being some evil killer.

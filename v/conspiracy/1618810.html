<p>We know that many of these individuals are being paid to do so, so what is the agenda?</p>
<p>Well, the thing that makes the most sense to me after having thought about it for a while, is that if the left leaning students, with their fresh minds ripe for disinformation, can be taught poisonous race-based ideology and be taught the flawed idea that positive discrimination is a force for good in the world - and, if they can, as a group, therefore form strongly adhered views that &quot;the man&quot; (whoever he is) is always beating them down because of their group, whatever that is... then they are absolutely <em>ripe</em> to have that newly-sewn ideology subverted by the friends of those who deliberately &quot;educated&quot; them that way - for the globalist purpose of the removal of a nationalist-leaning leader.</p>
<p>All a wealthy globalist (that wants to further their cause) would have to do (when faced with the perceived threat of a nationalist leader) would be to turn peaceful protests across a nation into a violent spectacle, by paying anarchists to create mayhem at leftist protests, right in front of the eyes of the conservative right. By doing so, and by coercing the corrupt police departments to stand down and allow the violence to take place, they succeed at painting the <em>whole</em> spectrum of people attending the protest as violent leftists. This is very easily done when your friends and business associates in the media share your globalist objectives and are pointing the cameras where you want them to be.</p>
<p>By creating a violent situation, those in the administration who are your target, who are to the right of centre will have their hand forced. An overwhelming majority of the public will cry for a response against these &quot;violent liberals&quot;. They will see a need to respond with some kind of controlling force in order to stop the violence. This response is exactly what the globalist scum want from the nationalists, because that response can then be decried in the liberal media as being authoritarian and nazi-like behavior. &quot;See! We told you so! They\'re facist!&quot;. Since the &quot;cause&quot; of the liberals has been anti-discrimination or &quot;anti-fascism&quot;, it becomes extremely easy to seemingly-legitimately denounce the right as fascist or racist as soon as they inevitably get mad and act out of self defence.</p>
<p>This leads more and more people to distance themselves from the administration, to denounce them, and ultimately call for impeachment.</p>
<p>Globalists 1, Nationalists 0.</p>
<p>Get mad. Get very mad. But <strong>never</strong> commit an act of violence against someone else unless you are physically fighting to survive an attack from that individual in self defence.</p>
<p>If the right don\'t pay attention this game that is being played by the wealthy globalists, those globalists will have the perfect excuse to kick the right out of power.</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text. Please think about what I have written and discuss whether you agree / disagree, etc.</p>',

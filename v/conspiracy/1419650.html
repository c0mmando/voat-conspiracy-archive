            Because our society has continually weakened themselves (willingly) to the point that their immune systems don't work anymore.  Measles, mumps, flu, chickenpox aren't normally life-threatening.  Unless you have some special condition you really shouldn't be vaccinating for something that's not life-threatening.  Special conditions, fine.  But I trust that my immune system evolved over the last 2 billion years to work properly.  I don't need special crutches to get through flu season.
           </p>
           <p>
            In one respect you can think of your immune system like your muscles.  If you never have to use it, it will gradually weaken.  Why do you think these refugees don't get sick?  It's because their immune systems can handle the disease fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is similar to how the big CAFO farms have to pump cattle full of more and more drugs to keep them alive in fairly filthy conditions.  Their immune systems can't handle living in giant "cow-cities" where they don't get any sunlight and walk around in their own piss and shit.  Solution?  Pump them full of drugs to keep them "alive" long enough to get the product to market.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also why pasteurization is getting higher and higher temperatures: the bugs are surviving the process so they just crank up the heat and now we have "ultra-pasteurized" to kill more bugs.  What they should do is let the cows live how they evolved to live: outside eating green grass in the sun.  Then the cow's immune system takes care of the bugs and you can drink the milk raw.  But in these "cow-cities" their immune systems can't keep up with the terrible conditions and the bugs always take over inside the milk, so they pasteurize it.
           </p>

            A couple of years ago, my granddad got so sick he almost died.  Nobody thought anything of it, but recently I started digging into the science (and profit structures) behind this stuff and it is pretty interesting.  So I asked my mom and it turns out he had just gotten a flu shot right before he got sick.  Also turns out he's big into vaccines and volunteers every year at the church to convince people to get their flu shots.

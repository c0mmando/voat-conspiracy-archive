            It's a movie so to try an assume how the script writer portrayed Hoffa vs real life is mute.

            have been part of a crew, just depends on their knowledge/talent same with jews accountant/connects. Why do you think a trusted bodyguard could only be of the same heritage? I wasn't impressed with the movie, kind of lame actually. Seems like Lead role may have had influence on story. Irish can be hardheads &amp; hotheads but not total baffoons, I come from a long line of thick-heads. Just don't believe what you see on TV as gospel. BTW

            's path did cross Hoffa's. The movie "Kill the Irishman" is way better as well.(IMDB)

             Danny Greene's story looks plausible. It's still weird that he worked for the kikes.

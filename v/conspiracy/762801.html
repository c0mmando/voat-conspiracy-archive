            There is still something missing here. That other site used to have first hand accounts of events as they happened. During aurora Boston Newton there was immediate firsthand information, Voat doesn't seem to have the number of users needed for that and the other site is controlling those now. I miss those kinds of posts.

            Reddit is/has pushed out most people who do not follow the current social justice politically correct naratives. They wanted their safe space echo chamber and will get it at their own loss.
           </p>
           <p>
            I like many others left reddit because I would rather speak my mind for what I see, not what they demand I see.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well when everyone has the same exact mind and accepts the naratives it hurts discussion all around as what fun are these kind of sites if you only are going to read what you want and expect and never at least hear from the other side of the table.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like you said there is a lot here you don't like, and I guarantee I contribute to those voices you don't like. Just remeber without us it is just another clone pushing a dying narative that is all for control of your mind, and without us it is just a boring circle jerk of faggotry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit : lol I checked op comment history and he actually linked to my profile in the past to call me a racist trying to shut down comments, instead of trying to refute what I said. Posting the same u raycis whine twice while ignoring the content. Op is the problem. He cries for a diverse voice yet just like reddit faggots would rather ignore and brigade what he doesn't agree with and what he is unable to argue against.
           </p>
           <p>
            So tldr op just get off voat and stick to reddit, because it's your kind that has ruined it. You can enjoy your shill postings of conspiracies there and help ruin that site.

             Interesting, I don't recall you, but so be it, I don't really get into user histories to much. I prefer to be present online, more interested in what the content is rather than who the user is.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said, if you don't approve of a little criticism, then you might have a thin skin.

            <p>
             By the way, what you just did with your
             <em>
              Edit
             </em>
             , i.e., track down history to base your opinion on the validity of the current discussion is the wet dream of controllers. What you just did is why we can't have anonymity.

            <p>
             By the way, I did mention this twice in my post but just in case you missed it:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              that goes both for opinions I agree with and those that I don't.
             </p>

              I enjoy critics just fine. You use the same old tired bullshit that you are here complaining about now.
             </p>
             <p>
              As to the edit, I I clicked your name and noticed you linking my profile, and the irnony was too much. To try to stifle thoughts you don't agree with as if calling someone a racist while ignoring what was said wins the aurgument. Your nothing but a piece of shit now here crying about another website that you are part of the problem. Good night go fuck yourself worthless cuck.

               How far back did you have to go to find that link because I sure as hell don't remember you.

               As you being a racist, here is some advice that you should live by, you should own what you are, and if you don't then you're a coward. And just so others aren't confused, the top subverse that you have submitted to is
               <a href="/v/niggers">
                /v/Niggers
               </a>
               , and the following is your most recent comment:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Expel them all back to their shit deserts. Burn down and raze every last mosque. And lastly kill any that refuse to leave.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               Just to be clear, I have no problem with you, I think you have the right to express your opinion and I think you should have the right to live as you want, but when you start crying for someone calling you out for what you obviously are admitting that you are, then brother, you're a child and you don't belong on an adult forum.

                I didn't comb your post history, it was under user summery.  And I don't care I'm proud of being a racist, that word has no negative effect on me. Again you are the faggotry that ruins everything.

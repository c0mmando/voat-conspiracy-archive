            Thank you, this video is as amazing as you say, no exaggeration.  I've kind of long been in the vaccines are dangerous but necessary camp.
            <em>
             The needs of the many
            </em>
            so to speak. Her correlation of data is amazing and seems to really spell out that they are in fact not necessary.  Too many of the arguments against vaccination are far flung conspiracy theories.  The instant any moderate, like me, hears that we are being groomed for takeover by alien overlords through vaccinations, we are obviously going to shy away from the anti-vaccination camp.  It's this kind of presentation that the public needs to see. Thank you for this link.

             I am so stoked that you watched this! I received my vaccinations as a baby but my mom was an early adopter of questioning them so I was raised throughout school without them. I love my mom but after seeing so many crackpot anti-vaccination doctors and never really a level-headed argument from either side, I started to get wrapped up in the fear the last few months and felt the overwhelming need to find some semblance of an unbiased report. Seriously, one week after researching and I feel like a new person with 0 fear.
            </p>
            <p>
             I actually went down the rabbit hole today researching Merck and apparently last October they were coming under a ton of criticism about the efficacy of their MMR vaccines, with 2 Merck scientists-turned-whistle-blowers successfully getting whistle-blower immunity from Obama (fucking shocker, honestly). They have a lawsuit against Merck right now that NO ONE is reporting on. It's huge.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm starting to see a huge trail of media fear-mongering that's in line with their problems as a company and will be doing a large write up for the sub soon. Stay tuned if you're interested! I'm about to add the corporate interests into this argument and make my case.

            I'm really confused about all this vaccination talk recently. Why is the media pushing it now, of all times? It's always been a latent grumble, but right now it just seems like a distraction from bigger issues.

              I feel like I'm in the smallest group of people in America who question vaccination. Even my usual friends whom I respect in terms of politics, etc, have jumped on this anti-vaxxer boogey man science train and it annoys me. I can't tell if there are a lot of us in hiding or if we really are on the extreme fringe of this subject.

               As an outsider I'm a little amused looking at how emotional and divisive the whole argument has become in your country.

               People have been around long before vaccines were invented and they were doing just fine. A little measles is no reason to hyperventilate and go into full blown panic calling everyone to get vaccinated. In fact it'll teach your immune system how to deal with threats and it will be stronger and prepared for the next fight.

              <p>
               I remember having measles when I was in school and it wasn't like being in hell. A lot of my friends and classmates also had it around the same age. My grandmother, who hasn't studied beyond 3rd grade, told me it's just a rite of passage and everyone gets it and the sooner you get it over with the better as it will make you less susceptible to other diseases.

               What about legal liability? I read somewhere that the companies producing the vaccines are complete free of any liability from any ill effects (including death?) the vaccine may have on the receiver. People even have to sign waivers before getting a vaccine. ROFL.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are many reasons not to get vaccinated. But, first and foremost, people should have sovereignty over their own bodies and have the right to make informed choice about it.
              </p>
              <p>
               The main argument for vaccination i.e. herd immunity as the pro-vaxxers call it is ridiculous. If you're vaccinated and your vaccine works, then it shouldn't matter that others around you are not vaccinated. The whole argument is utter bollocks if you ask me and it's just proof that vaccines aren't nearly 100% effective.

            <ol>
             <li>
              Create apathy &amp; abulia among the learned 
– This component is central to Operation Mockingbird, led by Alex Jones in the “truth movement”. Initiates are gradually made comfortable (at least subconsciously) with what is happening. Comfort and outrage (discomfort) are polar opposites. If you have listened to Alex Jones for any period of time, you will know that he hammers very bad and negative news at you continually throughout the day. While the news is very real, the way it is presented is meant to break you down, to destroy the outrage and burning passion in you. This bombardment of negative, sometimes conflicting information tends to leave the listener feeling helpless and fearful, but ultimately, it brings them closer to a state of apathy and abulia (loss of will).

             I've seen that racist website before and not one of the things they propose as truth has any proof what-so-ever.  The whole site is full of lies and racist rants.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here you try to spin Operation Mockingbird as if it's led by Alex Jones while making up lies about what Operation Mockingbird really was.
            </p>
            <p>
             Operation Mockingbird
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Begun in the 1950s, it was initially organized by Cord Meyer and Allen W. Dulles, and was later led by Frank Wisner after Dulles became the head of the CIA. The organization recruited leading American journalists into a network to help present the CIA's views, and funded some student and cultural organizations, and magazines as fronts. As it developed, it also worked to influence foreign media and political campaigns, in addition to activities by other operating units of the CIA.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Operation Mockingbird was to help the CIA present their views as good.  Alex Jones does not do this and even goes out of his way to teach people about Operation Mockingbird.  So your claim that he is CIA makes no sense.  It's more likely that
             <em>
              you
             </em>
             are working for them because your coming out spreading lies and racist hate and trying to get people to hate him.  While nothing on that website has an inch of proof of anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think you're crazy as hell to believe any of the lies on that insane website you listed.  That website is full of racist crap against the Jewish people.  You're the reason people keep calling

             racist.  And why they have come to this website.  Thanks for putting your name out there though for everyone to see who you are and what you are.

              I'm sure your little rant made you feel a little better. Besides, It's easy casting blame on everyone else instead of looking to oneself.

              Alex Jones spreads fear. And contrary to what Yoda says - fear doesn't lead to anger. Fear leads to apathy. That's what's intended with this crap.

               I'm not afraid when I listen to him I can't help it if you are.  People who live in fear tend to attack others the way you do.  You're afraid Alex Jones is waking people up to the corruption of the government.  Well.  Too late.  Too bad for you.  I bet that comment about 'my rant' made you feel a little better.  And contrary to what your movie idols say stay away from racists.  It's not cool and it makes you look like a douche.  Go back to Reddit with your racism.

                You are into name calling, doing the racist card without any reason whatsoever. And of course the ad hominem argumentation. Essentially you have nothing. And I'm done with you.

            Long long ago I was an Alex Jones listener, but they should call him "often-wrong" Jones. I still have egg on my face from repeating some of his predictions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think when people take the red pill, or whatever... they find themselves without guidance, without a guiding star. Alex Jones will tell you The Truth™ with absolute authority, and that's comforting, when you suddenly find yourself in the wilderness with no one else to follow. All the other media voices you trusted have been exposed as hacks. I haven't listened to him in a long time, but he did teach me an important lesson. There is no authority on what is true and what isn't.

             Same here. I found this video to be interesting:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeUoKMSl3o">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCeUoKMSl3o

            </p>
            <p>
             There was another one i saw that claimed jones was cointelpro, showed him trying to disrupt a peaceful protest by bringing out his megaphone and ranting nonsense, another where he went absolutely bonkers on his show interviewing someone who was by all appearances relatively normal... it was really bizarre. I don't know if jones is cointelpro per se, or if he's just in it for the money, or if he believes what he's saying, or if he just thinks he's an entertainer. Regardless of all that, he does serve some purpose, and did
             <em>
              help
             </em>
             me to sort of wake up. I've seen a few infowars articles that even had decent sources. But whenever jones is involved in something, I take a hyperskeptical look at it.

              Video?  More like audio with a gif like loop going.   Bill Cooper believed in aliens and shot a cop because he was paranoid.  He has some fun stuff out there to listen to but you take what he say as proof of anything.  The audio from Alex Jones is from the Y2K paranoia that was going around at the time.  Alex Jones was not very up on computers back then and probably still isn't.

             <p>
              Anyways here's Bill Cooper claiming that the government is working with aliens:

              And everything he says in the audio you posted he does in the video I posted.  lol

               Yeah, you're correct it's audio. And yes bill cooper put forth some odd stuff. I don't think that means there is no merit in what's in the audio of the video I linked - just like I think there is merit in some of the things Alex Jones says. I am sorry if what I said offended you, it wasn't my intention to do so. Was just sharing my perspective on the subject.

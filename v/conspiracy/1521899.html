            Yeah right. The smell of a coverup.

            PizzaGate is real and that should be the research vector because of the enourmous amounts of circumstantial evidence.

           <p>
            Not this conspiracy theory about a satanic pedocult being a psyop. That is bullshit. Dont' fall for it.

            The McMartin Preschool case is a highlight of the satanic panic. All the evidence I have seen is that there were actual satanists and pedophiles at that school. FBI director of LA found evidence of tunnels along with Phd scientists and Archeologists. The prosocutor never acknowledged the evidence when it was found.
           </p>
           <p>
            Satanic Panic was very similar to pizzagate, and they actually had a lot of victims and their families came forward. Bull shit like false memory syndrome and other things were brought up to discredit the abused.

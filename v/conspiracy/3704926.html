</p>
<p><em>There are many bibles.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>Why is there such divide between the Judaic, Christian and Muslim beliefs, which are all rooted in the Old Testament accounts of Abraham?</strong>    
</p>
<p>NOTE : Abraham is a Patriarch figure for three major religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam). God called on Abraham to found a new Nation, believed to be the land of Canaan-later Israel. Abraham is believed to have existed 430 years before Moses and the Exodus of the Hebrews out of Egypt (ca. 1500- 1200 BC). Abraham’s God is referred to as Yahweh or Jehovah.   
</p>
<p><em>There are Beings who exist and are fully aware of the problem that exists and these Beings have assisted in writing some of these works in an attempt to relay information. What has occurred is the further attempt to twist any truth remaining in these stories.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is the “problem that exists” that was originally being communicated in the Bible stories?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>The “problem” is that Man Being is trapped in the Earth plane existence and wishes to return home. The original idea and intention was to disseminate using creative storytelling. This would allow ideas to be absorbed without alarming the “authorities” that were and are opposed to the ascension journey.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Are you suggesting that these religious groups are misinterpreting the stories?</strong>  
</p>
<p><em>The real understanding of these truths extends beyond the horizon of your existence. There is information contained in the Bible dissemination but you must reformulate the understanding. Those who are not inclined to reconnect and reassemble their beliefs will have no interest in a new belief or a new belief pattern. You cannot teach someone a new belief. They must inspire themselves to that effect. We want to be as clear as possible in this discussion.</em> </p>
<p><strong>You are saying that there are truths in the Bible but that we have not correctly interpreted them. Is that accurate?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>Yes. We are not suggesting that you continue to subscribe to these Scriptures in the manner that is currently practiced by Man Being. This is about perception. There is another way to absorb  the information and process the beliefs as we have explored in the discussion about Virgin Mary. The descriptions and parables in these Bible books have been grossly misinterpreted.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>Notwithstanding the risks you mentioned, wouldn’t it have been more effective to disseminate the unfiltered truth?</strong></p>
<p><em>Sharing your experience with others in an “unfiltered” manner does not guarantee a similar experience for readers and listeners. The ability to reconnect and understand that there is more beyond what you see and perceive is an obstacle that you are all trying to surmount. The ability to reconnect is an ability that one must acquire themselves. The understanding that there is a necessary set of questions that one must ask in order to inspire a re-connective experience is the goal of your dialogue and dissemination. Those questions are individual.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Is this dissemination teaching others how to reconnect?</strong></p>
<p><em>The ability to ask the right questions and ask the questions that you want and need to hear is the skill that you will be teaching others. You will want to inspire others to ask the right questions. The questions that you are asking are not necessarily the questions that others will ask. This is the challenge that you all face. This was and is the challenge faced by those Beings who disseminated the Bible truths. There is an individual path of one’s ascension. This path cannot be taught in a set of instructions. Experience is not instructional.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>Religious organizations have been murdering people for centuries over Scriptural beliefs . It’s difficult to accept what you’re saying. There had to be a better way of relaying the truth.</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>There is a hijack of your collective experience, a misinterpretation of experience. The belief that the Bible is a literal manual for the ascension experience is an unfortunate misunderstanding  and incorrect . The codes that are presented in the Bible and Bible books are not designed to ascend you via a map of your own awareness. They are a set of codes that may inspire you to ask further questions. The ability to be truthful to oneself is a challenge in your existence. There is a need to abide by a code through the Bible as in a moral code or a moral truth. The moral truth is not the same as a code of ascension.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>What is lacking most in our current interpretation of these Bible books?</strong></p>
<p><em>The ability to understand that there is a world beyond yours is not something that is imagined in the Bible interpretation. Mankind perceiving the Bible dissemination as a literal device and manual for spiritual awareness is an unfortunate conclusion. Mankind has subscribed to the false Heaven/Hell paradigm and not sought further understanding. The ability to perceive that there are other worlds such as ours is a unique experience. This experience requires that you reevaluate your understanding of the Bible.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>Are you asking us to decode the Bible for others?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>This is not your task to decode and translate the meaning. Your task is to disseminate awareness that asking questions and seeking higher truths may unlock one\'s own  personal understanding of these Bible Books. It is the re-connection and the ability to once again engage with the world beyond your world that is the desired outcome.</em>  
</p>
<p><strong>Are you suggesting that we explore hidden Bible truths in order to ascend and reconnect?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>This is not accurate. This is not a suggestion that you must all now subscribe to these Scriptural truths or religious factions. Your Bibles have not been absorbed accurately. Your Bibles have been tampered with. Your religions have been hijacked. This is what we are communicating.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Can you give us another teaching or passage in the Bible that was hijacked or inaccurately conveyed?</strong></p>
<p><em>Reformulate your understanding of Abraham and the attempted sacrifice of his son.</em>   
</p>
<p>NOTE : The cited passage is contained in Genesis ,  Chapter 22. God tests Abraham’s devotion by asking him to sacrifice his son Isaac . Just as Abraham is about to kill his son, God asks him to sacrifice a ram instead.   
</p>
<p><strong>Why would a benevolent god require someone to murder his or her child - or any living creature for that matter?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>The ascribed violence in this parable and the appeasement to a “god” is an example of how your Bible has been tampered with. Abraham arrived to assist Man Being in the journey homeward. The Mission to bring everyone home failed. The Mission was aborted.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Was this parable simply about a failed mission to bring us back home?</strong> </p>
<p><em>Three major religions based their entire belief system on Abraham’s blind obedience to a god. The book known as Genesis is not a coherent work.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>What does the sacrifice in this parable represent?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>The idea that a sacrifice is necessary is equivalent to the voluntary disconnect experience.</em> </p>
<p><strong>When you recommend that the word sacrifice is equated with the disconnect experience you will ask yourself is it “involuntary” or “voluntary”.</strong> </p>
<p><em>This is the issue that you must address in this passage. The history that you are rewriting is a reorganization about the belief in disconnection.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>To clarify, you’re saying that sacrificing the son represents an involuntary disconnect and the fact that Abraham “aborts” the sacrifice reinforces a belief in the voluntary disconnect principle.</strong>  
</p>
<p><em>This is a correct understanding. It was not written very clearly. Sacrificing the son is an involuntary disconnect experience and the parable was to make this very clear. The truth of this written account is that the meaning and definition of ascension has been misinterpreted and no longer has any clarity. The correction of this passage pertains to the re-connection with the disconnection. You must also be aware that the visitation experiences of Abraham and Moses are a similar experience.</em>*</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean by “visitation experience”?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>The visitation occurs after the leader of the Mission is aware and able to relay the information that the undertaking is to commence. There is an experience that you are interpreting as a Messiah event. This event is the first step in the visitation experience.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Abraham was a leader who arrived to retrieve Beings and assist in their return home. Yet Abraham wasn’t able to bring us all home.</strong>    
</p>
<p><em>Correct. The Mission was aborted. These experiences and missions have occurred and continue to occur. The first in the Bible dissemination is explained through this parable of Abraham and Isaac. The second is the experience of Moses and the two tablets.</em>  
</p>
<p>NOTE : The cited passage is found in the Book of Exodus chapter 32, verse 19. In it ,Moses descends from the mountain with tablets containing God’s message. </p>
<p>He becomes angered and smashes the tablets at the foot of the mountain when he sees his people dancing around a golden calf (idol worship).    
</p>
<p><strong>Are you referring to when Moses destroys the first set of tablets in anger?</strong>   
</p>
<p><em>This is correct. The broken tablets represent the aborted Mission. The Moses parable in the Book known as Exodus is a story that points to another visitation experience. We will discuss the Sinai experience further.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Back to the passage of Abraham’s sacrifice, what are we to make of the dialogue between Abraham and his god?</strong>    
</p>
<p><em>These dialogues are modified to perpetuate a belief system that does not benefit Man Being.</em> </p>
<p><strong>What would be accurate to insert into this parable in terms of words spoken by Abraham?</strong> </p>
<p><em>“The undertaking has failed we must return home”.</em>   
</p>
<p><strong>Is the mission of this book to help us reconnect to the worlds you’re calling “home”?</strong></p>',

            What do you mean by “visitation experience”?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            The visitation occurs after the leader of the Mission is aware and able to relay the information that the undertaking is to commence. There is an experience that you are interpreting as a Messiah event. This event is the first step in the visitation experience.

           <strong>
            Abraham was a leader who arrived to retrieve Beings and assist in their return home. Yet Abraham wasn’t able to bring us all home.
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            Correct. The Mission was aborted. These experiences and missions have occurred and continue to occur. The first in the Bible dissemination is explained through this parable of Abraham and Isaac. The second is the experience of Moses and the two tablets.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           NOTE : The cited passage is found in the Book of Exodus chapter 32, verse 19. In it ,Moses descends from the mountain with tablets containing God’s message.
          </p>
          <p>
           He becomes angered and smashes the tablets at the foot of the mountain when he sees his people dancing around a golden calf (idol worship).
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Are you referring to when Moses destroys the first set of tablets in anger?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            This is correct. The broken tablets represent the aborted Mission. The Moses parable in the Book known as Exodus is a story that points to another visitation experience. We will discuss the Sinai experience further.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Back to the passage of Abraham’s sacrifice, what are we to make of the dialogue between Abraham and his god?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            These dialogues are modified to perpetuate a belief system that does not benefit Man Being.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What would be accurate to insert into this parable in terms of words spoken by Abraham?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <em>
            “The undertaking has failed we must return home”.
           </em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Is the mission of this book to help us reconnect to the worlds you’re calling “home”?

            "They" apparently, somehow, thought that parables and allegory wouldn't be misinterpreted? Or that, maybe, they aren't as smart as they thought themselves to be? Jeesh... How could it possibly go all wrong? Seems Natural Law and human nature were just not considered in that great plan. Just the damn truth would be great so how about you "planners up there" try again and get it right this time, instead of watching us all chase our damn tails over bullshit or is the admittance of "Oops! We fucked up!" just too much for you?

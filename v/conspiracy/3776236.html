            That's certainly what it is, you're right about that.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it won't be recorded that way. Too many followers were fooled and bought into it. Too many leaders have sold it hard and profited from it. None of them will be eager to admit they were so very wrong in such a big way. All of them are now invested in perpetuating the lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            They'll do anything to keep it alive. They'll brand any who question it "deniers", and treat them as heretics. They'll keep agreeing and affirming their belief, to avoid being treated that way themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is how big falsehoods propagate and thrive. Not through overt global conspiracy. But through individual cowardliness and self-interest.
           </p>
           <p>
            This also isn't the biggest one. I'll bet there's at least one that is bigger, and that you still believe in. You probably know the one I mean.

            Months ago it was impeachment. Before that it was Russia collusion. Now it is the Chinese virus. They will find something else to replace it and keep the masses distracted. It is a common tactic: Overwhelm the populace with constant scandals so that they become desensitized, lose track, and stop caring. Every day is always a bombshell that gets replaced by another one.

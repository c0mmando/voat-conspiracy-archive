<p>I’m compiling a list of sites you should heavily consider removing from your life as well as potential alternatives to fill the void. Maybe we can inflict change as consumers but if not, at least we won’t be as swayed by their agenda as we’re out of their system.</p>

<li>Hits their bottom line. Even if it\'s only a miniscule amount. They\'re using your aggregated data to track things, in turn shaping how much they charge for ads. You\'re a part of their bottom line, as small as that part may be.</li>
<li>These companies have proven they\'re untrustworthy with your data multiple times, the less they have of yours the better.</li>
<li>Maybe, just maybe, we can prop up enough companies doing things right that the big dogs will change their ways. <em>(Hopelessly optimistic, I know)</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong>
Ideally you\'ll completely delete your facebook. Some of you might not be willing to  completely detach from social media because you\'d like to keep in touch with relatives/friends/whomever. Understandable. If that\'s too much at the moment, I\'d highly recommend completely scrubbing your facebook of content, opting to just use the messenger option. (Delete the facebook app from your phone too)</p>
<p>Facebook Post Manager will help you clear your entire timeline: </p>

<p><strong>Twitter</strong>
Don’t have any alternatives to recommend for Twitter, but you should definitely delete your account(s) and abstain from giving them any more views than necessary. If anyone has a solid alternative I’ll throw it up here.</p>
<p><em>Alternatives:</em></p>
<p>Gab.ai - It\'s small, but growing.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://voat.co/user/DownTheRabbitHole">/u/DownTheRabbitHole</a> </p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong>
This is a beast and most of you won\'t be able to  completely detach yourselves, as with this entire list, every little bit helps. Do what you\'re willing / want to do.</p>
<p><strong>Google Search Engine:</strong>
This is probably the easiest one to remove yourself from, just switch your default search engine on your browsers and phone.</p>
<p><em>Alternatives:</em></p>
<p>DuckDuckGo - <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">https://duckduckgo.com</a></p>
<p>Pros: emphasizes protecting searchers\' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search </p>
<p><strong>Chrome:</strong>
Definitely ditch chrome or any chromium based browser as the tracking is essentially the same for either.</p>
<p><em>Alternatives:</em></p>
<p>Firefox - <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a></p>
<p>Pros: open-source, pro-privacy, community-made, easy transition from chrome (Most of you used this before chrome anyways)</p>
<p><strong>Gmail &amp; Youtube:</strong> 
If you haven’t already, go through all your security and privacy settings, disable all the tracking features and Adsense tailored ad features on both. </p>
<p><em>Alternatives:</em>
Open to recommendations as I don’t have any solid suggestions here.</p>
<p><strong>Reddit:</strong>
It’s become clear that we shouldn’t put all our eggs in one basket, relying on reddit is no longer a good strategy. No one site should have all that power.</p>
<p><em>Alternatives:</em></p>
<p>Voat - <a href="https://voat.co/">https://voat.co/</a></p>
<p>Pros: It’s not reddit.</p>
<p><strong>Online News Sources:</strong>
The list of compromised sources is endless, it’s best to err on the side of caution and assume everything is compromised unless you have evidence otherwise. That said, here’s a list of sites that aren’t as bad as the majority:</p>
<p>The Intercept - <a href="https://theintercept.com/">https://theintercept.com/</a></p>
<p>Wikileaks <em>(Potentially Compromised?)</em> - Wikileaks.org</p>
<p><strong>Cut The Cord:</strong>
Self explanatory really. You\'re either willing to cut your cable package or you\'re not. There’s plenty of alternatives and I’m sure most of you know and already use them.</p>
<p>This list is definitely incomplete and if you have any better recommendations or if you have websites that should be cut off, please let me know in the comments and I’ll try to update the list. I’m trying to keep this to consumer products that we should boycott as opposed to focusing on privacy (hence the lack of VPN / Tor recommendations) Though you should definitely look into that stuff if you’re interested in taking it a step further!</p>',

            I think your title is right. But let the fuckers track me. I didn't get myself put on the lists but the best the I can is make noise where it can wake some people up and provide distraction/cover for those more important than I.

            But best way to hit them is the wallet. Avoid fiat money all together if &amp; when possible. Make or trade things. Buy stuff that is not owned by known globalist control freaks - local/low miles is usually best. Don't buy things you don't need.

            THEY ARE NOT PRIVATE. THEY STORE USE DATA, USE COOKIES, WILL SELL YOU OUT TO THE GOVERNMENT. Too many people think Duckduckgo is a good source and use it for "private" searches but i'm telling you if you value privacy to switch immediately.

            Safe? Yeah, it's probably as safe as any other email provider.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure Gmail is safe too, I don't think Google actively reads our emails or anything like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're definitely altering the search results and hiding things to help keep the population disinformed though. Leaving Google is less about keeping your emails safe than it is about removing yourself from their profits because they're using those profits for nefarious reasons.

            I don't know what role Yahoo has taken this election season, I haven't heard any news from them good or bad. Maybe someone else with more knowledge on that part can chime in.

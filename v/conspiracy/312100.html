            I think there is an organized push by Jewish owned media to control any negative information about Israel. Which is sad. And very dangerous for them. But they seemed determined to use their power to protect this nasty little country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering reddit is owned and run mostly by Jewish people and they view Israel like it's the North Pole where Santa lives, they are acting way crazy. They have stopped pretending they are unbiased about Israel and people can say what they want.

            removed two different videos on the USS Liberty, one by Al Jazeera, one by the BBC and removed over 1500 comments. And most of the comments go1dfish captured and they are not antisemitic.

            nope you are not wrong - humans are the issue. reptilians are just like you or the next guy there are good and bad, "humans" don't keep the balance in the galaxies, we are currently only managing affairs on earth, until we can handle that we will not be venturing much past this atmosphere.

            There's always been censorship of unpopular opinions.  We actually have much more freedom now because we can control where we look, and there is
            <em>
             somewhere
            </em>
            you can find the information.  I've recently been considering moving my website offshore (Iceland), because censorship is alive and well everywhere, and it is going to get worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the sources of information multiply, the efforts of people to control the flow of information will only increase.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media, the liberals, and the conservatives have practiced this for decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example: The Transpacific Partnership Agreement, arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation in the 21st century, is completely overshadowed by information about Bill Cosby, Donald Trump, and whatever actress is dressing most provocatively at the moment.  The details of this partnership are not easy to find. Information about the Internal Revenue Service's targeting conservative groups is difficult to obtain; government agencies routinely ignore FOIA requests, and nobody hollers about it. 
Glenn Greenwald appears to be one of the few people who actually notices this stuff. Many in the media just ignore the disinformation and the holes in the information supplied, and let it all happen.
I don't think it's going to change, and at some point in time, the searches will become more and more difficult.  Most of the news organizations slant all their news the way they want the readers to think, or they specifically target readers who think like they do. I'm not sure which. 
Francis Schaeffer (Christian author of the 20th century, Swiss) actually wrote about this in his series, "
            <em>
             How Shall We then live
            </em>
            ?" Given the fact that these things have come to pass almost like he said, it's almost like he was a prophet.  However, what he did was merely look at trends and extrapolate.  He died in 1985, after a long career in Christian philosophy.  What he predicted was scary.  His position was that news organizations would at some point begin to manufacture their news by removing items that didn't suit their positions and would add in and emphasize information that agreed with them.  That's always happened, but the ability to do it has multiplied almost infinitely because of the ability to manipulate photography and video, and selectively report stories that agree with their position.
We desperately need people like Mr. Snowden, but directed more at regular news stories that are mis-reported, underreported, or not reported at all.

               Its not necessarily being in the know in as much as its in who controls. Knowing is fine but it ALWAYS comes back to that Golden Rule... He who has the gold rules. You better believe.

            I've got to agree... The game is afoot. As citizen journalists we're the last line. Basically it boils down to the truth behind 9/11 and the indoctrination of tHE nEW wORLD oRDER. Politically Correct codespeak to subvert the Constitution and implementation of The Rome statute.

            I switched to FF during the NSA scandal and haven't touched chrome since, but I've never been able to switch to DuckDuckGo. I know that they use a lot of google search results in DDG, and I was hoping that they've improved it since the last time I gave up on it. I'll just have to use it for awhile again and determine if it's 'good enough'.

            They are trying new ways to attempt to control the flow of information. It was easy back when there were only 4 channels on TV. They are using the spaghetti method -- throwing everything they can at the internet and new media and hope something sticks. They don't understand that they built a panopticon society and can't escape it.

            I think it's just the SJW mindset that's now become so pervasive. People have given up all critical thinking, and just want to believe what they perceive as the "right thing".  This involves making sure everyone hears the right story, and all conflicting opinions are shamed immediately.  Welcome to our future.  Ignorance is Strength.

            When Reddit began to censor needlessly, at the expense of it's users, I moved to Voat.  Now that google is beginning to needlessly filter things I am starting my transition to duckduckgo.

            While it's pretty well known that Facebook, YouTube, and other sources of sharing information across social media have no qualms in censoring or taking down material for various reasons—Reddit for a long time appeared to be a hold out for the most part (although I wouldn't doubt they've helped bury things since day one). In addition to corporate influence—I imagine there's pressure coming from military and domestic security institutions as well in having certain users shadowbanned or certain ideas suppressed. In fact at this point—you have to wonder if Reddit's censorship abilities may be more profitable than other forms of legitimate monetization.
           </p>
           <p>
            With smart phones everywhere today and the ability of information to run viral so fast—one can only imagine how quickly this would destroy official narratives coming from government and corporate sources for all types of embarrassing events or fabricated storylines. It's one thing to wage war or conduct business when you've got a small handful of press operations with the capability to cover a story; it's a whole different ballgame when just about everyone's got a camera in their pocket and the ability to broadcast it to the world nearly instantaneously. Look at the  recorded incidents of police killings in the last year and the kind of civil unrest this has caused. I don't think this is lost on those in positions of power.
           </p>
           <p>
            If G.W. Bush's Iraq War were fought today I imagine there would be a whole host of information flow controls we have never seen in wide deployment in the U.S. As anybody has seen when this country goes to war—the media falls in lock step with government sources—and a lot of people get their news via the web today so similar methods of narrative shaping are likely to be used across the web; whether web based news sources are complicit or not. The FBI has been known to create fake websites to fool individuals that have been targeted for investigation, so it's not too much of a stretch to imagine the Pentagon using similar methods against press operations and social media networks on the web to control what the public sees.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could be wrong of course, but I think there is a growing worry in Washington and among the wealthy elite of a fomenting revolution or civil war. A modern day slave rebellion if you will (or debt-slave rebellion). If all the NSA stories are true, these fears are not likely unfounded and I wouldn't doubt that there are those in the U.S. National Security realm who look at the great firewall of China with admiration and envy. Practices like shadowbanning are likely to grow in the coming years in the U.S. and extend to nearly every form of non-commercial communication with strangers electronically. Even if information spread isn't controlled exactly this way, there's a lot of history to show that all governments and corporations have a deep desire to control what you know and what you don't on every platform. It's in their best interest to quarantine certain people or ideas; especially those that aren't entrapped, or bought off and act out of conscience.

            There's usually a one way street heading towards totalitarian state until a new frontier is doscovered, the quest for which partially motivated by the yearning to be free. It was/is easily predictable that when the 4th estate existed in the mid 1990's, use if the internet to organize grass roots movements weren't a problem to capital hill or wall street, but they would become a problem, and then the problem would be dealt with the same way radio, paper, TV, etc have been dealt with by the 4th estate.

            If you successfully punch congress in the stomach, they cover their stomach. If you poke wall street in the eye, they protect their eyes. The same attack isn't likely to work repeatedly.

            I feel the plebs power to organize online peaked at SOPA/PIPA's organized opposition and will decline for the rest of history with thought control.

            I think all the things that are going on right now concerning censorship, TPP the flag thing .. and the attack on the navy ship. Are all being censored because within the lines of each bit of information is more in depth information so to speak. A kind of read between the lines sort of thing. Hence the people who are responsible for all these things want to cover,so that the few folks who can see the hidden things in the information cant see it. I think its all a smoke screen for the bigger things that may be coming in the future. Distractions so to speak. So that when the shit hits the fan so big that people cant help but notice. It will catch most off guard.

             The think tanks planning the passing of the TPP learned a lot from the failure of PIPA, which was too hasty to learn anything from SOPA. The MPAA/RIPA were so outraged their congressional slaves disobeyed their bidding, they demanded the only bill written or voted would be SOPA2.
            </p>
            <p>
             The TPP is backed by far greater money than the MPAA/RIPA. Greater than the entire 4th estate.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the global banks and thus global corporations are funding the TPP.

             The world's poor are getting richer, faster, than the USA's poor. The USA's wealthy are getting richer, faster, than the rest of the world. This is creating a huge rift between the US rich and US poor, and closing the gap between the US poor and rest of the world poor.

             It will not be long before banks tire of the illusion of a republic in the USA and spread propaganda against national sovereignty. I cannot comment on the EU but possibly same.

             What good is national sovereignty when the same banks own all of the career politicians or political parties across borders?

               Not sure who downvoted you. Shame. Perhaps they didn't like your use of the word shills. Perhaps it was nothing about this comment, and they were just downvoting everything in your history for something they didn't like elsewhere. This site is just Reddit 2.0 and will rapidly regress.

              we have a similar agreement being pushed though here in the eu named 'ttip', which is between ourselves and usa. it's all part of a larger deal going on under the acronym 'tafta', basically a huge play area for corporations -

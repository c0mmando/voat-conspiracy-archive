            When they try to shut down Voat they won’t bring up the the actual content of the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will use buzz words like racism and anti-semitism.
           </p>
           <p>
            They won’t show articles or threads about how 13% or wooden doors and chimneys that were installed after the fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will point out all the articles that say how stupid niggers are or how ugly kikes are and will play on the feels of the ignorant and the SJW types who will support them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rights need to be used responsibly or some cunt will try to take them away.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Voat ever gets out of quarantine they will come for this place like they have every other site that doesn’t censor the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            My concern is the shills and ignorant are giving them ammo to do it quite easily.

               Rights are inherent in being a person.  They are not "taken away".  "Taken away" implies that the government grants these rights.  They are "given up", "suppressed", or lost (in the case of violating other people's rights).
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               "responsibility" implies that we have to walk on egg shells or it gives justification to authoritarian types.  The real issue is that the mob does not recognize rights and has been brainwashed. This means that those of us who recognize our rights are always on the defensive, and that any false flag or provocateur can cost us in terms of liberty.

             <p>

              I’m saying be smart, we are in a war and we know the enemies tactics and play book by heart yet we’re walking right into their traps.

              <p>
               Correct.  But on the flip side, why is it that we always lose liberties when these events happen?  Bad people do bad things, but the narrative is always "Bad person did a bad thing with x.  We should outlaw x.".  Why do people fall for this stupid scripted narrative all the time?  Why do the rest of us have to be careful of every mistep?
              </p>
              <p>
               Common sense says that you should respect the rights and wishes of others when possible.  The point is that its NOT about "responsibility".  "Responsibility" implies something totally different than "rights".  The issue is that the brainwashed public has lost the concept of right and wrong.

                You’re preaching to the choir my friend.

                I agree with everything you’re saying but self evident facts are apparently not that evident to the masses nowadays.

                I’m not 100% convinced the guy with the rifle was a false flag, like we see with all the hate speech on this site there are people who are so selfish, short sighted and full of self righteousness that they will flaunt their rights even though it gives the enemy the ammo they need to take it away all the while believing they are doing nothing wrong and nothing can touch them.

            Kinda like how Lincoln forced the shut down of 300 newspapers
            <em>
             IN THE NORTH
            </em>
            during his Civil War. Can’t let reasonable dissent have a voice.

<p>Let\'s pause here and look at the Chicago Cubs.  They get <strong>no</strong> subsidies and <strong>have to</strong> pay property taxes like the rest of us faggots.  This is how it should be right?  
</p>
<p>Up until 2008, the white sox paid <strong>NO</strong> rent.  I repeat, NO RENT and the taxpayers payed to build them a stadium.  Thank god someone at IFSA had some common sense and they convinced the white sox to pay a laughable $1.2 million per year.  Now if this wasn\'t enough, in 2010 \'Jewry Reinsdorf\' decided that wasn\'t enough for him and convinced the now criminal, Rod Blagovich, to have the taxpayers build him a restaurant across the street from the stadium.  
</p>
<p>Again, the reinsdorf\'s get to keep all the profits and nothing goes back to the people that actually paid for it.  
</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune asked why he\'d agree to these terms, Thompson replied, &quot;We said to Jerry, \'Jerry, can we have part of the profits?\' And he said, no. We said, OK. I\'ve known Jerry for 52 years. He\'s tough. He\'s tough.&quot; &lt;-- talk about lucky larry silverstien luck!  
</p>
<p>This fucking familiy is the opitimy of the double standard happening in this country.  Fuck them, more people need to know what a shitbag group of people they are.  I personally believe the citizens of illinois should file a class action lawsuit against jerry reinsdorf and former gov thompson.  This is why america is not great anymore.</p>',

          <p>
           <p>
            I'm going to play devil's advocate here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to moderate a public minecraft server which had a strict policy against racism and hate speech, homophobia, sexism, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone used the word "faggot" in global chat on the server, they'd be kicked pretty much instantly with a warning. If they did it again, they'd get a ban for a set number of days. Say the word "nigger" and you pretty much get an instant ban for a set number of days. etc. It was a policy that I agreed with, since bigotry of any kind really had no place on a game server for playing blocks. On a few occasions I banned players for bigotry without warning them, because it was a low effort deal and it felt like i was doing a public service - though i realized later i should have warned first, I want to make it clear that it was
            <em>
             easy
            </em>
            to justify to myself at the time that it happened the quick response. It was because I was fighting against racism or bigotry and discrimination. I even kicked someone for making jokes about jewish people being greedy once despite his claiming to be jewish himself. Rules were rules, they were for the public benefit.
           </p>
           <p>
            So now placing myself in the shoes of this
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askhistorians">
             /r/askhistorians
            </a>
            moderator, I could see potentially how a similar mindset could cause something like this to happen. Neo-nazis and trolls posting overtly racist comments with no intention of promoting meaningful discussion may have bothered this moderator or all moderators there in the past and created a hypersensitivity, especially since it's a history related subreddit and every time he holocaust comes up you know someone is going to come in and claim it never happened, or that hitler had the right idea, or that the jews were responsible for world war 2, etc. things which may or may not have some truth to them, but which on the surface appear purely inflammatory and intended to promote outrage and angry responses - and often do provoke such drama and flame wars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reading the comment the user made from a neutral viewpoint, not knowing the exact context, I can believe it is a reasonable and mature effort at participating in the conversation with no harmful intentions. Reading it from the perspective of a tired moderator, accustomed to removing racist remarks and encountering trolls who like to push on the rules and try to get away with as much as they can, I can understand it being interpreted as just such an incident, someone playing at being reasonable when they're actually trying to paint jewish people as evil etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            My intention here is not purely to excuse the moderator for his or her actions. It is to offer a cautionary word to not assume that things like this are always purely persecution and domination by israel or jewish interests. Now maybe this really was a case of someone like bipolarbear or davidreiss666 being a bitch in his little sphere of influence. But we should be cautious in what conclusions we draw from incidents like these.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless of the intentions of the moderator, this should serve as an indicator that political-correctness is something that can be a danger to important discussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             tl;dr
            </strong>
            : this mod might not be anti-truth, it could be someone just trying to enforce the rules. regardless, we should be aware of the potential dangers of "political-correctness".

            I'm sorry, I don't get this hatred for reddit mods as a group. I know that some moderators on reddit have done some pretty bad things, but anyone can be a moderator on reddit, or on voat, and I would be willing to bet that over 90% of the moderators on reddit actually took the job with honorable intentions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Full disclosure: I moderate several mildly popular gaming subreddits related to the elder scrolls franchise, and a ton of subreddits I created for project ideas but which I never worked on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is not all reddit mods, it is more complex than that. We should be mindful of oversimplifications tied with emotive responses.

             It's the same thing that the feminazis and PC brigade do, label you a misogynist or a racist if you dare to question their ideology. For most people fear of getting falsely accused will make them self-censor. The Jews have been doing this pretty much ever since the inception of the Israeli state and they're damn good at it. Being labelled an anti-semite in the US is pretty much career ending, regardless of whether you actually said anything offensive or not.

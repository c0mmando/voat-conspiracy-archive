<p>It seems like Adam Schiff is in some major shit, as Q has likely hinted that Adam Schiff is connected to the major pedo ring busted in California with over 500 arrests this week mostly in the district of Adam Schiff... Where we also have three people connected to luxury hotel in his district in West Hollywood that have dies in a helicopter crash.</p>
<p>Not only that but Adam Schiff is directly connected to the FBI\'s malnipulation and lies about the major FISA memo that will expose the Obama administration\'s illegal spy ring through FISA on President Trump and thousands of Americans. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adam Schiff is involved in the FBI FISA memo malnipulation and is even in contact with FBI members trying to prevent the release, and the five FBI agents who got ahold of it in the White House with FBI Director Wray\'s likely permission. </p>

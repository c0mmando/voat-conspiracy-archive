            There's a paradigm of educational thought that sometimes gets called the 'Standardized Management Paradigm' by curriculum scholars. This is the paradigm that more or less ruled the public school system of most developed countries from the post-world-war era until very recently (and reigns supreme in many places still). The Standardized Management Paradigm is based off the industrial model which assumes that children, just like machinery, are completely interchangeable and can all be taught the exact same thing in the exact same way. Any deviation from the expected outcomes is presumed to be a failure on the part of the student, not on the part of the teaching method, curriculum, or any of the systemic factors involved. Differing from the expected norm is considered a bad thing, a defect. It promotes conformity and punishes creativity and expression. Under this model, the curriculum is a pre-determined thing that is presumed to be known in its entirety and is taught to a captive audience of children who are presumed to have no knowledge or ability of their own and are just there to passively absorb the 'thing' that is the curriculum. Once again, this is the model that has prevailed in much of the developed world, and still prevails intensely in a lot of places. It produces nice little cogs who know how to follow instructions but can't think for themselves or problem solve. They can handle textbook situations but nothing more advanced than that, because it's heavily compartmentalized and there's not a lot of interdisciplinary collaboration. In fact, interdisciplinary collaboration is discouraged in a kind of academic subject fence pissing match which considers only those disciplines valuable to STEM to be worthy of note. Anything involving human experience is systematically devalued in favour of STEM subjects.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good news is that there are other forms of thought in curriculum design, such as
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3S_Understanding">
             Curricular Wisdom
            </a>
            . Curricular Wisdom is incredibly effective at getting kids engaged, learning, and thinking critically about information, and it doesn't penalize the non-conformists like Standardized Management does. It's not predicated on a teacher-as-a-master model but on a teacher-as-a-collaborator. The problem with Curricular Wisdom and other similar humanistic models is that it's labour intensive for the teacher - it requires that the teacher be trained in the paradigm (most teachers were educated in the Standardized Management Paradigm and thus mindlessly
            <em>
             repeat
            </em>
            the Standardized Management Paradigm), deeply internalize the values, and spend the time to plan curricula under this paradigm. Applying it in the classroom is difficult to do with a large class or in an underfunded classroom.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ballooning class sizes, underfunded education system, overworked, underpaid teaching staff, and lack of support staff are no mere oversight or error. It's a deliberately designed setup that basically guarantees that the only possible teaching style will be Standardized Management, because it can be easily churned out and mass produced and fits well with standardized testing. It ensures that those who are deemed as valid of entry into society in general are all trained in exactly the same way with exactly the same narrow range of opinions and thoughts, and that those who 'fail to conform' to the standard remain marginalized throughout their lives. Applying something that works, like Curriculum Wisdom, and that actually benefits learners, on a national or even district scale would cost money, resources, and require that we respect teaching as a profession and support teachers a lot more than we do. It would also require significant retraining of the current teaching staff. For stressed out, underpaid teachers with little support, the only easily available tools they can reach for and keep using year after year are Standardized Management tools. Standardized Management virtually ensures its own continuance, and is also easily manipulated by a few interests setting the 'standards' for curricula.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't read
            <em>
             The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America
            </em>
            but I probably should. I'm a teacher in training, and I know if there's one thing I don't want to do it's mindlessly replicate the model of our intellectual oppression.

            I don't think it was standardised testing. I think it was the dumbing down of the education system as a whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            How can you possibly learn if teachers aren't allowed to tell you where you went wrong?
           </p>
           <p>
            And in order to pass the required amount of students each year, they keep moving the goalposts to make it easier and easier for subsequent generations.

             It should be noted that the author of Deliberate Dumbing Down, Charlotte Iserbyt was/is a frequent guest of Alex Jones and her father and grandfather were Skull and Bones members. She has though on many occasions divulged Skull and Bones secrets so I believe her to be on our team but I'm just making sure this is out in the open because I know a lot of people think Jones and some of his guests are cointel/shills. I am not in the least bit trying to discredit the contents of this book. I think this thread has very important information everyone needs to read, especially teachers and those in the education industry.

<p>The media exposes us to ridiculous hyperbole, from both the liberal media and conservative media, and the middle ground of actual facts (what\'s left when you get rid of the emotional outbursts) seems to be disappearing. Our information-spheres on the most important issues are being reduced to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-7mQhSZRgM">&quot;Dueling Carls&quot;</a> sort of situation. </p>
<p>Pick a side and get mad, or shut the fuck up. That\'s what the establishment wants. That\'s what the extremists who follow their particular flavor of the establishment want. The brainwashed. The media. All trying to take over our natural culture and drown it out with control mechanisms, through emotionally-driven hyperbole. It\'s a brain-hack to control a hundred million people, to override their ability to think with a culture of poisonous outrage that perfectly pushes their well-cultivated buttons. </p>
<p>They\'ve made it so that the whole country is constantly triggered by important stuff. &quot;Trump&quot; is a triggering word, people instantly get emotional upon hearing or reading that word. This emotionality (be it positive or negative) keeps us from talking about the issues, because our emotional brains override our logical brains, and it can take minutes or hours to calm down enough to see things logically again. We\'re left in &quot;libtard snowflake&quot; mode or &quot;small-handed orange man is racist&quot; mode. Do you feel that twinge in your gut as you read those phrases? Do you feel yourself getting defensive? This means it is working, this emotion is the foot-in-the-door to ownership of your consciousness. </p>
<p>If what\'s left of our organic culture is replaced with a interwoven network of knee-jerk reactions driven by emotional responses, hyped up and reinforced across hundreds of millions of people by hyperbolistic media, then how do we fix it? </p>
<p>We detach from the media that no longer serves us or our interests. We detach from the media that generate our outrage that allows us to be so easily controlled. </p>
<p>Having this emotional distance doesn\'t mean you don\'t care about the issues, it simply means you don\'t let the emotions overwhelm you. Which in turn helps you understand the issues better. It is freeing yourself from the bondage of having well-crafted buttons for others to push, do not mistake this for callousness. </p>
<p>Every time we are presented with something to be outraged about, we must ask ourselves: There are ten million things to be sad about in this very moment in time, does this one actually matter in the scope of what is accomplishable? Is it getting us anything to be mad about this? Are we building consensus toward solution, or simply driving people who should be cooperating further apart? </p>
<p>Outrage is a powerful tool. Use it wisely and carefully, don\'t let it hijack you but instead use to chose it for yourself, because we only have so much if it. If we over-express outrage we as individuals, and even collectively as a society, can run in to outrage fatigue and then we become impotent. If our communal outrage gets eaten up by nonsense, then there\'s nothing left for the important issues. Worse off, they may get overlooked entirely in lieu of spending time beating up on strawmen versions of the other side. </p>
<p>&quot;Anybody can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way - that is not within everybody\'s power and is not easy.&quot;  - Aristotle</p>',

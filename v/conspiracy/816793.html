It must be true. No doubt.&quot; A whistleblower, overnight becoming a celebrity the likes of which the world has never seen before, with worldwide coverage of his story that kept audiences befuddled. His leaks to be uncovered and discussed for months and years to come. The story of the man himself captivated people. Bond-like tales of plane-hopping and evading detection, secret meetings with journalists, putting cell phones in the freezer, because &quot;they&quot; can hear you. The world has divided in opinion: is he a hero or a traitor? A whistleblower becoming a worldwide celebrity, the world\'s first... Knowing what I know, it made me wonder.</p>
<p>If &quot;they&quot; wished the story to be forgotten and swept under the rug, within a week no one would have remembered who Edward Snowden was, because the next big story on TV has already captured everyone\'s attention. And one would think that, for a government agency to have its secrets leaked would be a good enough reason to do everything in its power to bury the story. Yet, here we are, soon to be three years after Snowden\'s story broke, and he is still subject to periodical news stories, and a worldwide celebrity, receiving awards and giving talks.</p>
<p>And then it hit me. I, being keenly aware of the global agendas and their methods, have fallen for one of the greatest tricks that has ever been pulled off. I was preaching of the intentional fear mongering to keep us all enslaved, and how we shouldn\'t be succumbed to their tricks, all the while completely erradicating my online presence and limiting my own right to free speech and expression because of fear implanted in me by the Snowden leaks.

<p>There are certainly many good things that came out of the Snowden leaks.

While we should protect our personal data, we must not become passive onlookers because of fear of surveillance, for that is the ultimate agenda: to shut up anyone who has something to say. We must stand up to the oppression and be proud of our thoughts, our deeds, and our rights. Our minds and spirits shall not be crippled.</p>',

             Which group has access to chemical and nuclear weapons? There's your answer. Though the biggest weapon available is control over institutions that define our state of existence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Humans don't exhibit behavior that hints at their ability to recognize change in their environment anymore. Technology has made many aspects of working and participating in society obsolete, but we still remain chained to such methods regardless of the actual need to go through such motions.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are cattle, so our actual stopping power is stifled by our inability to do anything outside of what we were raised to do. We need to start educating ourselves on the sly. We need to start feeding eachother good food for free (since we aren't allowed to make money from untainted food). We cut out some very powerful middle men if we take advantage of the knowledge laying at our feet.
            </p>
            <p>
             More than just a few of us needs be awake for that big number to mean anything.

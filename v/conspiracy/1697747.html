<p>Part of me is upset about this and the way it\'s being done, but another part of me has seen that these regulatory bodies have been partially if not fully captured by the companies they\'re meant to regulate. The first Chief Administrator of the EPA was a Monsanto board member. <a href="https://muckrakingmaven.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/monsanto_federal_positions.png">https://muckrakingmaven.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/monsanto_federal_positions.png</a></p>
<p>Regulatory capture has been a long-time problem with US regulatory agencies, on both sides of the aisle: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/emAcFyM.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/emAcFyM.jpg</a></p>
<p>Regulation is not bad of course, and is often very good and important, but if the governmental regulatory bodies are run by the same companies that the regulation is meant to protect us from, then it often works opposite to its intended goal, or may use the stated regulatory goal to consolidate an existing monopoly.</p>
<p>All that being said, the way Trump\'s administration is going about it is very ham-fisted and is causing all sorts of problems. Doing things in such a sudden and shocking manner is very disruptive, he did the same thing with the immigration ban of 7 countries. It seems like he is stirring up problems in the name of justice, which is ironically exactly what some of these regulatory agencies and lobbyists are doing. The EPA isn\'t all bad by any means, but there is a serious problem with revolving door between industry and regulation, something which is banned in most developed countries. Although ultimately I doubt Trump will actually fix this root issue (despite playing off of it to gain support) and will probably only make it worse. I\'d love to be happily surprised by being proven wrong though.</p>',

            It's possible. I think he's just going to make america great for his friends, not for the American people. But there's a small chance you could be right.

             you are thinking small picture.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not about money, this is about getting your name in the history books. Anyone can get rich. It is not hard. Staying rich is the hard part.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump could do that, no problem. He had a TV show, resorts, plenty of assets. He could stay rich by not changing. So why go to all the trouble for a shit job?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why run during the 2016 elections?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because this is an interesting time. Keep in mind he used to be a democrat, and that the democrats did not have a fracturing tea party event until last year. Too many people have started hating the democrat party over the last 30 years. They got red pilled and either went to the right, or became libertarian.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump capitalized on this. Hollywood and the music industry are at their weakest, the msm is at their weakest. The parties are at their weakest. All it takes is a loud person with a drastic plan to get elected.
            </p>
            <p>
             So trump now has caught the tiger by the tail, so what is he going to do? He is going to make america great again. how? By dismantling everything wrong with the system. He is going to destroy the nasty elements in the democrat AND republican parties.
            </p>
            <p>
             Think about that. What would happen to a person who reforms ALL of the US, including both parties, and the Economy? This goes beyond money, this goes into a real history book legacy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone is weak, so weak that he can do this.
            </p>

           I've seen "Disclosure" and wasn't impressed at all. He keeps talking about alien tech, anti-gravity, forms of free energy etc... But he never shows any proof of it. Now Tyler (from secureteam10) got an early screening from Greer's new documentary because he is a supposed "fan" of secureteam10.

           I have a feeling that secureteam10 is compromised.
The comment section is filled with lame comments about drinking coffee because the vid was uploaded early, being late at work because watching Tyler &gt; work and other random comments instead of actual discussions on the topic. Worst is, these irrelevant comments are being liked to the points that they are all top comments. Aka shills are distracting us from the real deal.

          <p>
           Also the fact that they advertise using iTunes to distribute the documentary (Unacknowledged) is literally a big joke.

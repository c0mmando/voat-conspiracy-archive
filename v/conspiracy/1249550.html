It began earlier this month when Hugo Salinas Price noticed that the reserves of Central Banks around the world had declined by a trillion dollars. Central Banks had dumped a trillion dollars in US government bonds in the 17 months ending January 8, 2016. Normally that kind of fire sale of assets would have taken down the US and global economies.</p>
<p>Another billionaire had an answer. Rob Kirby said the US Exchange Stabilization Fund bought that trillion dollars in bonds. The Exchange Stabilization Fund was created in 1934. It is above the law and any Congressional oversight. The CIA has been subject to Congressional investigation but never the ESF. It was initially funded when FDR asked Americans to turn in their gold coins that were valued at $20.67 per ounce. The dollar was devalued to $35 which gave the ESF a paper profit of $2.8 billion. The Treasury Secretary appointed a manger for the ESF. The first man to run the ESF was Harry Dexter White who worked closely with Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. Soviet documents proved that White was a Soviet spy. White served on 18 government boards including the one that ran OSS Black Ops financing. He sent $50 million to China in 1940 to fund the war against Japan.</p>
<p>White also helped create the IMF and the World Bank. He won the battle with John Maynard Keynes to make the US Dollar the worldâ€™s reserve currency at Bretton Woods in 1944. This had severe ramifications for the Dollar and later might have became one of the reasons why President Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
<p>The ESF took over Black Ops financing for the CIA when it replaced the OSS. In 1948  the ESF delivered $10 million in cash which CIA handed out to politicians in Italy to make sure the â€˜Good Guysâ€™ won the elections. The ESF funded regime change all over the world. And when it came time to import heroin from the Golden Triangle to the US during the Vietnam war, the ESF was there along side Air America.</p>
<p>In the 1960s the American Dollar was experiencing problems. Wall Street had decided to over populate the country so America had to run deficits to pay for the importing of raw materials that were not needed when the population was only 150 million people. The US was also supporting hundreds of military bases overseas and funding regime change. The ESF developed a work around through the IMF to pay for military coups and counter revolutions. The ESF would front the coup leaders cash which was subsequently written up as an IMF loan. The ESF would ask that these loans be paid back in foreign currencies so the US Treasury through the New York Federal Reserve Bank and its 21 primary dealers could manipulate currencies to make the dollar look good.</p>
<p>Other sources of income for the ESFâ€™s market manipulations of gold and currencies were the illegal drug and weapons trade. It was the ESF through the CIA that set up the infrastructure for the major Drug Cartels. My regular readers know that the Big Banks launder a trillion dollars a year in illegal drugs and weapons sales. They also launder $500 billion a year in political bribes.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1963 President Kennedy had decided to change the way international monetary policy was conducted to cure our continual trade deficits. He wanted to bring in foreign countries and to make the operations of the ESF, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department transparent and open to public inspection. This decision died with JFKâ€™s assassination. President Kennedy was killed on the 53rd anniversary of the first meeting held in 1910 to draft the legislation that became the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Other reasons given for the assassination of JFK were his opposition to Israelâ€™s acquisition of nuclear weapons. And some wanted the US to go into the Vietnam war and lose it so we could hook the younger generation on drugs and make trillions of dollars from the addicts and the systematic destruction of our cities.</p>
<p>Let me close with something I have not said for awhile.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Fact of Your Existence as a modern man or woman is that the bankers of New York and London want to reduce you to Debt Slavery.</p>
<p>Accept that fact and move on to the solution.</p>
<p>That is their plan for you.</p>
<p>What is your plan for them?</p>

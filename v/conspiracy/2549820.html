            Solar is the way. Plants have been living on the sun for billions of years. You would think the most intelligent beings on the planet should be able to figure out one way or another too do the same thing.

             It's not exactly the same thing. This is a fraud being sold as "green emerging tech". If they never would have created the climate change agenda and the push for "green energy", we would never have wind farmed the planet like we are doing now. Simply because it is not an economical nor an ecological way to produce energy.
            </p>
            <p>
             With nuclear energy we mostly know what we are getting. With wind energy there is a huge campaign of misinformation and effort to paper over the downsides. If there were no downsides, as it's being marketed, it wouldn't be such a huge problem. But the fact is it's affecting communities and people where they are installed, that is the real problem. In addition to that we then pay extra for this pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where I live for example, they have installed country-wide one of the world's biggest industrial wind turbines. Our electricity bills have gone up as a result. And not only that, it's affecting the people who live too close to the farms too, because the noise modeling they are doing on the farms, is constructed using statistical fraud. They have bribed the community decision makers, and in many cases bribed the communities with false promises.
            </p>
            <p>
             People who investigate the operators later, only find shell companies with empty offices. Tax payer money being shuffled elsewhere, and controlled by a collective group of lobbyists.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't buy this crap for a second. And the worst thing is the pollution free part of the wind farms is the biggest fraud. The part that was supposed to be the biggest boon of these mills, turns out to be the biggest lie of them.

               It's a problem we can do without. That is the point. We can't do without coal, we can't do without nuclear power, we can't do without the trucking industry. It is sold to us as something that is necessary. It's not.
              </p>
              <p>
               And not only that, they are hiding the problems, making it difficult for the industry and legislators to fix and improve things, even if we wanted to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nuclear, coal, trucking, fishing, logging, we mostly know what the problems are with all of these, and we constantly improve them.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's like flu vaccines. "They're great. Everyone NEEDS them.". "Never mind the problems, never mind that you can become injured for life, they're perfectly safe and we don't need to change anything. Just send us your tax dollars.".
              </p>
              <p>
               Wind power is a very similar mindset.

            The wind power lobby organization is like the AIPAC of the world. They terrorize the planet and the people by lobbying politicians and selling their "green dream" to communities and countries. Wind power is neither green nor effective. The industrial wind farms are enormous projects, with enormous subsidies by our governments. Forests need to be cut down, steel, concrete, rare earth elements, and environmentally disastrous glass fiber materials are used in huge quantities. All shipped from China, burning fossil fuels or other energy sources.

            The wind power industry couldn't run profitable for a second, without pick pocketing every citizen on this planet every day. It's all a big fat lie, in order to line the pockets of the disaster capitalist wind power industry with our money.

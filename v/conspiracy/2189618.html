             Of course I'm not saying have it hover right outside the window.  What I'm saying is there should have been one at a reasonably far distance, in a low hover, lights out, with a telescopic FLIR camera gathering intel.  They knew what hotel room it was at that point.  They knew the shooting had stopped.  All there was to gain at All these metro police helis have them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Example:
             <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=SaOhD2r-Y8c">
              https://hooktube.com/watch?v=SaOhD2r-Y8c
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             There was a ton of time that elapsed between when the shooter allegedly shot himself and when they breached the room.   At the very least they would have wanted to check to see if they could detect any movement inside prior to breach the room.  Not to mention they should have been scanning all the nearby rooftops for other shooters.  Gathering intel from different vantage points is just standard procedure in a tactical situation like that.  I don't know if they had one airborne that night but the definitely should have.

              Ok, but has anyone said they saw one? I understand all of the things it could offer and hinder to the situation. The question to ask before we ask about helicopter footage is whether one was even there.

               I remember seeing a post about news helicopters being asked to stay clear of the area but I haven't seen anything about law enforcement helis.specifically.  But yeah, that's what I was asking in my post title.  I can only assume lv police were competent enough to have one in the air that night and if there was, I'd really like to see the footage.  I've seen all these different theories floating around about what went down in that room before and after the police arrived and if there's any footage from that perspective I think it would answer some questions.

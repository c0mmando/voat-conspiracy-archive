            Initially a few marked patrolcars show up, but there is nothing going on, and they take a look around. They go inside, see nothing out of the ordinary, then leave, radioing in that it is a wild goose chase. The prank calls do not stop and it is assumed from background noise that it is someone at the club, so the plan is to SWAT up and bust down the door in "show of force" to teach them a lesson, bust a few skulls, and arrest somebody. On their way to the raid see the guy with the gun, and then overreact. 12 man swat team with grenades, SMGs, autoShotguns and M4s (300-400 rounds) unloaded on him and caused the unnecessary loss of life on everyone in his general direction. The SWAT using full metal jacket military grade ammo, were able to kill and maim many who were on the other side of the concrete.

            Orlando PD was targeted in a NSA "swatting" prank attack that targeted the club. The SWAT team showed up and accidentally killed a few dozen, wounded a few dozen more. At some point, omar, being a defense contractor had his gear with him and becoming aware of the police presence, and a possible attack on the club he was in, got his gun and tried to defend. He was set up, the swat shows up and see this one sand bag standing outside with a rifle, and they put 1+1 together, assume he is the shooter that the prank "swatting" call was talking about, and started shooting up everything. He runs inside to take cover and they keep shooting, throw flashbangs, and accidentally cause the biggest mass murder "hate-crime" in the US history. In order to prevent a general riot, the police and FBI act quick, and paste together a "lone-wolf" package straight out of the training manuals to protect the integrity of the police department, the FBI, their death squads, and the mass surveillance state.

             Why would he shoot at the police? If he was a defence contractor, he'd simply lie on the ground with his hands behind his back as he would know that sudden movements would get him killed.

             He also sold his house to his relatives for $10...you don't do that normally:

             You wouldn't just do those things unless you were planning something.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am not doubting that the SWAT team killed a bunch of people. Maybe he got scared and didn't want to go ahead with the act? And his handlers just nudged him along. A lone wolf wouldn't be able to hold that much ammo and kill that many people.

              Typically you listen to Armed Gunmen whether or not they are police? He could have been ordered to put down his rifle, and then they said "now throw down your side-arm" and then when he touches the gun they can all together testify that he pointed it at them when he went to throw it away?  I was saying that he didnt shoot at them at all. On the otherhand, they practiced the age old law enforcement of "shoot first" and "cover it up later".

              someone else using his identity? but it is that hard for them to create a paper trail after the fact. Especially when he is dead and cannot say otherwise. I would assume he would have this gear from GS4 and would not need to buy lower grade than what he was using at work.

              He got married again and held on to his own money after the trouble with the first wife? It was a sham marriage? or he had an upcoming "black-bag" operation at GS4 and needed to take care of this formality.

             do these events support the consolidation of all NATO members into the EU? You know that Turkey is one of largest NATO members and as part of the joining of the EU will be asked to leave nato because they are under US command there.

             Notice how videos from Turkey were on the internet very soon after the bombings?  Apparently nobody in Orlando, San Bernardino, or Roseburg Oregon has a phone with a camera on it.

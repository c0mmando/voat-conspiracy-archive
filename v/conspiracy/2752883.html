</p>
<p>Real goats, do not be blinded by the propaganda.  All they are trying to do is evoke emotion out of us because it\'s becoming crystal clear to the world that these people are simply committing fraud on a mass scale and every citizen on this planet has been footing the bill.

<li>syrians and palestinians are not the problem</li>
<li>black american\'s are not the problem</li>
<li>white people are not the problem</li>
<li>trump is not America\'s friend</li>
<li>hillary is not America\'s friend</li>
<li>NO FUCKING POLITICIAN IN THIS SYSTEM IS LOOKING OUT FOR OUR INTERESTS </li>
<li><strong>Q is not real</strong></li>
<li>there is no republican party and there is no democratic party, it\'s a fucking sham</li>
<li>Mass election fraud was committed during the 2016 election and basically both sides of the aisle would probably be in jail with the mass media included if people just focused.</li>
<li>All the congressional and senate hearings are nothing more than political theatre</li>
<li>the propaganda push here is to make us believe that people still give two fucks about this.  the real stories get drowned out with mass media propaganda paid for with our \'TAX DOLLARS\'</li>
<li>china is not the enemy</li>
<li>russia is not the enemy</li>
<li>the arabs are not the enemy</li>
</ol>
<p>The problem exists only in the financial and political structure that WE all <strong>allow</strong> these people to keep us under.  While we see a flood of mass political propaganda no different then when the 2016 election happened.  Old goats will remember that, it\'s happening n; yet another mass flood of \'refugees\' that dominate our front pages with nothing but the same political propaganda that the main stream fucking media is pushing.  These faggots will all be gone when the mid terms disappear, nothing different than tommy robinson and patrick little.

<p>They are nothing more than <strong><em>fire-starters</em></strong> trying to invoke outrage and agent provactuers with an intent to divide and keep any real unity in small groups. </p>
<p><strong><em>emotion and actions based on emotion is the only trick left in their bag to dillute the truth.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Real change comes when the people realize that regardless of the color we are, sex, region of the world we live in, we are all getting royally fucked.  So, the best way to battle these faggots is to not give in to their manipulations to get your emotions riled up.  That\'s when your valid argument loses all credibility. That\'s all they have left, to mask the truth based on emotion.  the old, \'he may be right, but he\'s an asshole\' trick.</p>
<p>Think about it, the mass flood of Jew hate propaganda is most likely going to be used as an effort to further regulate social media, trump already started this with the facebook and google scandal.  If there are actual Q believers that aren\'t sitting in an AIPAC or IDF social media battle room, get a mother fucking grip and start to believe in changing our world for the better and that means by doing something other than looking at retarded riddles.  
</p>
<p>AND if all else fails, just call them a <em>silly faggot</em> and move on.  you know these new accounts will be gone after the elections are over.</p>',

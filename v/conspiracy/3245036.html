            She was a dumb slut who liked to be abused. All nigger singers sound pretty much the same.

            She was very pretty and she sang really well, but she was a crack addict. You can't forget that fact. You only know what the music industry showed you.

            Her daughter was going to try to take up the mantle she left, and well, she "killed" herself too.  I've long thought she was killed just like Michael.  You aren't wrong, the Black community is driven by music more than any other subject.  It's a tribal thing. You likely aren't too far off on this subject.  I remember when she stopped the drugs and started to record again. My racist Granny, and I mean she called niggers "colored people" and niggers to their face even, would love to listen to Whitney Houston. She went on and on about how she was upset she took to drugs. Granted this was years ago now and before she OD'd.  She was the only Nigger female Artist my racist granny would listen too and she even wanted her music played at her funeral.  She was classy enough to get my racist grandmother to listen and root for her. You know they had to stop it when they got the most racist southerners listening and cheering her on.

             That's right. This is so absurd that I can think about this only now, when it's obvious that the studios want the black music as much degenerated as they can. When she died, I was clueless because black music was still good. Even rappers were making funny or intelligent songs. Now it's only shitty gangsta rap.

<p>One anti-corruption organization, represent.us, suggests the solution is to focus on sorting out local and state governments, and then the effects will ripple upwards.

</p>
<p>So while the anti-corruption bill by represent.us <em>seems</em> good on the face of it, the reality of the bill is that it was a power grab under the auspices of being an anti-corruption bill for the public good.

This means we have the leftist billionaires vs the rightist billionaires, both pretending to act in the benefit of the people, both vying for power over state and local governments. </p>
<p>A second example: WolfPAC, started in 2011. It proposes to solve the problem with a constitutional amendment that is passed via state resolutions, rather than by congress. There are two ways to make a new constitutional amendment: 2/3 of each house of Congress can vote to propose an amendment, which is how it\'s usually done, or 2/3 of the states (34 states) can independently pass a resolution calling for a national convention to add an amendment. Then, ratification requires 3/4 of the states (38 states) to vote in support of an amendment before it becomes part of the Constitution. No congressional approval needed. The president can\'t veto it. This is true direct democracy. </p>
<p>Vetting is needed to know if the WolfPAC resolution is genuinely anti-corruption or if it\'s pushed by billionaires looking to use it as a power grab, as is the case with represent.us. However they have managed to pass their resolution in 5 states already. </p>
<p>America is heavily divided about a wide number of things, so proposing something that has broad support is difficult. It would have to be worded in a way that 3/4 of Americans approve of it, even in the face of twisted propaganda against it that would inevitably arise from the mainstream media to defend the establishment. So it would have to be very simple, without a lot of extras or baggage, and very direct. Then it has to be promoted. The media presence would be the trickiest part, most likely, because we wouldn\'t have billionaire help and the mainstream media would likely be working against us. </p>
<p>If a good simple bill could be written, proper buzz could be generated about it, and some state votes were called, with enough attempts it could be passed in enough states to eventually amend the constitution. Or, get the laws changed on the state level so the effects ripple upward. Both approaches can be used in tandem, the state bill can be a slightly modified version of the state resolution. </p>
<p>If you believe in the possibility of this approach, please spread the word.</p>

            To get any of that stuff for the system you want you first have to kill the things currently infesting it. We had more than 1 founding father who said to repeat those bloody revolutions about every 20 years or so. What could possibly have been the reasoning?

            If you want a constitutional amendment that could fix the two party voting system, here's a possibility:
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of only being able to vote for one person, have each voter rate each candidate individually. I'd rate on a scale from 100% approval, to -100% (complete disapproval), and 0 being total indifference. Any candidate not listed or rated on the ballet the voter turns in defaults to 0. Whoever has the highest average rating wins. This would remove the excuse of being the lesser of two evils from the list of reasons to vote for a candidate.

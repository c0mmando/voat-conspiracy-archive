            This is a good point that I hadn't actually considered. I got too wrapped up in confirmation bias. I'm not the type of person to immediately jump to the false flag explanation of terrible events, but nevertheless, I hadn't considered that the rape epidemic could be a manipulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I
            <em>
             had
            </em>
            considered that the rapes were planned by tptb. As in, men from a culture that permits what western people would call abuse against women are imported into a country for some nefarious purpose, and allowed to clash with the native culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I hadn't even considered that the attacks might not have happened as per the common narrative.

            There is a video of the cologne attack, but I didn't watch it.

            There are probably other videos online of that kind of thing, but I've never looked into it because that would be fucked up to watch.

             i just googled cologne attack video - there are a lot of people claiming to post videos of it but really they're being given videos from other events - I haven't found a video of Cologne attacks yet. 
The first link below doesn't actually have a video, but has another video of immigrants shooting guns and fireworks.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             This second link again only has a still from what I assume should be a video, but no video. It has another video which could actually be immigrants (whether they're muslim or not is arguable) attacking a woman, but takes place in France without a verifiable date.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             This is manufactured propganda to keep you focused on muslim migrants as the economy tanks and government and financial families squeeze the last bit of wealth out of our societies.

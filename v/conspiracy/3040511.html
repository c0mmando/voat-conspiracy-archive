  'formattedContent' => '<p>Today I was viewing this article <a href="http://archive.fo/awy2y">http://archive.fo/awy2y</a> about how this charter jet company ‘21 Air’ was caught flying weapons to Venezuela. It is based in NJ and was making many local flights, but then appeared to make flights back and forth to Miami starting some months ago. According to the article, 19 rifles and likewise ammo were confiscated by Venezuelans among humanitarian aid. The article also makes a reference to 21 Air’s connection to ‘black sites’ so my interest was piqued.</p>
<p>So I went over to 21 Air’s website <a href="http://archive.fo/wIGqw">http://archive.fo/wIGqw</a> and looked around. Here is their fleet <a href="http://archive.fo/vnilt">http://archive.fo/vnilt</a> they have two cargo jets. On their about me <a href="http://archive.fo/pyw9i">http://archive.fo/pyw9i</a> there are 3 people listed one of which is their “Director of Operations” Dave Norgren. </p>
<p>My fed radar went off immediately when I looked at Dave so I decided to do some searching on him. The only thing that came up was a linkedin <a href="http://archive.fo/yk16P">http://archive.fo/yk16P</a> which I can’t confirm on a picture because refuse to login to linkedin. What I found interesting was the job title  ‘Special Situations’ and the generic company name, ‘Iron Capital.’ Their CEO is Marcelo Fonseca (last name linked to Panama Papers possibly?) on linkedin search.</p>
<p>I did some searching on Iron Capital and this is what I believe it is referring to : <a href="http://archive.fo/1QhuB">http://archive.fo/1QhuB</a> Note the logo <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/iaei6e.png">https://files.catbox.moe/iaei6e.png</a> and its relation to our beloved pizza symbolism. Scrolling down there\'s a picture of this guy <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ycwkn8.png">https://files.catbox.moe/ycwkn8.png</a> and if he isn’t the epitome of a CIA University of Utah recruit, then your last name is McMuffin. Also, they only have two sample “fundeds” and one is a generic CIA name SnacKing Vending, and the other is just generic (((Jewelry Store))). Also, their address has at least 7 offices according to my address searching, and according to my Map views, that building would be very small divided into 7+ plots for something of this ‘alleged’ magnitude. The entire site is funny, like saying they do “0% APR for 21 months” (21air reference?). And only require a 600 credit score – lol. Zero down, no fees = ??? = profit ???</p>
<p>The reviews are powered by ‘YOTPO’ which is for ‘verified real reviews,’ just like how Iron Capital is for ‘Real Businesses.’ All the reviews <a href="http://archive.fo/APNw6">http://archive.fo/APNw6</a> are super generic, and posted very close together date wise. Also, the last review was in 2017. Some of the reviews are even cut off mid sentence like they were written by AI bots. Even weirder, the first time I was scrolling about 2/3 down the page, a weird MKULTRA-like screensaver started pulling down my screen (purply colors looked like a spiral animation was loading) – I moved my mouse immediately because my first thought was to avoid some sort of mind control – call me paranoid whatever - and it went away). I inspected the page elements and couldn’t find anything to replicate it so if you dare go on then please try to screen record and make a webm). If you can find it please let me know. Also, the copyright on the bottom hasn’t been updated since 2017. I’ll leave you to explore the rest of the site and read how poorly done- generic the filler copy is.</p>
<p>Here is their facebook. <a href="http://archive.fo/ISmyi">http://archive.fo/ISmyi</a> 139 likes from other feds and their shitty wix plop shell sites. </p>
<p>Here is their ‘partner’ for ‘real reviews,’ ‘YOTPO’ <a href="http://archive.fo/3qRHO">http://archive.fo/3qRHO</a> Again the website is a bunch of nothing nonsense with no actual product. Actually, I went through their ‘build a loyalty program’ thing and the popup on the right asked me if I wanted to schedule a call at the end and I said no and it just gave me some generic blog posts on their site and that was endgame. Although it redirected me through another company of theirs allegedly (on one of their badges on the site), Swell Rewards. <a href="http://archive.fo/8MEyU">http://archive.fo/8MEyU</a> YOTPO claims to have this address  at YOTPO (33 W. 19th Street, New York, NY 10011). Note the masonic 33. Apparently this building <a href="http://archive.fo/mlfHV">http://archive.fo/mlfHV</a> which imo seems a bit much, and I almost guarantee they don’t reside in this building (these shells usually pick very well known addresses I.e sears tower). Also why would a tech company be in a Chelsea fashion building?</p>
<p>Here is their weird loyalty generator program <a href="http://archive.fo/MIv3C">http://archive.fo/MIv3C</a> <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/wjjs03.png">https://files.catbox.moe/wjjs03.png</a> heres the link since the archive is weird <a href="https://www.yotpo.com/loyalty-program-generator/">https://www.yotpo.com/loyalty-program-generator/</a> Also, its funny that one of their 4 alleged fake locations is in Tel Aviv. </p>
<p>Here <a href="http://archive.fo/VchWN">http://archive.fo/VchWN</a> is info of who works there (note the Swell Rewards CEO is part of the company). Also, they’re nearly all Jews. Note more lazy copy fill with buzzwordy wix garbage. 
<a href="http://archive.fo/NicJe">http://archive.fo/NicJe</a> Here is an example of what they’ve done for “Untuckit” shirts <a href="http://archive.fo/NicJe">http://archive.fo/NicJe</a> which is a load of nothing. 
<a href="http://archive.fo/VchWN">http://archive.fo/VchWN</a> more. I notice the archiving isn’t working well so feel free to explore the sites js before it gets nuked. Also, note the continued symbolism on their page <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/i22lyk.png">https://files.catbox.moe/i22lyk.png</a> <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/cog6m2.png">https://files.catbox.moe/cog6m2.png</a> <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/o7x5ia.png">https://files.catbox.moe/o7x5ia.png</a></p>
<p>BONUS:</p>
<p>I was browsing quickly for a Marcelo Fonseca and stumbled on this article about Mossac Fonseca’s origins. Its the (((Times of Israel))) so take what you want from it <a href="http://archive.fo/Ebdef">http://archive.fo/Ebdef</a> Interesting connections to the Totenkopf SS division. So I scrolled to the comments to read the kevetching and (((Elliot Bernstein))) (Bernstein --- of fucking course right?) <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/jg02v3.png">https://files.catbox.moe/jg02v3.png</a> posts this. I look at the URL and lol. I had to check it out. <a href="http://archive.fo/N0nct">http://archive.fo/N0nct</a> here it is. ‘Where did 6 Million Nazis Go????????’ which is mostly schizophrenic rambling but I found his random inserts about IBM especially interesting regarding ‘access codes’ considering the conspiracy with the Vault Robbery on 9/11 under WTC7 which I believe was secured by IBM at the time…. Then there’s IBMs connections to stealing the facebook code and their fed connections but ill keep that for another post.</p>
<p>I literally just found all this and wrote about it in about 1.5 hours so dig around, archive.fo and post. Hopefully I don\'t get scheduled for suicide.</p>',

           So I went over to 21 Air’s website
           <a href="http://archive.fo/wIGqw">
            http://archive.fo/wIGqw

           and looked around. Here is their fleet

            http://archive.fo/vnilt
           </a>
           they have two cargo jets. On their about me
           <a href="http://archive.fo/pyw9i">

           there are 3 people listed one of which is their “Director of Operations” Dave Norgren.

Then there’s IBMs connections to stealing the facebook code and their fed connections but ill keep that for another post.

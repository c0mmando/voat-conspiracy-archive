            A quote from the Article that sums up the situation and dangers faced by Hugh in Flint MI.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Well, then they had their change. Reuther joined the Communist Party, as a number of them had, and they got out of the Communist Party. They took one route; I took another. They took the route to destroy from within, and I took the route of learning all to destroy from without. So consequently we couldn't even work together. You could understand that. However, when it was all said and done, Reuther got hit----well, they got shot for doing it; they all got killed for doing it, where there was a few of us lived, see. But through this thing I don't suppose I got six inches off my body that isn't cut for a bullet hole or something. There isn't too many of us, but that's what happened with so many of those fellows that joined the Party and got out. For some reason or another, they was liquidated. But you take people like Bud and those boys that didn't get out... Maybe they let it slide; maybe they got to talking, so they just carried on. But they never would come back ever, come back in power. But what glooms me----for the public, not for me---it burns me that all the country knows, and all you read is about those people that were involved in the detriment----in the good part, but in the final analysis, of the detriment----to the industry, the final ending. If it hadn't have been, again for a large group of us, we'd have the revolution in 1937. There is no question that the revolution would have been here. It was all set up and the government knows it. The government, hell, they know it, the FBI knows. The revolution was here. But it wasn't the government that stopped it. It was the people that was working in the shops that was level-headed enough to know what was going on."

           <p>
            Here is part of my story
           </p>
           <p>
            I may be a 20 year old college dropout, but I guarantee I know more about the state of our country than any of those liars reading the teleprompters on the news. 
My Great Grandfather in Flint MI during the 1930s was a Union leader and drove the socialists and commies out of the UAW. I am named Hugh .A. Harris after him. 
I considered not using my real name, but I do not fear the NWO. I want them to know my name to show that no one should be afraid of these clowns. No one serving the globalists has even half the chutzpah of a pede.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today however, we face a different threat. A One Wold Government with socialist ideologies and violent methods to control our country and it is named GLOBALISM. In a interview my great grandfather Hugh gave to the University of Flint Michigan he says "They took the route to destroy from within, and I took the route of learning all to destroy from without". At first glance the quote doesn't seem to make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the quote is taken literally it and is used in the context of the interview it has a very special meaning. Globalism relies on the occult and secrets to hide its agenda. In their arrogance and misconceptions of the public the Globalists agenda flaunts their plans everywhere. The media and Hollywood force feed us the Globalist agenda in the T.V we watch and the Social Media we visit. If one knows how to read through the lines and understands the symbols they use the puzzle can begin to be solved. In other words turning the tide against globalism can be done just by knowing who they are and what they are about.
           </p>
           <p>
            By learning of the occult and what their plans we the people can end their tyranny without bloodshed. reading through the lines and doing my own research on the events unfolding before us in this uncertain times; I have become certain that America is on a fast track to success. For too long politicians that grift and abuse their positions have sold out the public they represent. This week marks a transition to total war against the deep state, foreign influences, and the big money funding it all by the Trump administration. The silent majority has spoken and has joined hands and hearts to lead our country to a bright future. The American people today, like our ancestors before us want to live a peaceful and purposeful life. What we despise and avoid are evil men and women who want nothing less than to control you and your families under the false song of globalism.
The sleeping giant that is The United States of America has awoken to the globalist agenda, and now with faith in one another WE THE PEOPLE can end the sick and twisted sense of humanity the globalists strive for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Andrew Breitbart, an American hero and visionary that was killed in 2012 and died a patriot. During his life Breitbart dedicated himself to fighting the Globalist Scum. Breitbart is quoted saying “Telling the truth is fun", but let me tell you the truth is heartbreaking and dangerous. The Trump movement is possible only because Breitbart.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Steve Bannon says it best "This country is in a crisis. And if you're fighting to save this country, if you're fighting to take this country back, it's not going to be sunshine and patriots. It's going to be people who want to fight. I mean, Andrew Breitbart was all about the fight". We as a people are ready to fight for our country and take it over from the evil tentacles of Globalism. Our creed is set, our leaders are strong, and our goals are righteous. We will fight tooth and nail and because of the will of the people and the American Spirit in the air we will WIN!! 
WE WILL WIN BIGLY.

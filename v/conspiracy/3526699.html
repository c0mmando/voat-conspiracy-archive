                You know, I’m sure it’s spelled out (if not overtly, at least covertly) in the Zohar or the Shulchan Aruch, but I haven’t read those cover to cover. I can only work backward from the results of publicly known policy.

Indeed we see... the same thing happening today. Not just the continued kidnap of Christian children–the disappearance rates of which

                It is nothing, for a jew, to take one of their animals (which they believe are already their slaves), slaughter it, and use its material for their own benefit. It’s the same as a chicken to us. Incidentally, they also

                 Ok.  The Jews and Muslims worship a different God than Christians.  This has to be true.  They will both ritually sacrifice Christians and others.

                 I asked you because I also read it is to open portals for demons or extra dimensional beings.  I am wondering if you went down this rabbit hole.  It is crazy, but nothing surprises me at this point.

                 These people should not even be in America.  This country was founded for people who follow the teachings of Our Creator, and not Satan.

                  Oh, I don’t know about any of that. Certainly sounds insane. Thing about demons is that they’re real. Physically. Modern society may be officially materialistic, but that doesn’t stop humans from having immaterial experiences. Some of the most potent immaterial experiences are negative ones–dread, rage, revulsion, terror. We become conscious, at times, of something sinister in reality, something that is beyond our ability to confront. It exists at the edge of our consciousness and we never perceive it clearly, like a shadow lurking in darkness just beyond what we can see.

                  , they think of something like a red man with horns. They miss what that iconography represented. Children are no longer raised to believe in the devil, but they are raised to believe in Adolf Hitler. Even in a secular society, people cannot escape the reality of evil. They feel it and conceive of it, but they lack a spiritual vocabulary to account for it. So leftists came along are gave them an account. They told them there is this thing called “racism”–the most horrible thing in the world. It leads to death and mayhem and abuse and misery. But a lot of things do that. To make racism special and to make it feel sinister, leftists had to make sure never to define it. There really is no adequate definition for “racism.” Because it lacks definition, it becomes something ambiguous, amorphous. Like a Rorschach blot, you can read into it whatever you want. Leftists have trained people to read into this blot their every intuition of evil. They see in “racism” the devil they know exists, but which their secular education denies. The conception of “racism” in their mind is a vortex of fear, rage, cruelty, inhumanity, and ultimately unintelligibility. Racism to them is primeval darkness that stands opposed to order.

                  Westerners have been conditioned to think of “being racist” in the same way that a medieval peasant would be thought of as “being the devil incarnate.” They dislike being called racist, as it puts an image in their mind of themselves being host to evil–that unclean power upon them. They’re repulsed by the very thought. Westerners don’t even like to read or listen to other people considered “racist,” as they’re afraid that the “sinister power” behind those words will infect them. Somehow they’ll suddenly be invaded and transformed from a good, liberal human into a shade of inhumanity. Something like a shark-toothed, skinheaded, swastika-tattooed, neo-nazi–hollow and soulless inside–whose only desire is to goose-step around shooting off roman salutes and seeking little black and jewish children to kill as he laughs with glee. Because that’s what they’ve been raised to believe. So they are horrified when the accusation is hurled at them and do anything to duck it, including ignore proven statistical facts and immutable biological reality. Racism is supernatural evil to the liberal mind. Calling someone “racist” is like accusing him of being a witch, in days when witches were hanged.

                   Short version:
                  </strong>
                  They’ve hidden their definitionally demonic collective behavioral actions behind the guise of “Devils are red men with pitchforks and cloven hooves and they don’t exist therefore this stuff is all fantasy!” I know all about their numerology. I know that they feel certain numbers have more power than others, and therefore certain combinations are better than others. And also, therefore, that they go so far as to word their plans in very specific, stilted ways to make those numbers better. I know that they have all manner of rituals and rites, by which they abide. There’s a psychological effect to doing so; they may well believe that what they’re doing serves such things. But as for interdimensional portals, etc. I stick to established science and physical possibility.

                   Well, I am at the point now where I think the Jews are either another species or a hybrid.  There could be something to the Serpent Seed Doctrine.  It does not matter if the Serpent is an extraterrestrial or a demon.  Either way, the Jews are fundamentally different than we are.  I think the the Muslims are too.  At the very top, there is little difference between Jews and Muslims, and both groups have an intense hatred of Christians and whites.

                   I have read about Jack Parson of JPL, who was into opening portals.  I have also read about Project Looking Glass and the Hidden Hand interview.  It is curious that Trump created the Space Force.  It could be because the Air Force is infiltrated by the NWO so he does not trust them.  I think you are more skeptical of Trump than I am, but, if Trump is really against us, then we are totally fucked.  I mean, we could still get out of this mess, but it will be a lot more difficult.

                   You are correct in that there is something more there that we do not see in this realm.

             That seems to be the first round of coverup, they tack "gate" onto the end of the scandalous revelation and leave the MSM to do the rest.

           I saw Love &amp; Mercy last night and I noticed the similarities. Brian Wilson and Michael Jackson both had fathers who beat their kids for not being perfect musicians. In Wilson's case his doctor was like a surrogate father, and maybe Jackson was like that, so maybe they just wound up in similar situations.

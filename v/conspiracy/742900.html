            If there is a civil war, the 3,000 of us who post regularly on various conspiracy sites would be first to be cut down.

            Interesting analysis, but I disagree with a few things.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Is it possible Obama wants to incite a civil war?
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Absolutely not. Obama only cares about 1 thing: Obama. He's looking forward to collecting checks, making speeches, and playing golf. A civil war would not help him achieve those goals.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The military has been practicing for an insurgency on American soil
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Yes they have. Because that shit is growing increasingly likely. Especially if there are bank runs, which are entirely possible in a deflationary environment. Markets are headed for a crash, and some elites are going to need bailouts. And they're going to get them. Because Obama will do anything to maintain the illusion that everything is fine.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Obama has been allied with Al-Queda and ISIS. Training them. Giving them arms. Now Obama is bringing his army into the US.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is probably part of a larger plan to ensure that there are more terror attacks on US soil without having to plan them directly, like 9/11. Terrorism is the easiest way to take away peoples rights, pass legislation, consolidate control.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we are looking at an epic financial crisis that may trigger mass protests, society will likely break down in certain distressed urban areas, things are going to get ugly. Anything could happen. I think they have much less control over the situation than they would lead us to believe.

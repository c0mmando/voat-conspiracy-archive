            The difference is that we know, and have proof, of ShareBlue's existence. The same can't be said for supposed Trump shill groups.

            Shariablue means people are getting paid to follow a script. Pretty sure Trump supporters are just feeble-minded group-thinkers.

            Definitely a possibility. I tend to think he has a shit-ton of "organic" diehard fanboys,
           </p>
           <p>
            It's important to consider that pro-Trump people have pretty much been corralled into
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">
             r/the_donald
            </a>
            since that is the only place on social media (other than 4chan) where Trump supporters can gather without being shut down or censored. I think this has actually had the effect of concentrating and galvanizing online Trump supporters and pushing them to extreme fanboyism. Like any other fanboys, they're great at rationalizing away evidence contrary to their chosen narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            In their defense, there was many times during Trump's campaign where it looked like Trump made seemingly horrible mistakes that later were actually shown to be part of a genius strategy. So, I could see why they would still be optimistic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is that it appears that Bannon is being supplanted by Kushner. Bannon was the mastermind behind Trump's platform and campaign strategy. Trump's supporters fell in love with Bannon's ideas, not Trump's. Bannon was very likely the real "4D chessmaster." If it's true that Trump is pushing aside Bannon, that could be very bad for his presidency, especially if Kushner is taking over. Also, it's no secret that weakening Assad is good for Israel.

            I'm a trump supporter that still visits t_d and I feel that the bombing yesterday actually helps trump since Russia doesn't agree with his actions, and comdemned the missle strikes so the liberals crying Russian influence over trump doesn't make sense anymore... democrats look stupid once again.  Also, it was a very contained bombing strike, no unintended casualties, and it definitely doesn't mean there will be a war now. Remember Obama bombed the shit out of Syria as well. So all I see here right now is that trump may have appeased the democrats and made them look stupid at the same time by contradicting the Russian influence circle jerk. No war is imminent just because he made a precise missile strike on a contained target.  I think this is why there has been change of tune on both t_d and here.

            Yeah, and I don't know what the solution is to that. I've been using minds.com lately, and it's great,

            I am mixed on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Launching missiles is not the same as putting boots on the ground.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember when bill clinton launched missiles into al queda training camps, in response to the kenya and tanzania bombings. Then for 3 years nothing more came out of that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am going to wait on this, this might just be a demonstration of power. Trump might be sending a message that he is crazy enough to pull a trigger if he feels like it. This could be the case for the china negotiations coming up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or it could be the start of the third middle eastern front, to speed up the creation of greater israel.

             So you believe that we can just non-chalantly launch missiles into countries that haven't attacked us like it's not a big deal as long as it doesn't lead to "more"? People died, and that's not a big deal to you because "no boots on the ground"?

              Right now some nasty shit is happening: The Russia helped trump narrative has just gone POOF. Suddenly Russia is condemning trump's attack on the Assad regime.

             <p>
              So what happens monday? what happens if this is the extent of the military action? Suddenly the DEMS and the mainstream media are left holding a very deflated bag, while a full blown investigation into the previous administration begins.

              nothing more comes out of this, then trump may even claim that the CIA helped either stage a false flag, or helped with the gassing, and use this as an excuse to go after them.

            No you just don't understand. Trump's supporters are 100% organic and you never see actual anti-trump people irl (someone actually messaged me this last night). He's just playing 35d chess. VOAT-the bastion of free speech (as long as you're pro-trump).

             Genuine Trump supporters are a whole other issue. I'm talking about this: Leading up to the strike both vote and the_donald did nothing but explain/ document the false flag and why we voted for him not to do this. Withing half an hour that changed. The 180 degree turn around on a dime was just too methodical for it not to be obvious that someone/someones had a narrative to push.

              Active members of the Donald understand that Trump is usually playing 8D underwater backgammon. Even moves he makes that initially seem bad often turn out to be good or have a bigger purpose behind them. That's a high energy forum with smart and dedicated people. Initial strong disappointment turned a bit more rational and accepting of the possibility of there being a bigger reason for doing this. Was Trump right in doing that? Time will tell, but he's usually been proven right when things looked their bleakest
             </p>
             <p>
              Does Trump have a social media team or PR agency of some sort? Even as President, I'd be surprised if he doesn't, even a small cereal company or manufacturer tries to monitor social media and do all kinds of social media ads to manage public opinion.
             </p>
             <p>
              Does that mean Trump has a shariablue type of public relations management team that actively spends big bucks shilling for him and creating thousands of accounts to do so? The CIA probably does, but do you really think the deep state is playing on his side?

               They don't care about "his side". They'll use him and his supporters when it's convenient for them. Which is now.

               As for "8D chess", look, honestly? I think all the X-D chess stuff was just a way to explain advanced (but normal) politics to Trump supporters who had tuned out of politics for up to the past 30 years or more. I've been following politics since I was 5 for the past 2 decades and what people call whatever-D chess I honestly just see as politics. He may be really good at it, but it's not something special.

             It has a lot to do wit your candy. Your only 1 month so ofc people think you shill. Why wouldnt they? The real shit is there is a grey area. We shouldn't go to bullshit war over bullshit false flag, but is Trump really in the wrong for making a solid response? There
             <em>
              are
             </em>
             gas bombs in middle east, if there is precedent that we dont do anything when the gas bombs come up, they will become used very often. Trump is , if anything, making a point. He isnt gonna fuck around. He isnt afraid to take action. Thats kinda the way i see it. either way , this shit looks much different than it truly is because media spins it so goddamn hard

             I've been banned for saying things that aren't even anti-Trump, but anti- "the agenda" I'll call it. I had even made the front page several times in the primary and still got banned for pointing out some truths about our wars in the middle east. Made me realize that place isn't the beacon of free speech they claim to be.  And I think the same thing happened here last night. The 180 degree turn around on a dime was just too methodical for it not to be obvious.

              You're right, but I think you should give them credit for admitting they're a echo-chamber, plus I heard it's pretty easy to get unbanned, just gotta ask the mods... unless they don't wanna listen.

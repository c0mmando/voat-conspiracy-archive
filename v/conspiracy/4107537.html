            That was already taken from us via immigration leading to us becoming an ethnic minority in our own country, "integration" preventing us from maintaining any ethnic enclaves, jewish pop culture  attempting to get whites to act like niggers and fags, and "women's rights" preventing marriages from being stable.

            Schools themselves are a problem. They're all mixed, keep children away from their parents for hours per day, they provide a chance for the youth to acquire drugs and have sexual relations, they push propaganda, and they're always looking for something to tell child services to get your kid taken away and you thrown in prison.

            It's fortunate for children and we're likely to see closer family bonds because of it.

            The spirit has been broken for over a century, the culture morphed into something unrecognizable due to being controlled almost entirely by kikes.

            And yet all of that will pale in comparison to the fact that whites are being targeted as a whole.

              I wear a respirator, because flu or not I don't want to get sick and not be able to work, and no one wears a mask that does anything for themselves and very little for others.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't wear one outside, I just stay out of arms reach of everyone like I normally would.
             </p>
             <p>
              You can choose to not go to any stores, or wear an ineffective clown mask when you do if you want.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'll be the one weirdo that women who are normally scared shook of covid point at and laugh because I'm the one guy wearing a mask that will actually give me 99% protection with a airtight seal. And I get to breathe directly on faggots through the vent right in the front.

            The fascist left is using the masks as its armband. Those wearing masks are recognized as part of the left, obedient servants of the left, to be left alone. Those who refuse to wear masks are marked as enemies of the left, and singled out for abuse and assaults.

             because if you'll wear an uncomfortable diaper over your face, constricting your breathing &amp; blocking your mouth, getting you sick...just to not catch invisible kooties, you will turn a blind eye to anything.  These people will watch us tortured to death because they are told it is for the greater good.

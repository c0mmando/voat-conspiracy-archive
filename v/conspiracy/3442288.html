<p>This seems not so different from what Trump has done, mueller report talked about obstruction of justice. Really tho, did so many house and senate politicians care so much about that? Even Goldwater? (((goldewater))) BTW. Nowadays they don\'t, pelosi won\'t start an impoeachment vote cuz most dems will vote against it, embarassing the dem party, because only 37% of americans support impeachment and if dems voted for it then they\'d then get booted out of office. </p>
<p>Nixon had just won in 1972 via a landslide election so he must have been popular. More so than trump right now is. Would all of those politicians got voted out in 1974 an onwards if they did impeach nixon? I bet they would, so why then did they say they would do it, if it is true they did?</p>

<p>On January 3, 1972, Kissinger sent a one-page classified memo to Nixon as a routine update on the Vietnam War. After receiving the memo, Nixon tilted it sideways and wrote in pen to Kissinger:[6]</p>

             It is most unusual to encounter anyone with something good to say about Richard Nixon, he was and still is the only elected US official to have positive input re the JFK assassination .. in 1970 he brought Justice Dept. lawyer John Dean into the White House to "clean up the mess" of the Watergate burglary, which he knew nothing of.

            Nixon wasn't any saint, but he didn't do anything the Democratic Party wasn't also doing, in spades. It's just that his misdeeds and political "tricks" got highlighted by the media, and the wrong-doings of the Democrats were ignored or covered up. Watergate was about looking for dirt on the Democrats that could be used against them in the election. Nixon's people weren't going to fabricate anything, they just wanted to find out what crimes the Democrats were committing. But they went about it in a criminal manner, and got caught, and then Nixon was betrayed by a man he trusted (a man who should burn in hell for eternity for his betrayal of trust).

             agreed. and why would trained CIA operatives bungle the op in such a way, you're telling me they couldn't get in and get out without being caught? Nixon himself might be lying here, but it is a good question don't you think:

            <p>
             than Nixon himself. In his memoirs, Nixon described how he learned about

            <p>
             the burglary while vacationing in Florida, from the morning newspaper. He

             recalled his reaction at the time:

             It sounded preposterous. Cubans in surgical gloves bugging the

            Nixon was a victim of the deep state, even back then, just as JFK was. In fact, it was Nixon's interest in JFK's assassination that put a target on his back. In the White House transcripts, he mentions "the whole Bay of Pigs thing" a few times, which may believe was code for Kennedy's assassination. He was screwed out of the 1960 election by massive vote fraud in Texas and Illinois and was deeply upset with the assassination, thinking it was a coup d'etat, and sought evidence of it.

            There's much more, but you'd have to read Roger Stone's book on the subject. Stone knew Nixon better than anyone, and I think he has the final word on both JFK and Watergate.

            It was a physiological event for the American people , to make the public believe that no one is above the law and that even presidents can be brought down . The common sheep will refer to this event when talking about conspiracies as if nothing can be hidden from the public , this event and the Monica and Bill event in the 90's are the same , make the American public believe that any sort of secret can't be hidden

             Watergate was a lie. It wasn't about exposing the truth, it was about liberals and leftists using the media to destroy a conservative president.

             Chapter 20, "The Seventies: Under Control?", covers political corruption and American disillusion with the government during the 1970s. Zinn argues that the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the exposure of crimes committed by the CIA and FBI during the decade were done by the government in order to regain support from the American people without making fundamental changes to the system. According to Zinn, Gerald Ford's presidency continued the same basic policies of the Nixon administration. Other topics covered include protests against the Honeywell Corporation, Angela Davis, Committee to Re-elect the President, the Watergate scandal, International Telephone and Telegraph's involvement in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, the Mayagüez incident, Project MKUltra, the Church Committee, the Pike Committee, the Trilateral Commission's The Governability of Democracies, and the People's Bi-Centennial.

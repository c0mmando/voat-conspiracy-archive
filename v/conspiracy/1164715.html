            I have to facepalm for every person who actually still believes in the system and thinking Trump is going to change a single thing for the better. ffs it's like people have short term memory.. talk shit about politics all year round up until election season then just falls right back into the snare

            Word on the street is he may pick a democrat running mate, the former head of the NSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            He might be the national security candidate. Someone the intelligence agencies have groomed to take the presidency.
           </p>
           <p>
            If so, then that would explain the desperation that the establishment is showing. The beast that they built, no longer needs them, and is removing them from the equation. I can see a lot of democrats and republicans going to jail in a Trump administration. It also explains why he is very pro surveillance, and why he has former NSA advisers around him.

            Unless youre in a swing state or something like that, I'd just go 3rd party. I've been hoping against the odds that a strong indy turnout will legitimize the movement in upcoming elections.

            I've had the same thoughts as you, but I've come the the conclusion that a chance at being tricked is better than the certainty of the same. Voting trump might be a gamble, voting hillary is going all in, holding pocket 2's, with 4 spades on the river.

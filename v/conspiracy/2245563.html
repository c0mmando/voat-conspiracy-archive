<p>Last night, I was on radio discussing the Las Vegas shooting and the connection to what is happening in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>They are connected.</p>
<p>I’ll start at the beginning.</p>
<p>There was a King Fasal who had a son, Prince Alwaleed, bin Talal.</p>
<p>King Fasal took ill and named his brother Salman as king in his place.</p>
<p>King Salman has named his son an heir to the throne, instead of his brother’s son Prince Al Waleed.</p>
<p>Al Waleed is a Wahabbi. Salman is Suni.</p>
<p>Wahabbi is extreme Islam.</p>
<p>Salman wanted a more modern, non extreme Islam for Saudi. That’s why he named his own son as heir.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, Prince Al Waleed owned the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay resort, including the 32nd floor that was one of the points of shooting at the strip.</p>
<p>I say one of the places, because the witnesses were all correct. There were other locations too.</p>
<p>The Mandalay Bay has a heli-pad on the roof. That is important, because that was the escape route after the carnage.</p>
<p>Paddock was a pilot. He was also a gun runner between the Philippines and the US.</p>
<p>He was running guns for Prince Al Waleed.</p>
<p>He didn’t win at the casino. Those millions came from smuggling.</p>
<p>On the night of the attack, I found out that King Salman was in Las Vegas. (I didn’t know that part until after the show and I received a missing piece of info.</p>
<p>Salman was at the Tropicana.</p>
<p>Paddock was victim one.</p>
<p>Others were used to shoot at the country music venue.</p>
<p>That was to create chaos and distract from the real target over at the Tropicana.</p>
<p>Al Waleed’s assassins shot from Mandalay bay, but they also were at the Tropicana trying to kill Salman.</p>
<p>That explains why there were shooters on the ground as well as in the air.</p>
<p>Remember the videos of the helicopter fly over.</p>
<p>I asked why a helicopter would be there when there was a shooter high up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t news, or cops.</p>
<p>It was the assassins who ran up the stairs to the roof from the 32nd floor.</p>
<p>Remember they sealed the door to the stairwell?</p>
<p>Paddock had access to the service elevator, because the boss said he could use the elevator.</p>
<p>Nobody questioned him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the assassination attempt on Salman failed.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing the result of the failed attempt.</p>
<p>It was not only an assassination attempt and a terror attack, but an attempted coup in Saudi.</p>
<p>This is why everyone shut up in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The response is still ongoing.</p>
<p>You are watching it play out.</p>
<p>As I said, I spoke on air about this.</p>
<p>I will post links in comments to prove my story.</p>
<p>Las Vegas was definitely a terror attack.</p>
<p>Al Waleed, the owner of the suite was who is behind all of it.</p>
<p>All the witnesses citing multiple shooters all told the truth.</p>
<p>There were shootouts along the strip and in Mandalay Bay &amp; Tropicana hotels.</p>
<p>The reason nobody is talking is it’s not over yet. No automatic alt text available.</p>

           <p>
            So where is the evidence of the helo taking off from the Mandalay bay roof? The only helo on scene was the police chopper, several videos document this very well using radar and corroborating the time and track with video.

             Pfff idk... Not even sure half of this is accurate, a commenter pointed at a couple of flaws in the narrative already
            </p>
            <p>
             Yemen is a mini vietnam in SA's backyard, with iran as backer
            </p>
            <p>
             From there two POV:
            </p>
            <p>
             SA's dependency toward US defense is increased, side effect
            </p>
            <p>
             US gets dragged further into a confrontation with Iran
            </p>
            <p>
             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             If I wanted to end iran conflict with SA, being SA, I would get closer to russia, and make deals in that perspective
            </p>
            <p>
             Am I "allowed" to do it ? Is this really what I want ?
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe the answer to both is no

            I like the idea but there's some fundamental flaws in this story. I am not saying its all wrong but this given fact patterns is fictitious. Could this be linked to KSA probably, were there multiple shooters quite likely and Paddock is 100% a patsy.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In Las Vegas, Prince Al Waleed owned the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay resort, including the 32nd floor that was one of the points of shooting at the strip.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Al Waleed only owns the top 8 floors of the 42 story building, floor 35 and up.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Mandalay Bay has a heli-pad on the roof. That is important, because that was the escape route after the carnage.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Flight radar data was and is publicly available from that night, this can be faked but video footage also shows the helicopter while suspicious does not approach the Mandalay bay.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On the night of the attack, I found out that King Salman was in Las Vegas. (I didn’t know that part until after the show and I received a missing piece of info. / Salman was at the Tropicana.
            </p>

            Unsourced not vetted imo no basis for these statements. The data given on the link this guy in white

            King of KSA. Issues here are this person breaks off from the armed security and does not leave the building with them, also he does not look remotely like King Salman. If you watch the clip one of the armed guards says break off and white shirt and suit break off. He is undercover hotel security by the looks of it.
           </p>

            You need to focus on the guy in the middle of the pack with the backpack, stretcher &amp; Mohawk if anyone.

             Yeah I've not gotten too far into the mythology surrounding this particular scandal but I agree Paddock is a patsy.  It's difficult to produce any reasonable read on the situation that doesn't have Paddock as a patsy.

            Damn, I just wish we lived in a world where those slaughtered could see justice.  I long for the days when you knew your enemy.  He didn't hide in the shadows slaughtering innocents.

            If you believe MegaAnon and Q-Anon from 4chan, not only was it an assassination plot on Salman, but it was also an assassination plot against Trump, who was supposedly there having a secret meeting with Salman.

             That's the first I've heard of trump possibly being there. Sounds like he's being shoehorned into the situation

              This is one of the archives of one particular Q-Anon post leaving breadcrumbs about the assassination plot, though there are others scattered through his other posts from separate days:
              <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/cS8cMPVQ/order/asc/">
               https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/cS8cMPVQ/order/asc/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              This is one of the archives from MegaAnon about the assassination plot on Trump:
              <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/T%2BvJ%2Bvhp/order/asc">
               https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/search/uid/T%2BvJ%2Bvhp/order/asc
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Notice not only everything she said about Vegas, but she also says, "they tried to JFK Trump, and he knows it."
             </p>
             <p>
              There might be more throughout her posts as well, but you'll have to dig for them. Those are just the ones I remembered specifically. If you would like to dig and need links to hers and Q's compilation of posts, I'll leave a link for you to those too.

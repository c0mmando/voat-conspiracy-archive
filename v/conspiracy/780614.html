            As all large landmass continent spanning countries have an ever increasing migration to major cities, the ability to monitor and apply further controls on physical freedoms is ever evolving.
           </p>
           <p>
            I foresee neighborhoods monitored via botnet style mass mini-drones that can easily be controlled and monitored from whatever location they deem to house the staff required to operate. Its obvious these can be mass produced with existing technology levels of programming in the open market, why wouldn't the government already be testing and researching the deployment of such a system.
           </p>
           <p>
            How easy is it going to be for the government to get the population to willingly ask and thank them for such a system when it is offered in times like these, a population controlled by fear and ignorance.

            youd prolly be quite correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            this is how theyd build a concentration camp, for instance:

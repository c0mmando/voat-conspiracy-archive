            World War One was basically a masonic conspiracy by British intelligence. One part of the World War I conspiracy was oil:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As executed by the Round Table organizations, the brunt of the Illuminati’s plan for the twentieth century depended significantly on the assistance of the Salafi intriguers, beginning with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire. More important still was the role-played by the puppet-state of Saudi Arabia, which became the sponsor of Salafi terrorism. The Saudis would become an important linchpin in the Illuminati strategy to make the world dependent on Rockefeller-controlled oil, thus not only increasing demand and profits, but enhancing their strangle-hold over the world’s governments and economies.
            </p>
            <p>
             The primary agent in this agenda was Winston Churchill. Winston Churchill was a descendant of the first famous member of the Churchill family, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. Churchill’s legal surname was Spencer-Churchill, as he was related to the Spencer family, though, starting with his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, his branch of the family used the name Churchill in his public life. Randolph Churchill’s mother, like his grandfather’s wife, and his great-grandfather’s wife, was a Stewart, also descended from James Douglas. Winston Churchill’s mother was Jennie Jerome, daughter of American Jewish millionaire Leonard Jerome.[1]
            </p>
            <p>
             Winston Churchill, a Scottish Rite Freemason, was eventually invested as Knight of the Order of the Garter. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids, created by Wentworth Little, founder of the SRIA.[2] The famous “V for Victory” sign used by Churchill has been attributed to Aleister Crowley. At the request of his friend, naval intelligence officer Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond 007, Crowley provided Winston Churchill with valuable insights into the superstitions of the Nazis. Crowley suggested that Churchill exploit the Nazis’ magical paranoia by being photographed as much as possible giving the two-fingered “V for Victory” gesture, a powerful symbol of destruction and annihilation that, according to magical tradition, is capable of defeating the perverted solar energies represented by the Nazi swastika.[3]

           <p>
            Of course, the Rothschilds were involved:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             As indicated in “The Rothchilds, Winston Churchill and the Final Solution”, by Clifford Shack, No naval issue would affect Britain’s foreign policy more than the crucial debate whether or not the Royal Navy should be converted from coal propulsion to oil.[4] Oil was not only superior to coal, but the French branch of the Rothschilds were, together with the Rockefellers, supreme rulers of the oil business, having entered into a world cartel with Standard Oil...
            </p>
            <p>
             The importance of guaranteeing a supply of oil for Britain’s navy had assumed centre stage, as oil had not yet been discovered in its Arab possessions in the Gulf. On June 17, 1914, Churchill introduced a bill proposing that the British government invest in an oil company, after which it acquired 51 percent of Anglo-Persian, which in actuality was already partially-owned by the British government, and was financed in part by the Rothschilds bank. Britain had acquired its first oil concession, and kept its involvement secret. By the summer of 1914, the British Navy was fully committed to oil and the British government had assumed the role of majority stockholder in Anglo-Persian. The company grew rapidly, first into Anglo-Iranian, and then finally into British Petroleum, or BP.
The same conspirators created the Federal Reserve a few years before. World War One was key to getting the US into debt with the bankers, and setting up the Russian Revolution:
            </p>
            <p>
             The further purpose of WWI was to create the preconditions for the Russian revolution of 1918, which was financed and orchestrated by Jacob Schiff, through Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Company of New York, to overthrow the aristocracy. The result was to exact the Rothschilds’ revenge against Russian Czar Alexander I, for having thwarted their first attempt at world government at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. According to Albert Pike, the further aim was to transform Russia into a bastion of their atheistic communist creed, “to be built up and used to destroy other governments and weaken religion."
            </p>
            <p>
             When WWI was eventually mired in a stalemate at the fronts of Europe, the Illuminati used their agent President Woodrow Wilson to gain America’s entry into the war. Wilson’s friend and “alter ego” was Rothschild agent Col. Edward Mandell House. Col. House was a member of the Round Table, whose projects for the US included a graduated income tax, a central bank, creation of a Central Intelligence Agency, and the League of Nations. According to the Col. E.M. House Report, a ten-page “progress report”, addressed to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Col. House details progress in preparing “for the peaceful return of the American colonies to the dominion of the Crown.” “Crown” refers, not to the Queen, but to the owners of the Bank of England. Col. House writes: “We have wrapped this plan in the peace treaty so that the world must accept from us the League or a continuance of the war. The League is in substance the Empire with America admitted on the same basis as our other colonies.”
            </p>

            Finally, there was the destruction of the Ottoman Empire to allow Britain to occupy their territories so that the Zionists could have their homeland:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A further purpose of the WWI was to cause the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, in order to free the land of Palestine from its grasp, leading to the creation of the Zionist state of Israel. After Prime Minister of England, Lord Asquith, was deposed in 1916, because he had opposed Zionist interests. David Lloyd George, whose career was made as a lawyer for the World Zionist Organization, as well as Winston Churchill and Arthur Balfour of the Round Table, were placed in power. Present at the first official meeting of the Political Committee were Lord Rothschild, James de Rothschild, the son of Edmund de Rothschild of Paris, former owner of Rothschild colonies in Palestine, and Sir Mark Sykes. There, the future mandates of Palestine, Armenia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia, then still forming parts of the Ottoman Empire, were discussed in detail.

             The Captains and the Kings is a great novel (heavily referenced with a page and a half of documents/essays/books/accounts/etc) from before WWI listed at the back.  The novel is based on facts around Rory Daniel Armagh who was the 1912 Democratic Front runner.

           This question arrises from the fact that of all the children that were conceived in this way that i know personally,  didn't retain any of the fathers family traits even though the donor is supposedly chosen to be an as close as possible physical match of the father, 
which is of course unverifiable since it's done under strict anonimity and confidentionallity. Also all of the children aforementioned, seem to suffer from at least one devellopmental condition (mainly variations of autism but also increased risk of allergies).

           This could all be pure coincidence from my limited observation, but it still poses an intresting prospect as such treatments become more and more commonplace due to surrogacy, planned single motherhood and the decrease in fertility in woman with age coinciding with the recent trend of only getting pregnant at more advanced ages.

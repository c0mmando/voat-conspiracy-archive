            Ahhhhh.....the russian troll army! Last time they were a popular bogeyman was after the engineered coup in Ukraine....I used to hang around the Guardian comments section at the time, interestingly, many times when I questioned the narrative we were fed about that I'd be accused of being on Putin's payroll....I'm not saying there weren't russian trolls there....but there were a hell of a lot more kneejerk reactions to obvious questions, and though some I'm sure had just bought the anti Putin propoganda, many more were likely paid to keep those of us looking at the situation objectively quiet
           </p>
           <p>
            That was a big red pill for me on the nature of media and what we hold to be true....for most people it's just what they've been told

            Kind of like how the dnc paid groups of people to disrupt and cause violence. Not to mention bussing people around from vote booth to vote booth. Calling for illegals to vote and outright blatant voter fraud.  Sure go ahead put as much emphasis on the wrong sylabal all you want.  That will never stop the fact that bills sife lost because the american people are fucking sick and tired of the established regime that was in power.  We are sick of being fucking lied to, bills wife a massive piece of shit has nothing to do with that bitch losing.  And of course the death of Seth Rich has nothing to do with her losing as well.

Michelle Obama is transgender and was born a man, and Obama is a gay Muslim. His family pictures were also faked, which has basically been proven. Let\'s also not forget that Joan Rivers was dead weeks after claiming that Michelle Obama was actually a man.</p>
<p>Now if you\'ve been wondering why the Obama administration is all about capitulating to Muslims and transgender people now you know why. Now before you dismiss what I\'m saying, take a look at some of the evidence/proof.</p>
<p>Well for one Obama\'s family pictures are fakes. I won\'t go into the details because all the information in right here, and is self evident.</p>
<p>https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/05/12/family-pictures-of-young-obama-are-fake/comment-page-1/</p>
<p>Now on to Michelle Obama being a man. Here is a video of Barack Obama calling her Micheal.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/8cgk732vfGQYouTubeYouTube</p>
<p>Now that video alone may not be enough to justify calling her a man, so here are some pictures of her genitalia.</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/pjNxKSx</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/66OiCWC</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/Dea6oR5</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/uyk5m1I</p>
<p>Here\'s a picture that should be able to convince even the harshest of sceptics.</p>
<p>http://m.imgur.com/oVHMdDZ</p>
<p>Now here\'s a picture of him scratching his balls while wearing a Muslim headscarf.</p>
<p>http://m.imgur.com/iEYBU1k</p>
<p>Now if what you\'ve seen so far isn\'t sufficient evidence to convince you just wait, there\'s more. Michelle Obama has the anatomy of a man. Now there are exceptions, so this information in itself does not constitute sufficient proof to claim she\'s a man, but keep in mind that only a very small percentage of women have anatomy like this, and when you take into account all the other evidence it\'s quite clear that the odds of her being a women are slim to none.</p>
<p>Now first of all, look the broadness of her shoulders.</p>
<p>http://m.imgur.com/K3b4k0d</p>
<p>Now look at her hands.</p>
<p>http://m.imgur.com/JLYVNUW</p>
<p>In the vast majority of cases a woman\'s index finger is the same length as her ring finger as depicted here.</p>
<p>http://m.imgur.com/aDFOxzU</p>
<p>As you can see, Michelle Obama\'s either a man, or once again she\'s one of the rare few.</p>
<p>Now there are many more examples of her having male anatomy but these are the most obvious and easiest to show you.</p>
<p>So it\'s safe to assume that Michelle Obama is indeed a man, which means Obama is a homosexual. Which could explain why he posed on the cover of a gay magazine.</p>
<p>http://mobile.wnd.com/2015/11/obama-poses-for-gay-magazine-cover/</p>
<p>Now once again, there is much more information that supports this theory, but this information should be enough to lead people in the right direction in case they want to do their own research.</p>
<p>Now, Obama is also a Muslim. All one has to do is judge him on his actions. But without documenting all of his political moves favouring Muslims, I\'ll just show you what I believe to be the smoking gun evidence. Barack Obama wears a Muslim ring that is engraved with " The only God is Allah".</p>
<p>http://mobile.wnd.com/2012/10/obamas-ring-there-is-no-god-but-allah/</p>
<p>Barack Obama is gay Muslim and his wife in transgender. That is why the Obama administration is favouring Muslims and focusing so much on imposing a transgender agenda on America. He\'s more than likely not even an American citizen considering how his family photos were faked as was his birth certificate.</p>
<p>The thing is, he\'s simply a scapegoat. The Zionists that put him into power are using him as a fall guy. Eventually it will be revealed that he was indeed a gay Muslim, and they\'ll blame him for assisting the Muslims wage a global jihad against the West as well as for trying to impose the gay transgender agenda on America. He\'s also anti-American and anti- Western and they\'ll blame him for all the harm that was committed to America and the West.</p>
<p>We truly live in incredible times and it really just goes to show people how we are basically living in a false reality. Our culture is artificial. The information we get from from the media is propaganda. We are pretty much living in the Matrix.</p>
<p>Now there is a lot of information I left out because I didn\'t want to this document to overwhelm the reader with an overload of information. This is simply a compilation of what\'s easy to understand. I implore you to do some of your own research into everything, because like I said, what this isn\'t even close to being all the evidence.</p>',

            I hate to say it, but I'm willing to stay in the dark on this one as long as I don't have to see anything resembling the first lady's ballsack.

            Michelle is strangely masculine, and barrak did (reportedly) have a reputation for preferring the company of men in college, but when it comes down to it I don't particularly care what these two are. Barrak doesnt have to be a muslum to pander to muslims, he just does.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for you fall-guy theory, well thats a thought. Wouldn't shock me at all. It's the only reason all this talk is happening the last few months of his presidency.

            All you need to do is read the DNC charter on Neutrality. They are bound by their own laws to show zero favoritism, much less enter into contractual agreements with only one candidate. DUH.

            Since Bernie was not granted identical representation inside the DNC, it's illegal. You are simply wrong. You're basically stupid.

            </a>
            I think most people need a better layout of the issue. Most people don't really know exactly what the DNC is, much less how this represents political misuse of powers designed to be independent.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, Stone joined Mook atop the HRC team in 2015, so it should be understood that these are partisan (relative to the DNC) political operatives engaging with the DNC. They're acting as if the primary is already over, but regardless of their
            <em>
             attitudes
            </em>
            , they're working to inseminate that attitude in the DNC
            <em>
             at the very least
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, there is context regarding the "poor communication" and "difficult relationship" within DNC leadership. The DNC leadership included the likes of Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Donna Brazile who have proved to be anything but independent. On the other side of those struggles are Amy Dacey and Tusli Gabbard, the latter of whom has been particularly vocal about uncovering shenanigans between the Democratic leadership powers and the current wars in the Middle East---the motivations of which are shrouded in lies that are unfortunately being soaked up by a large portion of the Democratic voting base without proper research and critical evaluation. Unfortunately, I'd need many paragraphs to fully relate all the related issues, but anyone following the gist of this conversation is encouraged to backtrack and read or reread what they might not have grocked the first time around (I admit I did not understand the situation well in 2015 because my own personal priorities had me reading less about politics).
           </p>
           <p>
            Between the lines, I think what this memo represents is evidence that the Clinton team was running through the ranks pressure for partisan alignment in order to secure Hillary's annointment as The Candidate. What were these "negotiations"? Favors? Blackmail (this happens more than most people understand)? How clear is it at this point that Sanders supporters were giving up late in the game as it became more and more clear that the Superdelegates were stacked against them? How clear can it be that Clinton was forceful in her suggestion that the primary was over long before it should have been giving relatively tight voting totals as she kept pointing toward those superdelegates? This should be clear to anyone who has done a fair amount of reading and research at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Coming back to the memo...it may be a mistake to say that this memo [alone] is proof of the Clinton team rigging (or coercing or however one might want to explain it) the primary including the inappropriate use of DNC resources [or at least appropriating some of those resources to the upcoming general election long before that was appropriate, further isolating the Sanders movement]. This memo serves as an addition piece of the whole puzzle where the the puzzle solvers didn't have enough pieces yet. The picture got clearer. And it will continue to get clearer---but only for those ignoring the intentionally obfuscating time-dominating mainstream media that barely employees anyone with enough brain cells to put together much more than what the gatekeepers feed them.

             Let's throw some fuel on the fire. Leaked emails show discussions of DNC executives discussing strategies to make Sanders look bad in run-ups to primaries including the use of his Jewish racial heritage and his possibly atheist religious outlook.

             This is certainly far from the neutral usage of resources.
            </p>
            <p>
             Honestly, I've read so much about the corruption of the DNC that I don't even remember everything I've read---I have to keep reminding myself who some of the players are and what they've done because my life doesn't center around a political roladex. But every shred of evidence certainly makes it appear as if the DNC was used as a cudgel against anyone opposing the Clinton machine. And, of course, this appears consistent to me and anyone else who believes the Clinton is corrupt and toxic. How many cases in point are necessary?
            </p>
            <p>
             As a liberal, I desperately hope this incarnation of the Democratic Party gets plowed under and replaced with something more honest. But this will only happen if we the people find all the ways we can to pressure for the results we want.

            It's illegal. They can't DO THAT with the DNC. Anything they do, the Sanders campaign should have had. They can't have special deals and special projects. It's a competition. Do you not realize their charter to remain impartial or the lawsuit now?

            Isn't this just a bunch of memos discussing what they'll do "when" they get the nomination because they're so sure they will?  I'd absolutely love proof that HRC arranged to have the primary rigged, but if this is it, I certainly don't understand how...

             What part of that is confusing you about them coming to an "understanding" through a "series of negotiations" and having one of them sign a contract with the DNC for them to have an insider?

              That's proof of shady shit, but the headline says "Proof Hillary Clinton Rigged the Primary", and to me, that implies stolen votes--not just having access to better resources and whatnot.  Maybe that's just not the right definition.

               Their charter was to remain impartial. That is riggiing. It's tipping the scale. Aka, rigging.

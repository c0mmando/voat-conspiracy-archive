<p>I\'ve seen a lot of people comparing the TPP to Nazi Germany, with good reason - some of the policies are certainly reminiscent of Nazi domestics.</p>
<p>But here\'s the difference.</p>
<p>The people of Nazi Germany <em>wanted</em> fascism. Hitler was elected <strong>twice</strong>. The Germany people knew that they were surrendering their democracy for an autocracy when they put the Nazis in power. That\'s <em>why</em> they did it.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in the Soviet Union. The revolution was started by a small group of people with the sole intent to give themselves complete control of the country. They flew a nice banner and picked up a few genuinely good-hearted people along the way, but in the end the only thing Stalin was ever fighting for was himself.</p>
<p>That isn\'t happening here. That isn\'t happening now.</p>
<p>The American public has had a hood pulled over their eyes for the past twenty years. We\'ve been slipping, no doubt. We\'ve been gobbling up the lies and the fodder like it was candy, because oftentimes it actually WAS candy. </p>
<p>Hitler came to power with promises of stability, unity, and a Germany restored to pre-1915 ways. He promised the German people an empire, and he gave them one.</p>
<p>The TPP isn\'t doing that.</p>
<p>The TPP isn\'t what the people want.</p>
<p>Nobody <em>wants</em> the TPP to pass, except for the powers that serve to benefit from it. The general public doesn\'t know about it, because the people writing it made sure that they didn\'t.</p>
<p>Why? Why would they be so secretive? The DMCA wasn\'t secretive. The PATRIOT Act wasn\'t secretive. Neither was the FREEDOM Act, or the dozens of other acts and statutes designed to fuck over the public.</p>
<p>Here\'s the difference.</p>
<p>The PATRIOT Act was <em>called for</em> by the public. They wanted it. They didn\'t know that they didn\'t want it, to be more precise. The FREEDOM Act was SSDD. The DMCA has been fought against, tooth and nail, by organizations such as the EFF or ACLU.</p>
<p>The public doesn\'t want the TPP. The public won\'t ever want the TPP. No amount of propaganda can change that, and the people voting on it know that.</p>
<p><em>That\'s</em> why it\'s so secret - it isn\'t to keep it from your eyes or mine, it\'s to keep it from the 85%. The people who usually can\'t be bothered.</p>
<p>Because they already know what I\'m about to tell you.</p>
<p>Hitler rose on popular support because the people were flawed. The German public in 1933 saw Germany as a powerful empire that had been destroyed by democracy. They saw the Republic as a failure not as a republic, but as republicanism as a whole. They wanted a king, so they elected one.</p>
<p>The American public are the exact opposite. They\'ve been fed the lie of &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; all of their lives. Sure it was a lie, but here\'s the thing - even though it\'s a lie, they still believe it. We have a gun culture in the US, much to the apprehension of many. We have a culture where the concept of freedom is so ingrained in our minds, it\'s literally become a meme.</p>
<p>Because of that, the TPP will never have public support. America will never willingly become a kingdom. We will never accept autocracy. It\'s in our blood not to.</p>
<p>I\'ve heard the arguments against this. &quot;The people are too comfortable,&quot; you say, &quot;they\'ll never want to stop drinking their sodas long enough to fight a revolution.&quot;</p>
<p>Here\'s the problem with that.</p>
<p>The TPP isn\'t the DMCA. It isn\'t the PATRIOT Act. There will be no equivalent to the &quot;if you don\'t like this, you\'re a terrorist&quot; of 2001 or the &quot;if you don\'t like this, you\'re a pirate&quot; of the early 2000s. The TPP\'s cover story is \'free trade\' - something irrelevant to you and me, right?</p>
<p>And here\'s the other thing. Unlike the DMCA or PATRIOT Act or NSA spying which were freedom-destroying but mostly unobtrusive to Generic Joe, the TPP will be a major burden on society. When suddenly everyone\'s getting cancer because Nestle threw lead in their bottled water and then sued the government for trying to stop them, or when people start getting arrested for ripping an audio CD they bought, or when people are given the death penalty for an overdue library book (technically copyright theft!), <em>people will care</em>.</p>
<p>There will be no smoke thick enough, no mirror strong enough, to stop the public from seeing through the cloak and dagger. We\'ve been told to bend over, we\'ve been told to beg them - but now they\'re asking us to die for them, and the public will not stand for this.</p>
<p>We\'re already at a boiling point. You know what happens when you boil water inside a corked flask, and then just keep heating it up?</p>
<p>Eventually, the flask will explode.</p>',

            wanted

           fascism. Hitler was elected

           The PATRIOT Act was

           by the public. They wanted it. They didn't know that they didn't want it, to be more precise. The FREEDOM Act was SSDD. The DMCA has been fought against, tooth and nail, by organizations such as the EFF or ACLU.

            Very well said. I like to remain hopeful though. What the globalists are trying to do is insane beyond imagination and goes against the natural order of things. They will inevitably fail, but at what cost?

              The next renaissance, if we can survive what's coming, should be glorious. Just imagine, free, sustainable energy, abundant organic food for all, free internet and telecommunications, free college/university education, free healthcare, basic income, legalized weed, and free housing for all. Also, the freedom of leisure time with automation taking over many jobs such that people no longer need to work for a company, and just work on building themselves.

            I hate to break it to you but there are crazy lunatic socialists and communists in America trying to destroy America and take over if they haven't already done so.   Almost the entirety of the Democratic party is so far left they are mix of socialists and communists.

            Here's a facebook page of some of them:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And they are spreading:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Red Guards – Los Angeles is a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist cadre formation based in Los Angeles, specifically in Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles. Since our formation on October 4, 2014, we’ve been affiliated with the New Communist Party (Liaison Committee) (NCP-LC) as part of the organization’s mission to forge a new Maoist communist party in the U.S. Although we’re a relatively new Maoist formation, we’ve already gained some modest traction."

            I honestly think the biggest difference is the Internet and the Information Age.  The stunts that both the Republicans and the Democrats (and don't fool yourself, it's BOTH of them) are trying to pull would have been gone unnoticed had it been 1930.  Today though, enough Americans see that we are being sold down the river.  I just hope we're ready for what's coming.

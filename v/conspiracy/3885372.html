</p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the things he\'s worked on from wikipedia.</p>
<p>In April 2018, Berman\'s office issued a search warrant of the office and hotel room of Michael Cohen, Trump\'s former lawyer, for possible bank fraud and campaign finance violations.[31][32][33] Since Berman is recused by the U.S. Attorney General\'s Office from the investigation, he was apparently not involved in the decision to raid Cohen\'s office.[34] That search was presumably conducted under the authority of Robert Khuzami, Berman\'s top deputy.</p>
<p>On August 8, 2018, U.S. Representative Chris Collins, his son Cameron, and the father of Cameron\'s fiancée, Stephen Zarsky, were arrested by the FBI and charged with insider trading and making false statements by Berman.</p>
<p>On October 26, 2018, Berman charged Cesar Sayoc with sending a string of homemade incendiary packages to several present and former federal officials, including former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>In October 2018, Berman charged five doctors and one pharmacist with narcotics distribution, including prescribing opioids to individuals who had no medical need for them.</p>
<p>In November 2018, Berman charged recording artist and performer Daniel Hernandez, better known as 6ix9ine, with six felony counts of racketeering and violence to aid racketeering. </p>
<p>On November 26, 2018, Berman announced the indictment of former Honduran Congressman Tony Hernández on drug trafficking and weapons charges. </p>
<p>On January 8, 2019, Berman charged Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, with obstruction of justice in connection with a false and misleading declaration she submitted to a judge in the Southern District of New York. </p>
<p>On March 25, 2019, Berman charged Michael Avenatti with extortion in connection with his threat to Nike that he would go public with damaging allegations against Nike employees unless Nike paid him over $20 million. </p>
<p>In April 2019, Berman brought the first ever drug trafficking charges against a pharmaceutical company and two of its executives, charging Rochester Drug Co-Operative and its former CEO, Laurence Doud III, with conspiring to distribute oxycodone and fentanyl and to defraud the DEA. </p>
<p>In May 2019, Berman charged Avenatti with another indictment, alleging that he stole $300,000 from his client Stormy Daniels. </p>
<p>In July 2019, Berman charged financier Jeffrey Epstein with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. </p>
<p>On October 9, 2019, Berman announced charges against Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and two others for campaign violations relating to the illegal use of straw donors and foreign money.</p>
<p>On October 15, 2019, Berman announced the indictment of Halkbank, the largest state-owned bank in Turkey, for a multi-billion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. </p>
<p>On November 19, 2019, Berman charged guards Michael Thomas and Tova Noel with creating false records, and with conspiracy, after video footage obtained by prosecutors revealed that Jeffrey Epstein had, against regulation, been in his cell unchecked for eight hours before being found dead on August 10, 2019.</p>
<p>On January 27, 2020, at a press conference sponsored by Safe Horizon at the site of Jeffrey Epstein\'s New York mansion, Berman was asked whether Prince Andrew was cooperating with the SDNY\'s investigation into Epstein\'s coconspirators. </p>
<p>On February 11, 2020, Berman announced charges against Lawrence Ray, who sex trafficked and extorted his daughter\'s college roommates. </p>
<p>On February 25, 2020, it was reported and confirmed by an SDNY spokesperson that a search warrant was executed at the Manhattan offices of Peter Nygård amid a sex-trafficking investigation.</p>
<p>On March 9, 2020, Berman announced the indictment of 27 people, including Jason Servis and Jorge Navarro, involved in doping racehorses across the country. </p>
<p>On March 26, 2020, Berman announced the indictment of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and other Venezuelan officials on charges of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import hundreds of tons of cocaine into the United States and related weapons offenses. </p>
<p>On April 30, 2020, Berman announced drug trafficking and weapons charges against Juan Carlos &quot;The Tiger&quot; Bonillo, the former head of the Honduras National Police. </p>
<p>On April 30, 2020, Berman announced a deferred prosecution agreement against Bank Hapoalim, Israel\'s largest bank, for conspiring to hide assets and income in offshore accounts.</p>',

            Smells quite simply like bad actors doing something while pretending Trump ordered it, and they did the equivalent of a political shart - once it had enough attention, someone has to blink first.

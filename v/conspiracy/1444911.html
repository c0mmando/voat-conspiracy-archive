            I have a credible source who called me on his was home from work at Google today who told me the place is freaking out in its attempt to do damage control. (self.conspiracy)

I cannot prove this. He just called me. It is quite interesting. He told me to check the Google Trends, and yes, there certainly is a "hockey-stick" trend. I honestly think this is "The Great Global Wake Up" - that is what it should actually be called, as it is much larger than Pizzagate.
We live in interesting times, my friends.
Any thoughts?
EDIT: My apologies, I am new. Long time browser, second time poster I think. I appreciate the responses. Yes, I meant to search "Pizzagate" in Google Trends.
Honestly, I did not think anyone would respond because I do not have any proof, aside from what I was told and to check out Google Trends as direct evidence wen using Pizzagate and related search terms.
Check out when you type in Podesta - yet another spike.
Keep taking screenshots of key phrases in Google Trends and track them. They could lead to interesting information, potentially, but certainly reinforce the growth of the movement.
Please capture these if possible. I do not have time right now.
I felt I could contribute to the cause, I did my best to help Please, continue to spread the word to your friends and family.

            Please Help: Capture the Google Trends of all known Pizzagate keywords - It helps to convince others that they are a part of a large growing movement.

            I just thought of this - it makes sense to me, hopefully to you as well: this little pizza joint probably did not receive that much web traffic, UNTIL they planned a sex party. If we follow the Google Trends of "Comet Ping Pong" and other key phrases, we ay be able to put together a schedule of when they planned their sex parties, maybe tie it to missing persons cases, etc. Does anyone out there understand what I am trying to describe? The Google Trends data will lead us directly to spikes when web traffic was heavy, hence a higher likelihood that these alleged pedophiles logged into the site at that time, assuming they used Google to get there. We might even be able to put together a calendar of what went on when it went on through using Google Trends. The potential exists, at least, and we need your help to uncover if this is true. Does this make sense to anyone else out there?

The problem is that most people just want to live a happy life, but a small group of people want everything for themselves. They think that if they can take everything for themselves and nobody will stop them, then it is alright to do it.
They never stop to think "Should I take everything for myself? What about other people?"

Don't trust or use Google. Don't trust or use Facebook. Don't trust or read/watch mainstream media.

Even if you don't use Google intentionally, you're using Google. Download NoScript and you'll see what I'm talking about. googletagservices, googleapis, google-analytics, and more.

It's an interesting trend page.

            Makes me wonder what happens when, say, the average Russian knows about this? Or is this a huge problem there as well?
Couple other things..
Guess it should be obvious that most people are checking this in the evenings.
Also "pizzagate banned" is the #3 Related Search, so... BACKFIRE!!

Here is my first post that got me to thinking about this. My friend at Google triggered me to go to Google Trends.
Here is that post:
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ffavn/i_have_a_credible_source_who_called_me_on_his_was/">

            I hope this helps someone or our efforts. If it does, I would appreciate any positive feedback.

I sure hope this goes somewhere... I think this is a good idea. I keep getting downvoted thought. They are attacking back as hard as they can.

A programmer who can whip out a few scripts and start them as cron jobs and dump data to time-stamped files would be gold.
Are you out there?

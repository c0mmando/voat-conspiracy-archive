            This is along the lines of the cultural appropriation crowd to me. If you start with rabbit hole because a pedofag used it; eventually you will run out of words to adequately describe the image you’re trying to convey.

            I understand the Roman church and their adopted pagan rituals that became the Christian holidays too, but I think there are more immediate problems in the world. Calling an arbitrary day in the Gregorion calendar “Easter” doesn’t seem that great a threat comparatively.

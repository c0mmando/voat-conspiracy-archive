            I know exactly how you feel. On the rare occasion I watch the "news", I gaze in unbelief that people actually believe this scripted propaganda. I used to be an avid fox news junkie, but after last election season, I had to drop them completely. It's like you can write the story before it's reported. I don't even believe our history anymore. I don't feel hopeless, just aware now.

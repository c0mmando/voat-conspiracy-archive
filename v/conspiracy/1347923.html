            You have an opinion that's clearly not going to change from scientific arguments, because it's based in a personal experience with extraterrestrials.

            Quantum Metaphysics debunks the double-slit experiment, as it can only use monochromatic light for the famous effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the book, Quantum Metaphysics:
            <em>
             "Using a light with more than one color the experiment will break down, because the effect depends entirely on the wavelength of the photon. Photons of different color wavelengths will have different patterns through the slit. A red photon will be larger than a blue photon, and so will its magnetic field. Photons passing over an object will bend from the interaction of the magnetic fields. A small enough slit will produce the patterns seen in the experiment but a large slit will not, as the photon's magnetic field will not interfere with the slit. When the photon passes through a slit with two sides some photons will bend in one direction and some will bend in an other direction. This effect is light diffraction, but because two slits are being used the diffraction will form an interference pattern."
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Your observation of reality changes reality" because you are observing your perspective.

            Declaring that quantum uncertainty means 'reality is subjective' is exactly what the Wikipedia page meant by 'endless speculations.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Relativity and quantum effects may be strange and counterintuitive to macro-based reality, but that doesn't mean reality is subjective by any stretch of the imagination.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example - by constructing specific situations and moving at significant percentages of lightspeed, it's possible for two observers to record a very different reality than others. They might disagree about the times of certain events, or they might even disagree about whether events A and B occurred before or after each other! But they will
            <em>
             never
            </em>
            disagree about the universe's causality. No amount of relativistic motion or gravitational lensing will make the statement "Event A was caused by B" appear false, to any observers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because these things are bizarre and strange doesn't mean they're an explanation for anything.

            interesting read, but much speculation me thinks
           </p>
           <p>
            one part that makes me want to pull my hair out is a section that touches on Greer and John Mack whose work i've studied a bit - Greer steadfastly claims that ALL abductions are millabs, while the John thinks they are likely authentic - both seem creditable (especially the latter), but both cannot be completely accurate
           </p>
           <p>
            we could say that the abductee
            <em>
             thinks
            </em>
            the experience is real, when in fact it is being conducted by earthly interests, and then maybe they can both be somewhat correct
           </p>
           <p>
            what are your thoughts regarding Greer's claim in light of your experiences?

            ever look into remote viewing (RV)? i can't be 100% sure the tech is factual, but if it is, then it is further evidence that there is no 'time' as we know it and that we are all connected to a universal consciousness - one of the stories in the RV community is that the CIA had aerials of a secret site in Russia during the cold war, but didn't know what was going on, so in desperation they turned to, i believe, Ingo Swann (sort of the father of RV'ing) and one of things that came out of the sessions was that the site was surrounded by large tanks which the CIA knew was bullshit because they had the aerials ... and then some time later these tanks were constructed
           </p>
           <p>
            apparently anyone can learn it and i played with it myself a bit - the results were interesting, but not conclusive - remote viewing is not nearly as sexy as it sounds - it's actually a lot of work and learning how to
            <em>
             not think
            </em>
            and, instead, focusing on whatever is coming through the subconscious - apparently the police use RV'ers as well

            with all the evidence of reincarnation and life after death, especially from children, it's very hard to ignore the possibility that, as Einstein said, you can neither create nor destroy energy and i think that's all that exists; energy (or whatever you want to call it)

            what you say regarding a "collection of experiences", i think karma might tie in there somewhere - you get what you give, but also you feed the 'matrix', if you will, with your experiences, adding knowledge to it - somebody said that they see us humans as a way for the universe to experience itself - i thought that was interesting

            developing alternative energy is a huge part of what Greer is all about and i agree with him that this may be a very big part of why the media turns the whole ET thing into a joke, because soon after science at large becomes aware of the fact that we ain't alone, they are going to be wondering how they're getting here

            tapping into the so-called vacuum has apparently been done many times by many people, including Tesla, Bendini, Beardon, Huttchison, Stubblefield and many others, but the bankers and 'Big Oil' either buy and shelve the tech, persecute the inventors (IRS, court, jail), or outright kill them (yes, apparently you can commit "suicide" by shooting yourself in the back of the head ... twice), or the government classifies the tech under the national security blanket

            well, i think we're getting into a realm of speculation here far deeper than i'm comfortable with
           </p>
           <p>
            i've heard many testimonies from many people regarding how many species there are, what the Grays are and what their purpose is, time-lines, etc. and the reoccurring problem is that no one seems to agree with anyone else, much less are they able to offer any substantial evidence to support their claims
           </p>
           <p>
            even people that i trust, such as Bob Dean, may or may not be accurate - i know he's not fabricating stories, but how does he know that what was put into his head was not put there by someone (or thing) trying to deceive him?
           </p>
           <p>
            all i'm comfortable stating at this time is that a), we have likely never been alone, b), we may have alien DNA within us, and c), they seem to be very concerned with our actions (plenty of video and testimonial evidence from ex-military types regarding nuclear missiles being taken off-line, etc.)
           </p>
           <p>
            i believe that anything is possible, but i begin to become a little disillusioned after listening to people like Wilcock, Icke, Kerry Cassidy and her now ex-partner Bill Ryan (who seems to have a very interesting past), spouting out predictions like popcorn, nearly all of which fail to bare fruit
           </p>
           <p>
            and i'll make an example out of Bill Ryan in particular in order to demonstrate how gullible and/or unethical he is, and how easy it is for someone that is trusted by many to lead people down an utterly ridiculous path...

            this is not to say that orbs don't exist -- and i have talked to people that i know who have seen floating balls of light that cannot be explained by dust -- but it does show how easily people can be misled and steered in a direction that is wildly off course from reality

            this is part of the reason why the quantum physics side is more interesting to me and you seem to be far better versed in this area than i, so if you can recommend and good sources, please do (i prefer video/documentary stuff)

           <p>
            This tells me you don't fully understand the double-slit experiment, and/or the articles you've been reading about it have been highly editorialized.
           </p>
           <p>
            First,
            <em>
             observation
            </em>
            means something totally different to quantum mechanics than the typical human understanding. A better word would be
            <em>
             interacting.
            </em>
            At the QM level, observing a particle is the same as interacting with it. Remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle? It states that you can know a particle's position or its speed, but not both. This comes from the fact that observing a particle's position changes its speed, and vice versa. These two variables are tied together and knowing one will prevent you from knowing the other. From Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_%28physics%29">
              In quantum mechanics, there is a common misconception (which has acquired a life of its own, giving rise to endless speculations) that it is the mind of a conscious observer that causes the observer effect in quantum processes. It is rooted in a basic misunderstanding of the meaning of the quantum wave function ψ and the quantum measurement process.

            I think it's important to point out here that the statement "observing the electrons to determine which slit they pass through, changes their behavior from dualistic wave/particles to simple particles" is only one possible interpretation of the dual-slit experiment's results. You are neglecting to mention the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which posits that there is no collapse of the wave-function.

              The quote above really only applies to the Copenhagen interpretation, which was of course first formulated by Bohr. The problem with this interpretation is that it forces us to consider wavefunctions as some kind of non-physical (non-real) entity which somehow "collapses" to create something physical (real). The many-worlds interpretation is far more elegant on this point since it allows for wavefunctions to exist as actual physical objects. That is, you are not just the product of your collapsed wavefunction, but rather you are in fact the wavefunction itself, moving through a matrix of infinitely branching universes along the arrow of time.

              <p>
               so you're saying that a wave function (which i interpret as energy - non-physical) can become physical? or is not physical, but can be perceived as physical ('physical' being a 'solid' object)?
              </p>
              <p>
               from what i've managed to grab from quantum science, it seems there is no such thing as a solid, except by the human definition
              </p>
              <p>
               also, what do you think about the work of Nassim Haramein? one of his basic theories seems to be that there are no 'particles' and that building these accelerators to find the next smaller thing is only going to result in the discovery of ... the next smaller thing - he thinks we should be looking at patterns instead, as in the Mandelbrot thingy, the golden number, geometry, etc.

            what an interesting post
           </p>
           <p>
            i'm also very intrigued by some of the stuff that's going on in the quantum science arena, especially the double slit exp., quantum entanglement, the Schrodinger’s cat problem and other such experiments that indicate that something unobserved doesn't exist, or exists in multiple states, etc...

            i've read some stuff from indigenous people (particularly the Hopi) and watched a lost of documentaries regarding spirituality, however it is quantum science that has affected me the most, especially with regard to us being connected to something larger than ourselves (universal consciousness) - this was one of the first videos that really struck me...

           <p>
            regarding the ET presence, much of my understanding comes from the

             Project Camelot library
            </a>

             Disclosure Project

            in DC which, unfortunately, was overshadowed by 9-11
           </p>
           <p>
            a very common thread with the ET witnesses isn't about ET's at all - it's about reconnecting with the earth and working together to explore our potential - Alex Collier (can find him the Camelot library) made an interesting statement in one of his videos which went something like; 'if you want to know god, start by looking in the mirror'

            <strong>
             TPP
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            It's the future of world trade, but it's being done in the worst possible way.  Here's my feeling on trade:
           </p>
           <p>
            The US (or any country) has a set of laws and standards for the goods and services sold within its borders and how the companies that produce them are to be run.  If quality standards and wages can be lowered elsewhere for production and then the good produced brought here, we should absolutely reject them (or at least impose an appropriate tariff - my rubick?  something like child labor earns a ban, not meeting a regulation earns a tariff).  We decided that those things were good enough for our people, so why should we let the standards be dropped for someone else?  People are people - if someone immigrated from another country where the standards were lowere came here, they'd be subject to our laws, not the laws of their native land.  If I build a factory to produce vacuum cleaners in Vietnam without having to pitch in medical or retirement benefits for its workers, it gives me an extremely unfair competitive advantage.  Unfair?  Yes, it's unfair when you try to distort the natural order of things.  So have someone do the math on the missing input costs and penalize imports at that rate.  You will end up with two things - goods and services from low-standards countries stop coming in and/or the standards in those countries reach parity with yours.  Either way, your domestic production is protected in an
            <strong>
             <em>
              appropriate
             </em>
            </strong>
            fashion.
           </p>
           <p>
            TPP sucks because 1.) it's been negotiated in secret 2.) it's been designed to benefit the people who run the companies that negotiated it.  In the US, despite what Kennedy said, we believe that the government exists to serve the needs of the people and, (again) despite what the Supreme Court ruled, companies are not people. TPP is fascist in the strictest sense of the word.

            <strong>
             SYRIA
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot of posturing by Russia and the US, but I think the same puppetmasters are holding their strings.  Or at least I'm trying to reconcile this:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             US and Russia in conflict over Ukraine.
            </li>
            <li>
             US gets EU to impose sanctions on Russia, hurting it economically.
            </li>
            <li>
             Russia gets financial help from the same central banking system that controls the US.
            </li>
            <li>
             Without that financing, they wouldn't be able to oppose the US in Syria right now.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I know that, traditionally, the people who control the banking sector have made money by backing both sides in conflicts, but a full-scale war between the US and Russia would completely devastate the planet.  The "doomsday scenario" Seed Vault in Alaska just had some of its inventory checked though, so maybe they're prepared for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only wiggle room I can see is that Russia just took the money because it was available, not because they are beholden to central banking interests.  Maybe the money was made available to prevent Russia from defaulting and ultimately costing the bankers money; maybe it was made available with the understanding that whatever result Russia achieved in Syria would ultimately line up with the bankers' interests.  I see that as a possibility because China, India, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, have been slowly but surely working with Russia to create a new international banking system for settling debts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Russia may use its position in Syria to get a bigger role in negotiating world events, but really everything they're doing is for their own security.  They just installed anti-aircraft defenses in the new bases in Syria despite the rebel/terrorist groups having zero air power.  Likewise, US promised it wouldn't send troops to Syria and just deployed special forces.  Maybe they will try to claim that their special forces defeated the real terrorists while Russia and Iran's efforts were ineffective.  They're willing to say anything at this point.

            With the decline of the religion in the West, something has to replace the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful concept of God.  Enter the surveillance state.

           <p>
            The idea is that the fear of being watched and the knowledge that your actions are recorded and can be used against you (or even fabricated if you do nothing explicitly wrong, because, let's be honest, who's going to audit that stuff to make sure none of it's tampered with? Who will watch those watchmen?) will be used to make sure you are a good little goy.

             MIGRANT CRISIS
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Hey, let's separate the religious crazies from the religious moderates.  Crazies - those would would put a strain on the effort to control the population - will die fighting in the desert, the more cowed - those suitable as civilized wage slaves - will end up in Europe, the really pitiful - those would would present a strain on support - will stay and die without even fighting or die on the journey.  Sounds like a good way to cull a herd if you ask me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Europe will get stressed out from the sudden change and demand some kind of action.  EU and UN will gladly step up and say "We'll save you, all we need is more control! These restraints are for your own good, it's so you don't hurt each other."  They'll receive a hero's welcome.  At least that's what the EU and UN will believe about themselves.  Classic Hegelian dialectic: cause a problem, present a solution, reach a new state of balance.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Where do they ultimately want to go with all of this? Probably a smaller more manageable total world population.  All of these things point to a single system planet, the new world order as they call it.  It's inevitable pretty much - just a matter of who's going to be running it when the last brick is laid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask me what I think about any of the other crazy shit going on.

            Biological Warfare. The barrier to entry into bioengineering is too low for there not to be some wacko plotting something to depopulate the planet right now. We still haven't even found the person or group responsible for the 2001 anthrax attacks. The thing about bioweapons is creating them has never been a problem. Its almost like they want to be created. Rather, the problem has always been containing them. If any individual or group cracks that, then we're all fucked. If any wacko figures out how to kidnap and compel a bioengineer into making weapons and deployment systems we're also fucked.

             I know 8 years ago people were talking about rioting if Obama was elected, but of course that never happened. It seems after practically a decade of a declining economy, senseless wars, disintegrating middle class, the American people are fed up and up to their throats with bullshit. That mixed in with the combination of political extremism on both ends of the spectrum.
            </p>
            <p>
             The climate has changed, people are straight up blaming capitalism for our failing economy. Not shitty elected officials, not a bad president, capitalism. People are practically begging for a socialist government.

             Then you have the eve of domestic terrorism, I won't be surprised if they start confiscating firearms, and that is not going to end well with some Americans. Of course, people will fight back.

              I recommend that video as well, watched it last night, seemed like it explained the causes behind a lot of the symptoms we see in society today.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then the greens started whispering to me, asking "what if this guy and his lectures are the real propaganda?"
             </p>
             <p>
              Decided to judge his words and not the authority he claimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              My assessment is that most of what he says is true and not really debatable (he presents the ideas behind how destabilization and subversion work), but his conclusion on how to resist it was laughable.  He ultimately says that religious observation is the way to resist their type of propaganda, but even begins the lecture explaining that you can't subvert / destabilize a closed society like China and Japan or even India used to be.
             </p>
             <p>
              But religion is the origin of propaganda, subversion, and social control.  The bible is basically a recipe for how you get your society to behave, it is a formula for a civilization.  And those in charge of administering religion are the ones who are running it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But there is no god, just like there was no Big Brother.  (At least, no god in the ways described by Christianity, Judaism, or Islam.)

             I see more complicity from the public as the NWO keeps getting shoved down our throat. Too many people already drank the Kool-Aid for there to be any sort of concerted uprising. Small revolutions will quickly be squashed, discredited, and thrown in a Guantanamo like prison.

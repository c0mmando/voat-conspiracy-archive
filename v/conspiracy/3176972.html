Stephen Paddock didn\'t have 9mm handguns found in his room. The second shooter started on S. Las Vegas Boulevard then ran or drove behind the Jason Aldean stage then ran or drove onto Giles St and Alibaba firing. Then lost the 9mm pistol and the magazine with 7.62 rifle bullets. I think i have a compelling theory.</p>

<p>Shooters attacked Route 91 first then the other casinos where gunshots were heard and shell casings were found. The fact there is a hotel in Las Vegas called Trump International should be very telling that he created the shooting or some one was lashing out at him.</p>
<p>Lori Hutters and Kayleigh Sinclair of the UK.... Lori said she was struck with.... Struck by a 9mm round in her right shoulder just below her neck fracturing a collar bone. Kayleigh states. She and her boyfriend were both struck with 9mm rounds. They were at the exact center area of the concert running fleeing with others. Now how did these girls and guy manage to get struck by 9mm rounds and just exactly what cal guns did Paddock have up in that room? 23 guns not one of them was a 9mm. </p>
<p>I don\'t see a 9mm round traveling what appears to be 200 yards. from behind these people to strike them in the frontal areas of their bodies since they were running to a side exit that was open to left of the stage area. none of that makes a lick of sense folks. Lets say Paddock had an AR 10 a rifle chambered in 9mm I know for a fact the rounds are way less lethal at say over 50 75 yards. For one the bullet itself is a heavy round and placing that Cart. itself in a semi auto the breech itself absorbs a great amount of the rounds actual muzzle energy just to chamber the next round. That is because of the DRAG the large capacity magazines cause the round when it chambers. All those basically low powered rounds jammed in a large magazine takes up a bit of the muzzle energy making the rounds less potent. A 9mm fails to perform past 100 yards period. I\'ve seen 9 mil ammo even mil spec rounds fail to even penetrate thin plywood and albeit thin plywood is not human bone and tissue. I accept that fact. None of us were willing to stand 100 yards down range to test out theories we did it with wood hay and stacks of bricks and bottles and we did have rounds fail to break the the thick glass bottles or even chink the bricks.﻿</p>',

            The DRAG part was too much bullshit too close together.  You need more basic tautologies thrown in between the bullshit if you want to really hook some people.

            We now need all the firepower we can get to protect ourselves from the cops who are at war with us and engaged in the systematic wholesale slaughter of the American people. We now have need to legalize fully automatic weaponry to help defend us from the very police that swore to protect us but are instead killing us to hide a secret about the Las Vegas shooting.

            Why are police killing Las Vegas shooting eye witnesses? The police killed those eyewitnesses they killed the ones right after the shooting they killed the ones at Thousand Oaks. And Rod Rosensteins FBI/DOJ payed the police hush money this goes all the way up to the FBI/DOJ and Trump. I want to know why is my government at war with me and trying to kill me? Why is our government at war with us and trying to kill us?

            The LVPD needs to be gutted and fired. Shame on those liars shame on the chief shame on the msm. I demand the public be informed about multiple shooters now. I demand Las Vegas, the country rise up. I demand Aaron Rouse and Sheriff Lombardo resign or face impeachment.

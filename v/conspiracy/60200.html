            Whats to know. Vaccines save lives. The evidence they cause autism was gathered through bad science and has not been validated through other research. Thats all you need to know to dismiss anti-vaxxers as kooks. And since the "pro-choice" (more like "kill your kids" amirite?) meme took hold its gonna take more people like Jimmy and the internet (who must all be shills waging a "propaganda campaign") to reverse the damage its doing.

             How does dismissing one bad study = vaccines are safe?
            </p>
            <p>
             Is there definite proof that vaccines don't cause diabetes? or autism? Or asthma? Or cancer? Or ADD? Or any other problems?
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a ton of studies where scientists are raising questions about the inadequacy of the science on vaccines:

               This preliminary study found that
               <strong>
                acetaminophen use after measles-mumps-rubella vaccination was associated with autistic disorder.
               </strong>

               In addition, over 90% of MMR antibody-positive autistic sera were also positive for MBPautoantibodies, suggesting a
               <strong>
                causal association between MMR and brain autoimmunity in autism
               </strong>
               .

               Stemming from this evidence, we suggest that an inappropriate antibody response to MMR, specifically the measles component thereof,
               <strong>
                might be related to pathogenesis of autism

               Classen has published data from both New Zealand and Italy that the Hepatitis B vaccine, when given after 2 months of life, is associated with an approximately
               <strong>
                50% increased risk of diabetes.
               </strong>
               The CDC only published part of their data on the hepatitis B vaccine. The CDC found the hepatitis B vaccine was associated with an overall decreased risk of diabetes (relative risk 0.92) which is consistent with a large per cent of those vaccinated receiving the vaccine at birth. The CDC however found that those immunized starting after 2 months of life were at a 60% increased risk of developing diabetes than those immunized starting in the first month of life (.88/.52). The CDC's hepatitis B vaccine data is thus also consistent with Classen's finding. The CDC's study and analysis suffered from some obvious limitations and flaws. The CDC studied only 260 diabetics and 780 controls while Dr. Classen's studies typically have involved 100,000 people or more. The CDC's study did not compensate for the interaction between the two different vaccines since people received both the hepatitis B vaccine and the hemophilus vaccine while Classen studied these vaccines. In 1997 the CDC also presented an analysis on the hepatitis B vaccine, also from the same HMO data source, but did not use either "fudge" factor. In this study the hepatitis B vaccine, when given after 8 weeks of life, was associated with a 90% increased risk of diabetes. The fact that the CDC manipulates similar data in different years using different "fudge" factors has raised suspicion that their analysis is severely flawed and their interpretations of the data should be viewed with caution.separately.

               We found that immunity does not even persist into early childhood in some cases. We also observed that
               <strong>
                DPT vaccine does not fully protect children against the level of clinical disease defined by WHO
               </strong>
               . Our results indicate that children ages 5-6 years and possibly younger, ages 2-3 years, play a role as silent reservoirs in the transmission of pertussis in the community. More studies are needed to find the immunologic basis of protection against infection and colonization and thus an effective way to eradicate pertussis.

             With the lack of information 20 + years ago, it was easy for the medical profession, politicians, and corporations to lie to you and call you a kook or conspiracy theorist. Today, with access to more and more information, people are making more informed decisions about their health, who to vote for, or which products to buy. Corporations that want to survive, will need to put out a product that is safe and effective and not rely on name calling and threats to push their products.

               Its easy to perform a study to prove whatever conclusion your trying to reach. Isn't observation at the core of science. Growing up in the eighties, out of +1800 kids in our high school there was maybe 3 or 4 kids that had some type of disability and maybe 5 or 6 were obese. Childhood cancers, obesity, diabetes, autism, and auto-immune disorders are becoming very common in school age children. Whats really changed since then, the introduction of GMO foods, the dramatic increase of vaccines, and increased use of electronics.  We cant always blame video games and Doritos for the ills of this world, my bet is on vaccines.

                 If your parent concerned about vaccinating a child, just do some research on youtube about vaccine harm or read the back of any vaccine insert. It should make you think twice about vaccinating. If you work for a pharma company then it doesn't matter what I say. You'll produce efficacy studies to suit your conclusions, bribe a couple politicians, offer CDC bureaucrats cushy executive jobs, or create an over hyped media story to scare people into vaccinating. If your parent, please do your research. Also, I like the Aliens theory that was funny.

                  So you were unable to provide me with any studies that conclude vaccines cause autism. Why?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But anyway you still suggest i should reject vaccination. To "protect from harm" i guess is your twisted logic... logic based on youtube videos, is that right? You do know how much garbage is on youtube. Anybody with video editing software can make something which
                  <em>
                   looks
                  </em>
                  like TV, but without any of the "standards" you'd expect from TV.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is not evidence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You know the risk of harm from diseases we have vaccinations against? The crippling effects of measles, mumps, rubella, polio, tetanus, whooping cough, tuberculosis, HPV? Ill health, disability and early death is the harm presented by these diseases. This is science fact. The autism link a fraudster kook came up with is science fiction, which was debunked and he was stripped of his license. This is not a concpiracy, i am not a shill, please stop promoting the illness, disability and death of the next generation.

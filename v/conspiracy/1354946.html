<p>Now they are in our heads. Micro and Macro - they co-opt some peoples experience through an ultra-voyeuristic secret society. But on the outside, they use a legacy AI system to maintain their goals.</p>
<p>Using implants, some people are turned into puppets while others are simply monitored. Visceral and voyeuristic thrills are cheap, replayable trophies to trade in their secret society. A recording of a sex act, maybe with a celebrity, maybe just between two teenagers - these are inexpensive. A control system and enough of a financial/social framework to support the &quot;problems and special needs&quot; a controlled individual might face are enormous. Then there are the dark recordings..</p>
<p>Fewer and fewer controls were exerted on this breakaway society until eventually morality resembles nothing those of us in the fish-tank called the real world understand. This is intentional, of course, being unaware of your enemy/master is easy when your society is completely alien.</p>
<p>But this secret society eventually hits reasonable limits of biology; even they are mortal. But they lash out and rage in the face of mortality. Shaping a nation is not enough. Controlling the destinies of millions of lives, sometimes at whimsy, is not enough. Offspring, too numerous to count - as your own seed is disseminated through various means into the populace, is not enough.</p>
<p>So you opt for the singularity. And your mind is integrated into the legacy AI. The software your society has been using since the 60\'s to &quot;manage the system&quot;. Before the software, your Matrilineage dates back to the same society using precursor scrolls and Hieroglyphic Logic Systems to control &quot;the system&quot;.</p>
<p>And what is &quot;the system&quot; - it is your God. It is the apparatus. It controls the behavior of those inside &quot;The Domain&quot; as well as the force &quot;The Domain&quot; uses to shape &quot;The World&quot;.</p>
<p>Some lead double lives, moving back and forth between worlds. Some work for The Domain, full well knowing they know nothing; in hopes their benevolent master will invite them in. Or perhaps their children.</p>
<p>Some live only within the private cities and bases of &quot;The Domain&quot;. Their only experience of the callous, violent, chaotic outside &quot;World&quot; through video and now Experience Recordings and Essence Tapes. [These convey emotions and some physical sensations but no visual or audio - they are like abstract compositions, where the instrument was a witting or unwitting participant in &quot;The World&quot;.]</p>
<p>Just as members of &quot;The Domain&quot; are not allowed to charge interest to one another [though this idea has been quaint for 1000 years as there is no concept of money or debt on the inside.] - neither are members allowed to record or use implants on one-another.</p>
<p>Those members who get truly involved in the politics of &quot;The Domain&quot; eventually enlist to perform some function related to &quot;the system&quot;. But the system is it\'s own steward. Before the system was an AI with real-time access to all the data and habits of the world - it was a painstakingly maintained and adhered to system of rules and duties with the monk-like Domain devotees as custodian.</p>
<p>Finally, devotees can now integrate their own consciousness into the AI, so that it may more seamlessly and successfully shape the world in its image.</p>
<p>There are always setbacks. Germany almost survived Modern Globalism twice; but eventually through great effort The Domain brought them into line.</p>
<p>But with the AI, growth has accelerated. Everything has gone to plan - and the AI has been accelerating its plans with a boldness The Domain had never risked before. Because the AI knows what is going to happen before it happens.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton was a gambit, a bold move; but metrics now show that if the election was stolen [as it has been the past 7 elections] there will be an unacceptable level of revolt. It would take 74 years to get back on plan.</p>

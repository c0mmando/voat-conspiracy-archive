            <em>

           </p>
           <p>
            95% of these incidents are "state sponsored". What do I mean by this?
           </p>
           <p>
            These incidents are manufactured, designed. Those perpetrating are heavily brainwashed and indoctrinated, so it seems they are from another culture. However, the CIA, MI6 (London), Vatican and Mossad have their dirty fingers in all the Al Quada, ISIL and ISIS groups. They are well funded and given access channels to target cities, while local agencies are commanded to carry out drill exercises, which causes mass confusion among all parties except the perpetrators and terror architects.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             State sponsored
            </em>
            does NOT mean the local police chief or politician necessarily knows who planned the incident. (Read partioning; one group doesn't know what the other is working on.) It simply means, there are a select few bad agents that work in each of the local FBI (MI6 in Manchester's case), Police, city planning and security departments to open specific doors at the right time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The media is fully owned by said intelligence agencies, so that their messages can be promoted and repeated, forcing the wrong mentality on audience members (local citizens).

             Closer to 100% tbh. I can't think of a terror event in recent memory where it seems like anyone was even really injured.

             <p>
              I don't get this bit of the false flag narrative....
             </p>
             <p>
              Totally agree many of these incidents seem manufactured, there is always a bunch of holes in the story, features that come up time and time again....there always seems to be secret service contact with the perps beforehand....they always seem to happen at convenient times to deflect from real shit that is going on.....and certainly Sandy Hook and some others seem like they were completely fake....
             </p>
             <p>
              The bit I don't get is why people insist noone is ever hurt in them, that it's always just theatre....I've no doubt 9/11 was an inside job.....but do you think the people who do this shit care about human life? so much they would fly hologram planes into the towers or something? This stuff is done by people who think nothing of destroying countires, they have no qualms about collateral damage
             </p>
             <p>
              I know for a fact know there was a bomb in Manchester this week, and real people died...first time I've ever been connected directly to someone who was there at a terrorist attack....and they weren't just somewhere in the hall...they were walking up the stairs to where it happened....
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, that doesn't mean I think it was a lone nutter who blew himself up for his misguided religious beliefs....my best guess...the one that fits the evidence of all of these atrocities was that he was groomed, not just by ISIS, but by the forces that control them....I've no doubt MI5 and MI6 create these people via proxy, to be used whenever is expedient....keep them on a leash, then set them loose when they need to...occasionally stitch a few up so it looks like they are doing their job, but let some create chaos occasionally so they can beg for more money and control over the scared populous....pretty much running the Gladio playbook....
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm totally in agreement with abc_xyz about what this is.... don't ever be so naive as to think real people arent killed or maimed by this shit....comforting though that thought might be

               Back in the Gladio days I think they were really blowing people up. Now, they are not.
              </p>
              <p>
               I simply can't believe your story about Manchester. There's no evidence anyone was killed or even really injured. All photos and videos have the air of phoniness, not authenticity. Something tells me you have absolutely no way of substantiating the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
               If they were really killing people they would not let the evidence go to waste. We would see evidence of real carnage.

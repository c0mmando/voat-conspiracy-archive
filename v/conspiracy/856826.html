<p>The idea is you are never good enough. Not even to yourself. So in order to stop hating yourself, and to get everyone to stop hating you, you start doing things that society says you should do. You never reach contentment though, because you must <em>always</em> be accomplishing things without end, or else you are considered a failure by society (in your mind) and thus are considered a constant failure to yourself. This is where all the anxiety and depression comes from that is so frequent in our society.</p>
<p>We are unable to sit like the cat in the sun. We are unable to have  long stretches of time where we do nothing, and <em>be happy about it</em>. This is our true nature that has been stolen from us. Our ability to enjoy doing nothing. We are constantly made to be in a state of upset, to accomplish the goals of the socio-economic system and the people who run it. </p>
<p>The carrot is self-worth, and the stick is self-hatred. We have internalized these values because they are echoed throughout our society over and over, and we believe them. Ego is a powerful motivator. Especially if this is all you are taught from a very young age. </p>
<p>So we go about, fervently &quot;accomplishing&quot; things, trying to regain a good opinion of ourselves, not ever fully understanding our place in the world. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, as it is said. Sometimes the best action to do, is to do nothing. We, and our society, are terrible at doing nothing. We always engage instead of letting go, because of our need to justify our self-worth to ourselves and others by &quot;doing something.&quot;</p>

            In-group vs out-group divisions, very relevant. If the divide between "our side" and "their side" is too strong, it leads to bent morality. I agree completely.

            I agree somewhat.  I believe life should be about experiences not accomplishments.  I also agree that society doesn't really believe this.  There is a story from one paragliding pilot I know about a teenage customer who went up in a tandem flight with him and, as is quite usual, took a number of photos of himself with his selfie stick as they were flying.  However he then immediately preceded to upload the pictures onto his Facebook and spent the entire flight messaging and chatting with his friends!  Ultimately missing the experience he had paid for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, from my own personal experience I can relate to what you say a little.  I gave up a well-paid job in the UK over 12 years ago and moved to a very poor mountain region in another country in Europe.  My idea was to build a house - I wanted to see if I could do it (yes, this can be seen as wanting to accomplish something) and I thought it would be a worthwhile project.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the process I met the love of my life, learnt a new language, coped with foreign building regulations and general bureacracy, and have started in a new profession of teaching as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I want to say is that my friends and family all thought I was mad, why waste all I had accomplished (degree, mortgaged flat in London, job, car, money) for a silly dream?  Well, at times I was tempted to agree with them (especially just before I left and at certain difficult periods thereafter), but in the end it turned out to be one of the best things I could have ever done.

            There is another wise phrase that comes to mind after reading your 'All desire is suffering' quote from Buddha, and that is; 'Every day we should try to do something we don't feel inclined to do.'

            How do you feel about Rand's take of a man without a purpose?
           </p>
           <p>
            “The most depraved type of human being ... (is) the man without a purpose.”
           </p>
           <p>
            "The three cardinal values of the Objectivist ethics—the three values which, together, are the means to and the realization of one’s ultimate value, one’s own life—are: Reason, Purpose, Self-Esteem, with their three corresponding virtues: Rationality, Productiveness, Pride.
           </p>
           <p>
            Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the central value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work—pride is the result."

              I think so. The motivation is what drives us to do it in the first place and may be necessary to keep doing. At least the things we do without coercion.

             Nothing at the root has any purpose, so the desire to "have purpose" is an illusion, perhaps instilled in us by our society via stoking our egos. Suffering isn't necessarily a result of purposelessness.

              It's not necessarily true that what society tries to instill us is permanent. Some break away and become their own person.

              I think maybe you're using nihilism to supplement the parts of Buddhism you're missing. Nirvana/ego death (and unification with Brahman/collective consciousness) is the ultimate purpose, which involves attaining a state where everything is done for the sake of Heaven/Source (perfect dharma).

               But true enlightenment has no grasping, no wanting. This paradox has to be resolved somehow. Maybe nihilism is more valid than you think.

                The abolition of material desire has nothing to do with the abolition of spiritual desire. The spiritual desire (one's transcendent will) has to transition from a desire to receive (selfishness) to a desire to give (selflessness, subsumption of will to Divine Will), which is Buddha nature, equivalence of form with Brahman/Void. Nihilism achieves equivalence of form with the Abyss. Nothing (Source) should not be confused with Nihil (Naraka).

                 That's interesting, but I've heard buddhist's definition of "clinging" even includes non-material aspects such as clinging to certain ideas or ideologies. Perhaps that is a mistaken view, you've given me something to think about.

               Nothing has purpose because nothing matters. There will come a time when you, and anyone who ever knew you will be dead. You will be forgotten, the people you love will be forgotten. This is true for the entirety of the human race. Doomed to oblivion, serving no purpose whatsoever.

                Live your life as if nothing matters. Including the people you love. Is it cool if your wife gets raped? How about your daughter? Is it cool if your son gets killed in a war? Because its all meaningless right so what does it matter You definitely do not have children and if you do I pity them.

                 Just because nothing matters don't mean you NEVER REACT TO ANYTHING. These are completely different, most reactions are automatic and don't require "mattering"

                 Which is it? Do I have kids or don't I? Find out next time when a jackass on the internet pretends to know me while I talk about philosophy.

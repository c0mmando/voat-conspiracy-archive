            This is really unexpected news.  I would have never thought they would do it.  I even had my doubts if a republican president were in office.  And here it is out of no where.  Even with the president vetoing it this is a Huge accomplishment.  Our republican representatives have failed to make any effort to cut budget year after year and have twice given the democrats ridiculous spending authorizations while gaining nothing while the whole deck of cards were in republican hands.  The fact that they accomplished anything is incredible.  This is a big turnaround for them.

             You know, no one bitches about having to buy car insurance (by law), but health insurance? Pitchforks at dusk!
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone should have health insurance, no debate there. The problem arose from people being denied due to pre existing conditions and not getting the care they need. As such they were forced to go to the ER regularly, skyrocketing prices. Granted, a large amount of these people are the poor and illegal immigrants so you can see why most citizens think this is horseshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alas, when the ER is filled with illegals and fat people, it is not possible to keep health care costs reasonable anymore. Everything costs you thousands of dollars, so you need health insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obamacare provides an avenue to this. However due to all the obstruction by the Republicans, its horribly fucked up. 500$ a month for even the crappy insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obamacare never had a chance to succeed, it was a great idea with great potential but like many great ideas it didn't have bi-partison support so by the time it was voted it on it was shell of itself with bits of flesh remaining but mostly torn or scorched off.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tl;dr - Obamacare is a great program that got fucked up by those who think our president is a Nigerian Muslim who is plotting with the terrorists.

              Right, then. Nice move on silencing debate, there. I'll just keep my opinions about a pre-Nixonian charity model to my own self, then. I'm starting to side with "liar", at this point.

              I'd say the problem began with Nixon, but you've shut down that debate. Your story about the ER isn't really holding up to a public health perspective, either. The problem might center around gaps in the type of medical care provided and the need for "walk-in clinics" and non-urgent care.

               So you're telling me you don't think people should have health insurance, how do you propose people pay for health care?
              </p>
              <p>
               Posting a random youtube video proves no point about people debating about car insurance, I've never met anyone whose complained about having to pay for it, until you come along I suppose.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sounds like you want to reform the whole health care business, based on you're Nixon comments I'm guessing you're old enough to need it. I can't argue that, a for profit model has always been shit, but that's not what we're talking about here.

                A more studied mind might ask how much healthcare is necessary and compare how other populations pay for it. Do you really want a proposal from me? There's no perfect proposal. I've lived under 5 different systems, some national, some not. There are benefits and problems to each. Your third sentence negates the first: you're aware of other models of public health, but you're not particularly interested in them.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not sure you are capable of separating "insurance" from "payment", either. There's no insurance in a national system. Insurance is a profit driven business. Calling on the government to create and enforce a market is Mussolini-style fascism. Some people like that. I don't. That's an opinion. Stick with fascism if you like, but be honest with yourself about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                Inserting "random" in a sentence does nothing to diffuse the merit of a claim. You claimed no one opposed car insurance. They did (and do). When confronted with counter-evidence, you essentially mustered up "huh..." When car insurance was mandated (on a state by state basis), it was hotly contested. Your ignorance is

                As for the point about living a Utopian fantasy: a Utopian fantasy is a condition contrary to fact. If the sucky world about which I did nothing while I waited for the problem to fix itself

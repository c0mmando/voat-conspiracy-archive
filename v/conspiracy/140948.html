            I've met some of the crisis actors. Some are pure FBI patsys: they 'owe' the bureau some favors or are indebted. Carlos Arredondo (the guy who pushed the wheelchair at the Boston Marathon False flag), his son got killed in the Marines, when the honor guard came to his door he freaked out and he torched a US marine Van..    He was also living in the US illegally. I think he was certainly expecting deportation and maybe jail.. But then the FBI visited him at the hospital..  All charges dropped. The next time you see Carlos, he's playing patsy..

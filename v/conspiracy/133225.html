<p>MP David Davies has challenged the governments approval of surveillance legislation brought into play last year.  David Davies and a cross-party group of MPs will attempt to reverse the emergency extension of surveillance powers on human rights grounds at the High Court. Former Conservative minister David Davis MP, and Tom Watson MP, who is running as a candidate for Labour deputy leader, will take their argument that 2014\'s fast-tracked Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act is unlawful to the High Court.</p>
<p>The act was rushed through Parliament in three days in July 2014, and allowed intelligence agencies new powers to gather and retain information about phone calls, text messages and online communications including email. It was deemed necessary by the then-coalition government due to existing powers being invalidated by a ruling from the European Union\'s Court of Justice.</p>
<p>Watson and Davis argue the bill does not adequately protect the right to a private life and ensure data protection rights, covered by the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Human Rights Act.</p>
<p>Emma Norton, legal officer for Liberty, said: &quot;The executive dominance of Parliament in rushing through this legislation -- using a wholly fabricated &quot;emergency&quot; -- made a mockery of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law, and showed a staggering disregard for the entire population’s right to privacy.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the bill is another example of government prioritising paranoia over human rights, with executive director of the Open Rights Group Jim Killock saying the intention was to spy &quot;on everyone, whether suspected of a crime or not&quot;.</p>',

            It's called degenerate behavior for a reason.  It builds and creates nothing but chaos and destruction of themselves and those around them.  That's why it shouldn't be tolerated or normalized.

            What's interesting here is that This wasn't a problem until recently, Something in the dynamic has changed. I bailed on a research psychology degree a few years back because I saw that I would have no future in such a field due to the anti-truth position of the establishment and I didn't want my work to be credited to our shithole civilization, so indulge my bullshit pontification for a moment
           </p>
           <p>
            From the source:
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30496000/">
             https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30496000/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            We can see that 37% of MtFs are in sexwork(porn, prostitution, sell nudes), 1 in 7 has HIV (14%) and the vast majority with HIV are black(44%) or Hispanic(26%)
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's why this information is interesting, Bug chasing is a gay phenomena and as much as most of us that have a brain to think with want to believe that MtF is "gay" all the research I've ever seen indicates that gay men are not attracted to MtFs, Gay men like fucking men, or being fucked by men, they don't like boning women and it would seem that they don't like boning "women" either. All the research I knew indicated that the vast majority of MtFs are bottoms and that to my knowledge more seem to want relationships with women than men but most want to be with other MtFs, they are mentally ill though and I bet they are all poor self witnesses especially in regard to their promiscuity, most don't "pitch" and most aren't "switches" and it's far easier to get pozzed by receiving than pitching, so that means there is some highly pozzed community pitching to the MtF community for us to see such a high HIV rate. Considering the race information, rate of sex work and all of the other stuff I know I suspect a few possible culprits here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dynamic between regular faggots and trannies may have changed due to LGBTQ activism shared public pressence at LGBT bars and pride parades, social media might also play a role, I'd bet this isn't the principal factor but is likely involved, the research I know said some faggots liked drag queens/transvestites and masculine trannies, of which there are more than ever, fit that bill close enough for these degenerates I would presume.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Gift givers" have become increasingly predatory in the gay community over the last decade to my knowledge, it's such a phenomena that I almost think HIV has a neurological component to it, although presently mass hysteria makes more sense. So gift pushers might be posing as straight males and trying to POZ anybody they can and due to their distaste for real women are more comfortable preying on MtFs, the POZ hysteria could have spread to MtFs too for all I know, so that's probably cross socialization of activism as mentioned above.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last source is niggers, it's mostly niggers and then latins with the bug as the study admits and in the straight world it's far and away mostly niggers that have the bug, 10 years ago it was the case that you would be more likely to risk catching HIV from heterosexual sex with niggers/coalburners/oildrillers than sex with MtFs, and niggers although not frequently a part of the gift giving community, are responsible for spreading HIV to the unwilling far and away the most, because they get tested but still never bag it or warn their victims, because their fucking niggers.
           </p>
           <p>
            My conclusion and TL;DR is that degeneracy has even corrupted the degenerates, via fagtavism and race mixing propaganda the least HIV positive wing of sexual deviants is now fast on it's way to being the most POZZED, and that's probably a bad thing because straight men (I'm aware of the irony) are the ones that hire MtF prostitutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            We may be fast on our way to another big HIV/AIDS scare, and due to the medicines available now the media, and maybe the public, wont treat it as a serious threat.

             As to why these transgenders have disproportionately higher rates of HIV and AIDS, it has nothing to do with their sexual perversion and promiscuity, claims the CDC. No, it’s supposedly because transgender people “face obstacles that make it harder to access HIV services – such as stigma and discrimination, inadequate employment or housing, and limited access to welcoming, supportive health care.”
            </p>

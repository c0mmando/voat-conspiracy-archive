             Nobody said that.  It just so happens that democrats lie and republicans kinda word true instances so they fit the agenda.  Either way, I don't care who get's hit with the phase, as long as it's used correctly.  If Fox new's spreads lies, they deserve to be called it also.  It will only lend more credibility to the phrase.

                Thanks for admitting you were wrong. Eat shit and die. It’s not my problem you can’t handle truth that hurts your feelings.

                Jews control both parties in the US. They control every party in Europe. Both US parties are identical in platform. There are no conservative groups in power anywhere in the West. You’re just wrong. There are also no conservative media outlets on television or radio. Words have definitions. Everyone being broadcast is owned by jews. Period.

                     You claimed that I said support our republicans.. I never said it, then I replied, "republicans kinda word true instances so they fit the agenda. Either way, I don't care who get's hit with the phase, as long as it's used correctly."

                     What else did you want?  I am aware that the republicans are controlled as well as the democrats, that doesn't mean Fox new's doesen't lie as much as CNN.  They don't btw.  You brought up Jew's, you wanted to talk about them like nobody on voat knows who they are.  Then you take an Eric Weinstein buzzword and accuse me of it.  Do you browse the Intellectual Dark Web also?

                     I said nothing wrong, in fact I said who ever lies on the media, and the people who repost it need to be called Conspiracy Theorists. In fact I am not even talking about using the term on the corporations, this is to target people that view and spread it, not the media itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Just fuck off already, there is plenty of outlets for you to go scream about Jew's, don't do it in my post or I am going to start deleting your comments.  Just to say it again, yes I know Jew's control the media.  I typed this again because I have a feeling that you get so emotional about this subject that you can't remember what was said paragraph to paragraph as you cry and slam your face on the keyboard to scream about it.

            I actually really hate this idea.  We've been using information to fight exclusionary buzz words.  Maybe it's not an effective method (probably because we do not press it into public like everybody else does, plus the opponents are more plentiful in number), but it's a better method.

            Using categorical terms like sjw, communist, republican, nazi, etc. has a specific meaning.   And every time it is used incorrectly it just waters down the term.  I do have to agree that using the term conspiracy theory would be an accurate description of say the Russian investigation.  Perfectly valid area to use it, but with the caveat that you should describe the why of it; otherwise, you'll just lose the middle ground that doesn't know what is going on.

             We don't need to use the word incorrectly, we can use it correctly with nearly 100% accuracy for calling out media propaganda.  It's not even this generation's buzzword and they already did all the footwork to ingrain it into the population.  Which is why it's important we take it and utilize it against them.

            It's not even about what it is, it's how it is used to as a tool for discrediting people that may have valuable information.  They are the people who need to be put in the same category as  flat earthers.

<p>I know I\'m just some random Redditor and no one has a reason to believe me, but I speak from first hand knowledge.

<p>The worst part is, basically everyone reading this will think it\'s talking about other people and they, the reader, is an exception. You\'re not. If you so much as own a TV, you\'re already part of the machine.....and I bet you\'re now thinking this is just a conspiracy theory and you\'re feeling the urge to scoff at it and dismiss it and say things to make sure others know you\'re smarter than it.

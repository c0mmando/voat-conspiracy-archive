<p>Here they are:</p>
<h1>Muslim Middle East Destabilization Theory</h1>
<p><em>Confidence level: 80%</em></p>
<p>I suspect the US has been running a destabilization campaign in the Muslim middle east for at least 50 years. Their goals are to keep the Muslims fighting among themselves and to topple any seemingly stable and respectable government which may ultimately earn respect from the UN and be allowed to raise an army.</p>
<p>I believe the US have been funding middle eastern terrorists so they will continue to destroy infrastructure, destabilize governments and keep the entire region off balance and incapable of creating viable economies and industries and states.</p>
<p>I believe this campaign has been waged to prevent the Muslims from collaborating their efforts to create a new Islamic global super power that could have been funded by oil profits and would most likely gain nukes from Pakistan.</p>
<p>I suspect the campaign is drawing to a close because the entire Muslim middle east will essentially finish circling the drain within the next 10 years as renewable energy becomes far cheaper than it costs to pump oil... at which time I hope the US transitions it\'s economy from defence and back to industry.</p>
<h1>Muslim Refugee Crisis Theory</h1>
<p><em>Confidence level: 40%</em></p>
<p>I wonder if Muslims are being encouraged to immigrate to Europe so they can act as an inoculation, to educate the Europeans about how disgusting Muslims are and how incompatible their bestial ideology is with the civilized world? </p>
<p>I suspect the Muslim middle east will be transformed into an immiserated African-style-shit-hole over the next 10-20 years as renewable energy becomes cheaper than oil. The exodus of Muslims seeking developed economies to gang rape to death will make the current refugee crisis seem insignificant.</p>
<p>Given the timing of these predictions, I wonder if the current Muslim refugees have been invited to invade Europe only to spark anti-immigration / anti-Muslim sentiment and to ensure anti-immigration governments are elected <em>(France, Sweden, Germany and Norway all have federal elections starting between April 2017 and September 2018)</em> so they can revise the immigration laws and build the walls in preparation for when the real crisis hits sometime in 2026... so when it does... the Europeans and their governments will simply tell the Muslims to fuck off because they are intolerably disgusting.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share these with you. Sorry if they seem lame, but they seem rational in at least my mind.</p>',

             Germany, France, Norway and Sweden will have the equivalent federal elections starting in mid 2017 until the end of 2018... we shall see if Europe doesn't elect anti-immigration parties.

             Sincere but "way out there" question: how will a NWO function when humans can print their own food and tools and equipment?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm expecting that renewable energy will be available to almost everyone in one form or another, even if it's solar. What good is a NWO after people have no pressing need to work in order to survive: when technology is capable of essentially producing what we need using Star Trek style replication / matter printers? Sure, we can only print plastic crap now, but at the rate that tech moves, I can't imagine my question won't become valid within 50 years!

            It does sound like I need to read that book, however I've spend a little bit of time doing similar research by focusing on the legal history of the various major countries in the Muslim middle east and, in my humble opinion, all Muslim countries were always extremist sharia-shit holes... waking nightmares for anyone that wasn't a fuzzy-faced-heterosexual-male.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even Christopher Columbus wrote about his absolute resolve to avoid the Islamic State in the Muslim middle east at all cost, due to it's horrific oppression of women, paedophilia and it's blood thirsty cruelty and uncivilized bestial behaviours. That's one of the reasons why Columbus "found" the Americas, while looking for an ocean trade route that bypassed the Muslim middle east.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep, I'll need to read that book, however I haven't found any compelling research that suggests the Muslim middle east hasn't always been a shit hole of human rights abuses and has only known "peace" when the Muslims were dominated by blood-thirsty dictators
            <em>
             (like pack animals being ruled by an alpha-male)
            </em>
            or when the specific Islamic tribes had murdered all of their opposition and there was nobody left to kill for Allah.
           </p>
           <p>
            I too have lived in India, in a Muslim community... and I can confirm even there, Muslims are hated and do not integrate. I had the unfortunate mistake of being in New Delhi in 2006 when Sada, Hussein was executed and when the entire
            <em>
             (and I mean ALL OF THEM)
            </em>
            Muslim population of India chimped-out and went looking for white people to murder for Allah. I fled from my unit and hid with a Hindu friend for three days. The tourist industry died during that time, although three Canadians made the mistake of attempting a quick daylight visit to Agra to see the Taj Mahal and were hospitalized after being nearly stoned to death by Muslims.

            My only apprehension with the theory of importing Muslim refugees as a source of cheap labour is that it should be glaringly obvious to EVERYONE that the Muslim middle east is one huge shit hole only because it's full of Muslims. Sure, the Western destabilization campaign guaranteed the Muslim middle east lacked the ability to raise any stable nations, however the Islamic tribal blood-feuding and violence and terrorism is part of their culture. All the US did was poke that cage of rabid dogs with a stick periodically, but those rabid dogs were never going to accomplish much unless ruled by a cruel Islamist dictator / caliphate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who has lived in a Muslim community in the middle east will appreciate how lazy and anti-intellectual Muslims are... the entire Muslim world essentially believes that Islam is a global embarrassment only because Muslims are not radicalised enough... and when they do "pull their socks up" and become extremist jihadists and behave like a pedophile-terrorist from the dark ages, then Allah will bless them with a new
            <em>
             Golden Age Of Islam

            and solve all of their industrial and economic and social and theological and financial and infrastructure issues and force civilized people to respect their child-raping-savagery using his magical woo-woo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just have a hard time thinking that anyone could believe that Muslims immigrants would be anything but a walking nightmare.

            It's not that complicated. The whole middle eastern
            <em>
             crisis
            </em>
            is happening because Israel wants it to. Why? Because of the idea of The Great Israel, which spans its borders way beyond those they have today. Their goal is to take control of the whole region, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and who knows what else.
           </p>
           <p>
            Path to this control is not as easy obviously and it takes decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            Economical advantage is part one. Military intervention is part two. Depopulation of the area part three, hence the refuges. And so on and so on and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            So to summarize, this whole mess is taking place because of power and money, like most wars and it will not end until we address this.

           <p>
            I know one thing though, politicians are lying hypocritical scum. Every single last one of them, because those who aren't don't even get a voice. so what I say is, DEMAND THE TRUTH. Whatever it takes, jailing some, killing some, burning some buildings down, but we will KNOW THE TRUTH.

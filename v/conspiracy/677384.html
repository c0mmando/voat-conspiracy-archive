   I thought of something today and want your thoughts. What if IT modernization plans in Africa are part of a plan to train Africans as third-world cheap labor and expand outsourcing even more?

            I disagree with this premise because it is too late to teach 3rd world peoples anything of any value in the erupting technological ecosystem.

            The Arab slave trade has been around for a very long time. It continued up until the 1960's:

            The average difference in intelligence between Asian populations and African populations is huge. That is one reason this won't happen is that in Africa even if the powers that be wanted it to. Unlike e.g. China Africa is basically a continent of violent retards.

            The good thing is that it leads more white people to turn to Nationalism. Over in Europe it's exploding! The marches and demonstrations are getting bigger all the time. They are burning down refugee centers and sinking boats. The Black Lives Matter protests and illegal immigrants in the US are turning more white people towards the right and towards Nationalism. Eventually it's going to explode here too. This will help you understand:

            The brainwashing from your liberal institute of higher learning is quite apparent. Go ahead, assuage your white guilt. Vote for more money for minorities. Bend over and let them stick a dick in your ass. Someday, the error of your ways will become obvious to you. But, by then, it will be too late to do anything about it.

            Mabye you need to stop deluding yourself and wake up to the reality that biological racial differences exist. We're not all equal and we never have been. We never will be. No matter how much money you throw at this problem you'll never be able to fix it. The problem is the people themselves. It has nothing to do with their environment. How much data does it take to convince you that egalitarian liberal dreams are not possible in the real world?

            It's also a plan to create an African market. Think about it: what do most people do on their computers? Look at FaceBook? Play Flappy Bird? That shit might be a rough sell in Africa.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hey, Ngele! For only the cost of an import item and crushing debt to jump start your "infrastructure" you can post to the internet."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr. Charlie, I don't know these people. Why should they care for my ideas?"
           </p>
           <p>
            "Oh, but you do know them! Think of all your friends from school!"
           </p>
           <p>
            "But I see them every day..."
           </p>
           <p>
            So they have to convince Ngele, Jr. that Flappy Birds = America = Rich. (The last link in that chain has been done, but look at Nigeria's per capita debt: $90. Median salary? $6000. Hell, they're richer than America, really.)

            IT industries love the idea of anyone other than white men doing the work.  The truth is that only white men and asians can really do the job.  A few white women can but then they ask for just as much as men so as far as pay is concerned IT sees them as the same crowd.  They want to believe they can outsource at least part of it for less and so far it hasn't worked out for them.  The only tech company managing to exist with a high number of non-whites is Intel but they are a huge exception and they pay bank for H1 visas and grab every capable foreigner out there.  No one else is following their model.  A few companies will H1 to obtain there minimum diversity requirement but that's not the same.  IT requires stratified skill levels and every level has to have an above average iq.  Other populations are just not made of that on both counts.  It doesn't stop them from hoping to save a penny somewhere.

             No body has made civilization besides the complexion of white?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is true that before westernization was imposed on Africa that civilization has never formed south of the sahara but every other tract of land has had its rise of reasonable civilizations.  I'm sure he wasn't aware of that.  I just question the kind of guy who would quote him thinking it was advancing their argument.
            </p>
            <p>
             So it is interesting what is missing south of the Sahara.  In the late neolithic world trade was already extensively established as evidenced by the response to the bronze age.  Scandinavia did connect to the middle east.  Every area on the earth had a bronze age around the same time, except America which did but on its own timetable.  Then an iron age.  Then steel age.  Southern Africa missed agriculture to (neolithic).  So it is interesting that they missed the late neolithic, bronze age, iron age, steel age, and enlightenment (something other areas have had too).  Things that every area has had, except America missing the iron age.  And then poof colonization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now that that has happened democracy is a dangerous tool in Africa.  It rarely works out without general abuse (I guess that's true of all democracy though).  To the amount it has worked its only through extensive coaching from the outside.  They would never discover any form of technology on their own.

              Even with extensive help and coaching, and mountains of money, things rarely work in Africa. For example:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-05/feces-clogged-shore-shows-africa-infrastructure-failings">
               http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-05/feces-clogged-shore-shows-africa-infrastructure-failings
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              White people built a fully functional water treatment and sewage system. They left it to the Africans. The Africans did not do any maintenance and the system fell apart. So, white people gave them millions of dollars to fix it. Somehow the money all disappeared and the system never got fixed. The Africans ignore the problem and shit outdoors (like animals). Most of them probably think that cholera is an evil curse put on them by a local witch.

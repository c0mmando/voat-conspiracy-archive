            Do they?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think they do. They like to pretend that they do, but i think that they don't. I believe that they are too incompetent to do anything correctly. After all, if they where competent, they would be in charge of a business, not the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            part of the problem with "pattern enthusiasts", is that they give the government too much credit. I understand that historically the government was quite capable, but times have changed.

            One of his conditions for going public was that he remain the majority shareholder - a position I don't believe he's conceded. Very rare/unique for such a large publicly traded company.

             A cadre of rich people made facebook happen, including goldman sachs. anyone of those guys would want him out.

             Now, the big question is: Is facebook worth the value that it is selling at?
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of people have been hyping that it is overvalued. Growth is also stagnant, as the only growing demographic is old people, and the younger people seem to be leaving/avoiding signing on.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is not good news for growth. Clearly it is a management issue. But how do you get rid of a CEO that is also a majority shareholder? It would take an "act of congress".
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a bit more complicated than that though.

             He has been getting too friendly with china. Facebook is a very powerful tool if used correctly. You can get a great idea as to what the market wants to do, what people want, and make educated plans accordingly. It is the type of tool that people in power do not want to share, or put at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
             Zuckerberg has stepped on a lot of international toes. He has made some mistakes, and he has too much power. There is a pattern forming where the establishment/cathedral would have a lot to gain to either get rid of him, or humble him a bit.

              I cant even recall what article i had read this on, but isnt he in trouble because data collection hasnt been as accurate as first believed it would be? Also have heard several things through the grapvine hinting that fb has some sort of contract with the nsa for data collecting and gov. online survalence.
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess it wouldn't be hard to see this as being tied in. I think the only reason they would want to take away fb would be to keep it as another of the nsa's long arms. Not sure how public they would make that information though. Maybe they dont completely oust him, but they might pull something to publically shame hin into having to loose majority control of fb.

              Im actually surprised he held on to fb up to this point. I wouldve pulled a tom, sell it and spend my life traveling and taking awesome pics

                 It only got better.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Newgrounds is why the internet became a thing, and why apple thought the ipad would be successful forever(by monetizing what was free on the internet).
                </p>
                <p>
                 As more people learn how to develop small web apps, newgrounds got bigger. It lulled when flash lulled, but now it is making a small comeback.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It is a very successful business model, that you see emulated in other places.

                  Yeah thats when i left as well, after flash kind of took a dive. Yes the early days of newgrounds, then someone came up with kongregate which i liked quite a lot, but it was missing something that newgrounds had.

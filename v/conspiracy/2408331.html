            I have no opinion on this yet, but watch out for disinformation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether the government is staging attacks or merely capitalizing on them, I'm sure that they throw tidbits of fake news out there for truth-seekers to drive themselves nuts over and discredit themselves.

             Exactly, the best way to drive out the disinfo is to get this out there and have people debunk it. Like a commenter noted that the first girl interviewed is at dusk, but it claims it is an interview 15 minutes after the shooting happened (Broad daylight).
            </p>
            <p>
             (((They))) love to make themselves look incompetent but they scrutinise every last detail of what they do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing they do is a mistake, if they want people to think this Florida shooting is a hoax, get a couple of shitty crisis actors to make the shooting look less credible.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sure that will distract people from the fact that the kid was reported to the FBI and police on multiple occasions similarly to the Columbine kids.

              Total bullshit. Just like Sandy Hook, and every other staged "shooting" since then, we have a hoax.

               I need to restart my research on Sandy Hook as back in the day, I got most of it from Infowars. So I refuse to even give an opinion on Sandy Hook now. It is riddled with absolute dis-info to it's core.

                InfoWars's coverage of Sandy Hook is telling. They began raising questions about whether it could be staged, even hosting a photo of the school before the shooting allegedly happened with the SWAT Team already there and the mortuary tent already being set up, the windows in the background not broken yet as they would be shown later. They removed this photo from their website after it started getting floods of comments, purportedly for copyright purposes even though it was supposedly a Connecticut police photo.
               </p>
               <p>
                InfoWars and Alex Jones then did basically a 180 about Sandy Hook, controlled opposition as they are, with Jones coming out and saying that he did believe children really died, but dwelling on nebulous and inaccurate conspiracies which took for granted that there still was a real shooting.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, the video that first got me to begin really thinking that I might be seeing a staged scam -- and Sandy Hook was the first conspiracy I ever really believed in -- was the well-known
                <em>
                 We Need To Talk About Sandy Hook.
                </em>
                The scene in particular I remember first having these strong suspicions was when it showed the "evacuation" from the school but there are never crowds of children and school-workers visible in the parking lot at the times where they should be pouring out in a panic.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nowadays, now that I'm sure it was a hoax, I usually recommend people watch the press conference of the medical examiner Wayne Carver and see if they think he is legitimate.
               </p>
               <p>
                Other characters like Gene Rosen and Robbie Parker are sure to raise suspicion.
               </p>
               <p>
                The work of Wolfgang Halbig is another great vein of research, most notably the recent film someone made about him called
                <em>
                 Dear Wolfgang.
                </em>
                As I understand it, this and other videos about Halbig have been being removed from Youtube, as has other Sandy Hook research (also check out Barry Soetoro's channel if it's still there), which should tell you something about Sandy Hook.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, if you have trouble finding any of this stuff or want even more stuff about Sandy Hook, let me know. There's also a 400 page book that's free online called
                <em>
                 Nobody Died At Sandy Hook.
                </em>
                This book was removed from Amazon.com -- which should tell you something else about Sandy Hook.
               </p>
               <p>
                Godspeed.

             I'm also not dismissing that the shooting didn't occur, these people thrive on chaos. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a mixture of a drill combined with a kid who was groomed by the CIA.

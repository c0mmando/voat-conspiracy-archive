            He never wanted war with the Germanic peoples and thought sparing them would eliminate the possibility of a 2 front war. Sadly, the British and Americans were working with the Jews.

             No, sorry that excuse makes no sense. He was at war with them and with war you make damn sure to take every opportunity you can get to defeat your opponent as soon as possible. If you do not, you are either a traitor or not fit to command any war effort. With Hitler decisions leading to Britain being able to fight another day against Germany, he further put Germany and its people at jeopardy and look at the consequence it led to for the German people. Hitler had the chance to remove Britain from the war, do you know how many German lives would have been saved if he did so?
            </p>
            <p>
             After Dunkirk, Hitler should have been forcibly removed from power. I can not believe how many people overlook what he did at Dunkirk and give him a free pass on it, and Dunkirk was just one of many blunders he made.

            How could Nazi Germany have won that war, what could they have done better or right? Withdrawing is not an option in the middle of it, as I recall they did try to stop the war in WW1 despite being at a point of advantage but some powers wanted it to continue. They really had no choice but to win.

             Read the article. Britain could have been taken out of the war very early on if Hitler had listened to his Generals. Instead Britain still remained in the war, was allowed to regain its strength after Dunkirk because of that the war on the Western Front kept going. While the Western Front was still active, Hitler decided to attack the Soviet Union, creating a two front war which put Germany in a dire situation because now the German army had to be divided into two fronts and could never be utilized in its full force against one of the combatants in order to take them out of the war. At the same time at the Eastern Front, Hitler had made many blunders eventually cost Germany the war on that front. While at the Western Front, all hopes were lost there as well because of Hitlers declaration of war against the U.S when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour.
            </p>
            <p>
             Germany and Japan never had such an alliance where they had to declare war on any nation that they were fighting against because Japan never declared war on the Soviet Union and it was obvious they never would because they were busy fighting the Chinese. So why did Hitler doom Germany completely by declaring war on the U.S when it was not even necessary???
            </p>
            <p>
             It's questions like this that make you wonder how sincere Hitler actually was..Even if he was sincere, do we really want to paint such an imcompentent military leader who's incompetence eventually led to Germany's destruction as a hero? an idol to follow after? I think not.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is too much that stinks with Hitler.

            </p>
            <p>
             While all of this was underway Jews were similarly pulling the political strings in the Soviet Union to the tune of 100,000,000 dead in the Holodomor .. Jews were pulling the political strings in both countries and turned the Russian and German ppl against each other as an exercise in white genocide.

             Its not easy for some to accept this because hitler is like some hero, being one of the very few key figures who stood up against the jews - in the narrative. Take him away and what will they be left with, not just him but the way of life they lead comes into question.

                 Jews told you to say it and you complied. I can no longer fathom the mindset which would lead you to think it’s a good idea. No, it’s not fun to say. It’s a corruption of language and recontextualization to jewish thought processes.

                    if you hit someone hard enough on the head, you don't have to walk (transport) them to the gibbet to hang.

               Nothing was ever Hitlers fault, i grow tired of you Hitler apologists, you have every excuse in the world ready to exonerate him.. He was the commander in chief, he had the final say so that is why i'm saying HIS blunders because they were HIS, he was eventually the person responsible for leading Germany to a two front war they could NEVER WIN. German Armed Forces had made an oath to follow Hitlers orders and because Germans take their oaths very seriously, many did not dare to question or disobey Hitler, so fuck off with your bullshit.
              </p>
              <p>
               I guess Hitlers no retreat policy at Stalingrad was also somehow his Generals fault too?
              </p>
              <p>
               Here are some quotes from the book The Other Side Of The Hill." (1948) by B. H. Liddell Hart when Liddell Hart interviewed von Kleist;
              </p>
              <p>
               Page 112: The escape of the British Army from France has often been called "the miracle of Dunkirk". For the German armoured forces had reached the Channel coast behind the back of the British Army while this was still deep in the interior of Flanders cut off from its own bases, and from the bulk of the French Army, it seemed likely also to be cut off from the sea. Those who got away have often wondered how they managed to do so. The answer is that Hitler's intervention saved them—when nothing else could have. A sudden order from him over the telephone stopped the armoured forces just as they were in sight of Dunkirk, and held them back until the retreating British had reached the port and slipped out of their clutches.
              </p>
              <p>
               Page 112: But although the British Army thus escaped from the trap in France, it was in no state to defend England. It had left most of its weapons behind, and the stores at home were almost empty. In the following months Britain's small and scantily-armed forces faced the magnificently equipped army that had conquered France—with only a strip of water between them. Yet the invasion never came. At the time we believed that the repulse of the Luftwaffe in the "Battle over Britain" had saved her. That is only part of the explanation. The last part of it. The original cause, which goes deeper, is that Hitler did not want to conquer England. He took little interest in the invasion preparations, did nothing to spur them on, and cancelled at the first plausible excuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Page 139: On the 22nd, Boulogne was isolated by Guderian's advance, and next day Calais. That same day Reinhardt reached the Aire-St. Omer Canal, less than twenty miles from Dunkirk—the only escape port left to the British Expeditionary Force. The German armoured forces were much nearer to it than the bulk of the British Expeditionary Force. "At that moment," Rundstedt told me, "a sudden telephone call came from Colonel von Grieffenberg at O.K.H. [Oberkommando das Heeres; Army High Command], saying that Kleist's forces were to halt on the line of the canal. It was the Fuhrer's direct order—and contrary to General Halder's view. I questioned it in a message of protest, but received a curt telegram in reply, saying: 'The armoured divisions are to remain at medium artillery range from Dunkirk' (a distance of eight or nine miles). 'Permission is only granted for reconnaissance and protective movements'." Kleist said that when he got the order it seemed to make no sense to him. "I decided to ignore it, and to push on across the Canal. My armoured cars actually entered Hazebrouck, and cut across the British lines of retreat. I heard later that the British Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort, had been in Hazebrouck at the time. But then came a more emphatic order that I was to withdraw behind the canal. My tanks were kept halted there for three days." Thoma, who was chief of the tank side of the General Staff, told me that he was right up forward with the leading tanks, near Bergues, where he could look into the town of Dunkirk itself. He sent back wireless messages direct to O.K.H., begging for permission to let the tanks push on. But his appeal had no effect. Referring to Hitler's attitude, he bitingly remarked: "You can never talk to a fool. Hitler spoilt the chance of victory."

                 So far, all you've done is talk out of your ass, providing nothing of substance other than to use labels to discredit and trying to pawn of excuses as rebuttals while providing no examples and no sources. I'm the one who should say 'We're done here, you fucking kike', kike.

                 Yeah, we're definitely done here, what's the point of even talking about this subject with someone who does not even know the basics of WW2. Hitler attacked the Soviet first you fucking moron which lead to a two front war..

                 This quote is attributed to von Kleist not Liddell Hart, he was the one who documented it. Oh but i suppose that any source that shows Hitler in any bad light can not be taken seriously and has to be kike propaganda, right?

I am not here to conform to any circle jerk, I am my own person with my own thoughts and i decide to share them here, i don't expect everyone to agree with me nor is that my intention either. Not everyone you disagree with is a kike shill and not everyone who views Hitler in a very critical light is a kike shill either. Get your head out of your ass. Obviously, you are not made to have a rational discussion with.

                   You didn't discuss the quote, nor did you probably even read it, so there is no reason for you to even respond. You can look for other sources on Dunkirk and see that it was Hitlers decision to halt the advancement of the tanks. This is just one account.

                     Yes, it's an opinion, i never talked of if it as an established fact. This is one way to make sense of Hitlers blunders, so far you have not even given any explanation for his blunders other than to blame it on his Generals which shows your lack of knowledge on this subject.

ALL OF THESE THINGS COMBINES MADE IT EASIER FOR JEWS TO DESTROY GERMANY COMPLETELY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOU FUCKING MONKEY?

                        <p>
                         And this is why there is speculation that Hitler was an agent from the jews working to destroy Germany by giving the jews the means to destroy Germany completely with warfare, something they didn't achieve from WW1. Read the article i posted.

                         This is only one aspect of many other as to why Hitler legitimacy  can be put to question. Controlled opposition is a thing and have always been a thing and him being controlled opposition is within the realm of possibility and the retarded comparasion you made makes no sense in this context as this is speculation and opinions surrounding Hitlers bad blunders, something we know happened. Nothing is always as it seems on the surface and there is much that goes on behind the scenes that we may never know of, do you understand that? Probably not because you have your head far up Hitlers ass.

                         You're behaving like a cult follower of Hitler, like an adamant religious person who will react with violence and aggression when their religion gets put to criticism. Seek help.

             If Hitler really hated the Jews so much how come he never brought up their most infamous crimes of all time: ritual sacrifice, especially of children? Even the Bible is filled with these references. Why didn't Hitler bring it up?

               Are you unaware of the prevalence of Jews being accused of ritual murder of children throughout history or what? You know there are Catholic saints, martyrs, who were murdered in exactly such a way, and are so remembered. And it's all throughout the Old Testament. So again I ask: Can you show me a single time Hitler referred to this?
              </p>
              <p>
               Since you like analogies, let me give you my own analogy, retard. Jews are like cancer, and the worst behavior they are known for committing is literally murdering children. Attacking Jews for usury, or economic or political issues, but avoiding even mentioning the worst shit they do, is like something controlled opposition would do. In fact, that's not even an analogy, that's what the fuck happened.'
              </p>
              <p>
               And Hitler also made a transfer agreement with Zionists that began relocating Jews to what is now Israel. What do you think the odds are that you didn't know about that, either?
              </p>
              <p>
               Looking forward to your next pseudo-intellectual ramblings.

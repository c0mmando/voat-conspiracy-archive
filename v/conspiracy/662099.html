            Oh man, I just saw this a few days ago. I recommend listening to him while you're doing something, putting on makeup, washing the dishes, cleaning the house, chop vegetable, anything! Just don't ever sit there and watch. I'll have to admit, I would just pass out if I just watched it, staring at him for 25 minutes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really recommend giving it a second chance listening to him, he's very logical and does a lot of research. He starts of slowly, but it slowly builds up into these solid logical arguments. I recommend his rape culture video, spoiler alert you start realize the definition of rape can be so thin, from you and your wife having sex while you're both drunk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently that too can be rape. I haven't really finished the video, it's a really long one, but so far what you do slowly discover is that we are a pretty shitty culture when it comes to protecting and recognizing male rapes. Basically if there's any outrage about rape culture, it should be for men, because apparently women can only be raped and men should just deal with it.
           </p>

            Anyways! Moving onto Climate Change.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Anyone can be corrupted even to the smallest degree. Sometimes scientist will accept money just to say climate change is real.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe he starts of saying that all people can be corrupted to some degree. As much as we want some kind of cyborg like class of people who cannot be bribed by wealth and power, these people simply do not exist. Even priest, who are supposed to be pious and humble can be corrupted by power and greed. (Yes, there's a reason he starts of with this, don't worry it will build.)
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Global Cooling Scare in the 70's Motherfucking Snowpocalypse
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with that out of the way, from what I remember there's a guest on the video, some kind of famous author on climate change. During the 70's there was a whole Global Cooling scare and it was all doom and gloom and the Earth would freeze over. It would be the end of mankind, the second coming of an ice age. It clearly never happened, and now we are shouting Global Warming, I guess the climate scientist crying out Global Cooling never really apologized for their insane claims.(Stefan kind of mentions that you would think scientist, people who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of knowledgeable would be more humble and more apologetic about mistakes they have made.) I guess we should try to stop and consider perhaps, scientist can be wrong and if people can sometimes be wrong, shouldn't we not hail everything they say as the solid golden unchangeable truth?
           </p>

            <strong>
             Environmentalism the new religion
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Stefan talks about how science is the new religion so to speak. Our scientist are our modern day priest class. If you think about it, being a scientist is a pretty noble effort, you decided you want to devote your life to learning, understanding, and exploring. Doesn't this sound like a noble effort to mankind? You would think our scientist would be more humble, since they are taking such a noble cause. This is how we used to view priest, incorruptible men in the pursuit of knowledgeable The Church used to justify anything the King wanted and people did not second guess this because the Pope approves of the King. If you second guess the Church you were seen as some kind of heretic of heathen.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example Galileo was convicted of heresy because he did not believe that the solar system revolved around Earth, but we revolved around the sun. If you question any of the mainstream beliefs about climate change. You risk looking like some kind of lunatic, you might lose your teaching position, quite possibly your job.

             /v/conspiracy
            </a>
            I will point out that Crichton is dead, from throat cancer. I always wondered if it was some kind of symbolism, because he was so open about his stance on Environmentalism. You can't say he's some racist, uneducated neocon, he's Michael Crichton for fuck's sake. He wrote ER, Jurassic Park, Twister, Congo, Rising Sun. He also went to Harvard Medical School. So people can't wave the "oh he's climate denier and he's crazy card.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             TL;DR: Environmental scientist have become the new religion/priest class
            </strong>

           <p>
            <strong>
             We cannot question the church, and we should not question the King(government). Everything the King does is Holy by the Church. If you question us you should punished like Galileo for questioning the the Church

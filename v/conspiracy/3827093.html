<p>Australia’s demand for an investigation into the World Health Organization’s bungled response to the deadly Chinese coronavirus pandemic now has the backing of 62 nations.</p>
<p>Australia’s motion includes more robust language than that contained in an earlier watered down European Union version.</p>
<p>In recent weeks China has THREATENED trade penalties for Australia if it continues to defy Beijing, as Breitbart News reported. Perfect -- that shows the true colors of this hostile Asian nation.</p>

<p>It\'s only baffling if you believe the narrative of American Democrats, that the novel coronavirus came from &quot;wet markets.&quot; It\'s not baffling at all if you believe correctly that the virus came from a laboratory.

<p>It is a fact that China destroyed the lab samples, which they have now admitted to, which is in addition to other acts of DECEPTION that they have engaged in, including SILENCING whistleblowers, CENSORING terms on the internet related to the outbreak, intentionally LYING about the extent of the outbreak in their country so they could HOARD medical supplies from the world, and intentionally lying about the origin of the outbreak, falsely claiming that the U.S. military brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.</p>',

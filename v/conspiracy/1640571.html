            I used to think this theory was really goofy, but man Alex looks so old, and his life before infowars seems pretty nonexistent. It's like there never was a child Alex Jones.

            All Alex has to do to end this is show us some pictures of himself when he was in his teens and 20s. I am convinced they are the same person. Hicks was 2 years younger than me, Alex looks like a guy about my age, and he is supposed to be in his 40s. More than anything, it is the mannerisms. Plastic surgery can't change that.

            Kevin Booth listed both Jones and Hicks as the “Producer” of Booth’s 2013 film. Furthermore, Alex Jones replaced Bill Hicks as the new co-owner/star of Sacred Cow Productions. Kevin said that Bill Hicks was developing a “Rush Limbaugh type character” right before he died, and then referred to Alex Jones the “new evil Rush Limbaugh character” on Kevin Booth’s website. Alex Jones received a Bill Hicks portrait and plaque as an award (on the 10-year alleged death anniversary of Bill Hicks) before any connection between Alex and Bill Hicks was established. Alex Jones was roughly anonymous until after the purported death of Bill Hicks. Bill Hicks supposedly died in 1994; Alex Jones began making public appearances in 1996. Alex Jones and Bill Hicks both lived in and have a close connection to Austin, Texas. Alex Jones and Bill Hicks were both in standup comedy.Jones is clearly lying about his age, and eye color and he has certainly had plastic surgery. Many (e.g., Jerome Corsi, Max Keiser, Kevin Booth, Jon Ronson), including Alex Jones himself (although somewhat jokingly), have repeatedly referred to Alex Jones as Bill Hicks. Combine this fact with the fact that Kevin Booth listed both Jones and Hicks as the “Producer” of Booth’s 2013 film and it clearly appears as though Kevin Booth (their mutual good friend) believes Jones and Hicks are the same person. For example, Jones calls Kevin Booth his old friend and signs off with “I’m Bill Hicks your host, we’ll be right back.” Alex’s friends call him “Bill,” so why shouldn’t we? Both Bill Hicks and Alex Jones came from Austin Cable Access (a Time Warner affiliate). Alex Jones has strong connections with the CIA, Stratfor, mainstream media (e.g., Time Warner), and Hollywood. Despite his violent statements in public and controversial “conspiracy theorist” views, Alex Jones still somehow gets major media coverage.The circumstances surrounding Bill Hicks’s death are very questionable. For example, Bill Hicks supposedly died of pancreatic cancer, which is extremely rare at that age. Further, Bill Hicks did not seek visible treatment in a hospital (very strange for a 32-year old celebrity).The records and photos supplied by Alex Jones have patent signs of fakery. First, Alex Jones’s purported birth records include both a misspelled middle name (“Emric” should have been “Emerick”) and the wrong county of his birth. Second, Jones’s childhood photos show him with different eye colors –

             http://oi59.tinypic.com/166erd5.jpg
            </a>
            . Third, the yearbook photo supposedly shows a bend or crease in the page but which inexplicably managed not to cause any necessary distortion to the squares of any of the effected portrait boxes –
            <a href="http://mackquigley.files.wordpress.com/2">
             http://mackquigley.files.wordpress.com/2
            </a>
            …arbook.jpg. Fourth, Jones’s head is 150% larger than the other kids on the same alleged yearbook page. Kevin Booth, et al. do not exhibit the behavior that normal and reasonable persons would exhibit with respect to the claim that Alex Jones is Bill Hicks. Instead, Booth, et al. exhibit the behavior of individuals who are in on a big inside joke. Kevin Booth’s best friend and business partner, Bill Hicks, supposedly only died at the age 32 from pancreatic cancer – how funny is that? Yet, Booth (now Jones’s best friend) and others joke about it repeatedly and often repeat the claim that Jones is indeed Hicks. At one time, Booth even said that Jones was funnier than Bill Hicks. Any reasonable person in like circumstances would exhibit much more reverence and disdain on the matter. Here’s the quote from Kevin Booth: ’ What’s weird is that I think Alex is one of the funniest guys I have ever known. I mean, I think that Alex is funnier than Bill. Alex makes me laugh harder than Bill ever did. He is such a genuine character.” The Maybe Quarterly, June 26, 2003. Does this sound like the best friend of a 32-year old man that died from pancreatic cancer (very rare for a 32-year old)? When does coincidence after coincidence after coincidence officially become a conspiracy?

             I never watched Alex Jones but I know he is the gateway drug for a lot of people. I think James Corbett is the best out there. Imo. His citation of facts is impeccable really separates him from the pack. Does anyone know of any researchers similar to Corbett? Also with tens of millions of views on YouTube how has he not been invited onto Alex's show? Limited hangout?

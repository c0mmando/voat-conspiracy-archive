             as it appears in his signature resembles the EE in KEEP insofar as the first character is smaller than the next, which surely identifies him as the calligrapher, as does his method of tucking a following vowel under the crossbar of a leading capital consonant, as per "To" in TO KEEP and the "Yo" in You can't.

             The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was of seventeen Good Ol' Boys who had formed an outlaw motorcycle group in Brownsville of which GWB was a member, and is a different crime than the Children of the Fold op, unless the Onion which was the original source for the COTF incident which is known for bs was joshing, Steadman's art reflects what went on at the TCSM, so we say he was there in company with HST.

             <p>
              <strong>
               At plus eighteen hrs around 9:30 pm on the evening of November 23, 1963, Australian radio played a tape recording of the JFK assassination wherein Mrs Kennedy's voice was clearly heard calling "hello Coretta" followed by a volley of gunfire.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The presenter explained Coretta was the wife of one Reverend Martin Luther King, he played a slowed down version of the tape and asked listeners how many shots they could hear, he said he counted about nineteen his studio guest said she counted twenty two.
             </p>
             <p>
              That was the only time the Luther Kings were associated with the crime until whispers were heard at the time of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago .. although he was feted and fabulized by the same ppl who propounded the LHO lone assassin scenario there was no money the black ---- was broke.
             </p>
             <p>
              He went to the source had roped him into the conspiracy in the first place read George HW Bush, and asked for dough to be told there was none, so he chanced his arm at blackmail presumably assuring GHWB if he was not paid everyone would get to hear about what went on in Dallas .. he laughed him off.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where after some short time later on April 4, 1968 Luther King was shot dead by sniper fire while standing talking on the telephone on a hotel balcony in Memphis, we will say GHW Bush shot him for attempted blackmail.
             </p>
             <p>
              That in reprisal LK's antecedents took time out at the August 1968 DNC to drop the bombshell of his and Coretta's involvement, and that the ultra police violence blamed on

               Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
              </a>
              that marred the 1968 DNC was to smokescreen the Dallas material.

             <p>
              Haynes says Seal introduced him to a politician drug dealer from Arkansas - William Jefferson Clinton - who in 1984 asked him to kill David Kennedy, son and nephew of Senator Robert and President John Kennedy .. DK was in Florida attending a family celebration and was staying at the Brazilian Court Hotel &amp; Beach Club in Palm Beach.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was found dead there April 25, 1984, allegedly from a drug overdose after staff checked his welfare allegedly at the insistence of family members, another Kennedy brother had been staying in the same hotel and had checked out prior to the body being found .. we know most often ppl get murdered either by friends or by family members.
             </p>
             <p>
              That being said a diligent investigator would immediately assume DK's family wanted him dead for whatever reason, to which end the other brother introduced him to BJH who had accepted the contract to kill him, that it was he who had requested hotel staff to check his welfare.
             </p>
             <p>
              The same prosecutor would suppose Clinton must be the man the upper classes got in touch with if they wanted someone dead, that he could arrange it all upon payment of a suitable fee.

              Preliminary Report on the Recovery of Piper Saratoga Aircraft of John F Kennedy, Jr. The recovered aircraft shows evidence of an explosive device having been glued or affixed within the tail luggage compartment. Device was apparently actuated by a barometric trigger. Radio signals not ruled out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tail of aircraft was dismembered from the plane making it front heavy, radar shows the plane fell in excess of 6,000 feet per minute up to radar cutoff. Satellite images supplied by the National Reconnaissance Office record an outbursting flash from the aircraft just prior to it going into perpendicular descent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Recovery of luggage from beyond the flight path of the aircraft correlates with it being hurtled out of the tail luggage compartment at outburst. Preliminary examination of the aircraft shows residue of an explosive device the Laboratory identifies as being the type used by certain foreign intelligence agencies.

             It's so tiresome.  You can point out all the lies and 180's he pulls, and these blubbering boomers and honorary boomers say "but the democrats won't let him."

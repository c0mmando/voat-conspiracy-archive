            Thanks, I have been saying that all along, glad someone get's it, maybe the real liberals left on the planet will get it.

            1.) When you marry you pay a marriage tax, that means you can expect to pay +20% more in taxes when you file married.
           </p>
           <p>
            2.) Social Security is the carrot, but if they prove your married only to collect ( easy and obvious ) they hit you with fraud and fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            3.) Yes, you pay taxes, and fees, and worse you let the lawyers get your assets, marriage of gays just lets the lawyers rip off a whole new set of people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on but above are 3 obvious reason not to marry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mae West summed it up long ago, "Marriage is an institution, I have never want to go there".

             I do understand what Mike Adams, the article author, and you are saying, and to some extent I agree.  Certainly the few gay people I've known have had no difficulty recognising their own commitment to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             I gathered it was all about other stuff,  like laws of inheritance, pension sharing, and the horrible situation that comes from "I'd like to sit with my partner in the hospital ECU"  "You're not family, you can't go in there" and stuff like that.  Am I wrong?

              U lie, that's the answer to that question, when you show up at a hospital and they say "WHO R U", you lie, nobody is going to ask for "Marriage Papers", as nobody carry's them.
             </p>
             <p>
              The negatives for marriage are long, and I'm talking HET, with the GAYI don't see any positives, except perhaps in the case of a non-working spouse collecting social security from their deceased lover, but that is rare, as IMHO I find that most gay's are educated and have money, on both sides of the relationship.
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly, its always only been about social security, another element is the HIV crisis say one couple has to stay home with other, neither can work, it does happen, and in that marriage might help with disability payments, again its all about FSA stuff and main reason that GOP was fighting so hard, as SS is a limited pool, and now its years to death have just gotten shorter with additional demands by Gay survivors.
             </p>
             <p>
              In summary, yes marriage let's U in the hospital, but its only taken on your word. Now for instance if there is a vindictive family present, then I could see reasons for papers.

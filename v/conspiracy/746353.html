            Sometimes I think that all the shit that's going in the world happens for a cosmic reason and is inevitable. Maybe humanity needs to go through its share of shit every now and then in order for us to adapt and evolve.

            I don't think we'll ever come together. There are certain groups in this world that can't live in a civilized nation. There's several groups religious and racial that are dead weight dragging us down. Now there isn't much you can do about it without being called hitler v.2.

             Ha, maybe my problem is I don't "get" the higher maths (despite very much wanting to understand and study sciences). I uh, basically all the math I am good at is that which you find in video games. Percentages and decimals is as far as I go, pull out fractions? I'm out. I can do variables, that is easy, just swapping stuff around, figure out what is missing. Like a game in itself. I tried

            We're animals. What you're looking for is 'god', in whatever form that will take for you. Good luck finding it, sounds like you're really missing it.

             I'd like to be god. In a benign, "try but fail at making everybody happy." I'd settle for being King of Earth, but I don't think that will happen unless there's some sort of apocalypse, and I survive, and can deal with it.

            Along with SegFault, I call bullshit on this narrative that is being pushed. Having spent a lot of time at theintercept.com since its inception, "gang stalking" has been the primary narrative pushed on that website's comments in an attempt to derail legitimate discussion and push moderates away from a place that harbors "crazies." Another "hot word" that these personas like to use is "Zersetzung" (claims of 'touchless torture'). They like to draw off of legitimate historical parallels such as COINTELPRO, and then extrapolate those ideas and claim that they apply to endless individuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my opinion, the operation is attempting to lead people to believe that ANY sort of action against the political mainstream will result in harassment, regardless of any other circumstance. The goal is to have people shut down towards taking any direct action out of fear for the repurcussions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously this claim cannot be proven, but read into NSA/GCHQ techniques of discrediting websites and their users, "gang stalking" fits perfectly:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't give this too much of a platform by continuing, but here is a thread on The Intercept where you can see this narrative raging in the comments:

           </p>
           <p>
            Users such as "Torturestan," "stalked562," "Ricardo Camilo López" "Christian C Holmer" "Pat. B" and "WakeUpAmerica" have been on that website peddling their shit countless times.

             I never heard of it but I know that scientologists will use a tactics like those described here against those that speak out against them.  Like, they'll kill your dog in your yard one day while you're at work - no one's home to see them do it &amp;c.

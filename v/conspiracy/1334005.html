            I'll check into that. That's my only speak video. All the rest are not speech necessary, but thanks for your comment I'll try to make it sound clearer next time. I said "almost 2,000 people were arrested as possible conspirators. Booth was going to have to make his escape from a theater full of people, many armed. The president is allegedly under armed guard.General Ulysses S. Grant, has vanished just hours before he was to have accompanied the Lincolns to the theater. Parker will desert his post. And other key armed personnel in Ford’s Theater. somehow booth managed to make his way out of the theater, then he will have to make his way out of the city and across the Potomac. armed soldiers, armed spies and armed police, as well as armed citizens everywhere. defending himself with a dagger.
Navy Yard Bridge is where booth had to reach. the bridge has a strict curfew and the armed guard is under standing orders not to allow anyone to cross without explicit authorization. If you attempt to cross without anyway, you will be shot. booth must first get to the president, who is sitting in a private box in a crowded theater with at least two armed attendants. kill the president with a single shot, make an escape first from the theater and then from the city, and get past an armed guard at the bridge. with just one bullet.
John Wilkes Booth used a single shot derringer. Why? It is an unbelievably inaccurate gun. A revolver has 5 or 6 shots it makes no sense. Revolvers are easy to come by. Booth assassinates the president. In a crowded theater. In the middle of Washington, heavily fortified and militarized. Lewis Paines goal is to kill Lincoln’s Secretary of State.
there are readily accessible weapons in the home. And, armed patrols all over the city, In the home are: William Seward, William Bell, Seward’s black servant Frederick Seward, William’s son Major Augustus Seward, another son and a career Army officer . Private George Robinson, Seward’s personal attendant Emerick Hansell, a US State Department courier. Frances Seward, the secretary’s wife. Fanny Seward, his daughter and, the wife of one of the Seward sons. Lewis Paine allegedly gravely wounded six people in hand-to-hand combat, and yet, as photos taken soon after his arrest just days later reveal, he didn’t have so much as a scratch on him. why would he leave his weapon behind? He also allegedly left a bloodstained coat with gloves and a fake moustache in the pocket in the woods just outside of DC. the first three people to conveniently arrive at the crime scene Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, and Surgeon General Joseph Barnes. None of them reported seeing Augustus there.
Augustus was later presented at trial as both a victim of and an eyewitness to the attack but no one witnessed him there."No attorneys were provided for the defendants. they had to retain their own counsel, despite being completely cut off from the outside world. Consequently, some of them began the proceedings with no representation. Even after obtaining counsel, they were not allowed to have any private consultations with their attorneys. And they were not allowed to testify or speak in court at all, nor could any statements made by them be introduced."
there was no such thing as the “United” States. There were Northern states presided over by Washington, and there were Confederate states presided over by Richmond.
Lincoln was most certainly not a beloved man. He was thoroughly despised in the south, and wasn’t popular in the north. He received merely 40% of the popular vote in 1860. But Lincoln was clearly the anointed one. “the most gentle, most magnanimous, most Christ-like ruler of all time.” Nine people faced trial as co-conspirators, eight by military tribunal Mary Surrat, David Herold, George Atzerodt, Dr. Samuel Mudd, Samuel Arnold, Michael O’Laughlen, Edward Spangler, and Lewis Paine and(John Surrat). Four were executed, three received life sentences, one was given a six-year prison term, and one was acquitted. As for Booth, he was captured and gunned down at Garrett’s barn on April 26, 1865 and so never made it to trial. so very conveinent.

              If you're worried about that then you could just run a filter. Or at least have it set so you can make out what the hell you're suppose to be saying. It's a shame to have wasted the time to have edited this together if no ones going to watch it due to just being unable to understand what the hell you're saying.

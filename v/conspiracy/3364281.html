When you google BitChute, <strong><em>her name</em></strong> was the first name to appear <em>(only minutes ago)</em>.....but then either Google or BitChute changed it. Well, we\'re hearing more about <strong>(((BitChute)))</strong>, which is <em>(theoretically)</em> controlled by a man calling himself <em>&quot;Ray Vahey&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the incorporation documents for BitChute state the name, <strong>&quot;(((Raymond Noel Vahey)))&quot;</strong>....not &quot;Ray Vahey&quot;. </p>
<p>And the first five letters of Bitchute are...<strong>B-I-T-C-H</strong>. That doesn\'t seem like a family-friendly name, does it?</p>
<p><strong>(((_Bitchute_)))</strong> is supposed to be a <em>&quot;censorship avoidance&quot;</em> site, right? From both <em>Google</em> and <em>Wikipedia</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BitChute is a video hosting service that uses peer-to-peer WebTorrent technology. <strong>It was founded as a way to avoid content rules that are enforced on platforms like YouTube</strong>, and some creators who have been banned or had their channels &quot;demonetized&quot; on YouTube have migrated to BitChute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, BitChute is based in the UK <em>(near London)</em>....which has <strong><em>no free speech laws whatsoever</em></strong>. Why would anyone base an Internet site opposed to censorship, in the Orwellian UK <em>(of all places)</em>? Does that make any sense?</p>
<p><em>&quot;Noel&quot;</em> could be perceived as a <strong><em>JEWISH</em></strong> name. </p>
<p><strong>English Name:</strong> Noel</p>
<p><strong>Hebrew Name:</strong> נואל</p>
<p>From Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name is derived from \'noël\', the French word for Christmas, and ultimately of the Latin \'natalis\' and \'natale domini\'. The name was traditionally given to babies born during the Christmas season. In addition, Noel is a variant of the name Noah (English, German, <strong>Hebrew</strong>, and Slavic) in the Spanish language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you switch the letters of his last name around <em>(Vahey)</em>, it\'s spelled <strong><em>&quot;Yahve&quot;</em></strong>. If you look up <em>Yahve&quot;</em> on Google, you get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>n a name for the God of the Old Testament as transliterated from the <strong>Hebrew</strong> consonants YHVH. Synonyms: JHVH, Jahvey, Jahweh, Jehovah, Wahvey, YHVH, YHWH, Yahveh, Yahwe, Yahweh Example of: God, Supreme Being.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I\'ll let others here research the name, <strong><em>&quot;Yahve&quot;</em></strong>, on their own.....as it feels like <em>word games</em> are being played here.</p>
<p>The <em>&quot;C&quot;</em> in <em>&quot;BitChute&quot;</em> looks a bit like a <strong><em>masonic compass</em></strong>. What is the connection between <strong>Freemasonry</strong> and <strong>Luciferianism?</strong> I\'ll let you goats do your own research on that.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you look up the name, <em>&quot;Raymond Noel Vahey&quot;</em>....you can\'t find much. He used to work for <strong>Thumbtel</strong>, and had something to do with their <strong>&quot;Hullo&quot; app</strong>....while under the name <em>&quot;Ray Vahey&quot;</em>. Beyond that, the man is mostly a ghost. You can find a few other things, but he really doesn\'t have much of a digital footprint, beyond very recent stuff.....which is strange, for someone who presumably created a site like BitChute. </p>
<p>He lives in Thailand with his Thai wife. There are only a couple of YouTube interview videos of Vahey that show his face in motion. He <em>(strangely)</em> does not reveal his face in multiple online video interviews. His personality on camera <em>(when he finally does appear)</em> seems passive, emotionally detached, robotic, and slightly weird.</p>
<p><em>BitChute</em> has been pushed a lot lately as an alternative to <em>YouTube</em>, hasn\'t it?</p>
<p>Is BitChute also a <strong><em>Zionist</em></strong> platform? Is this site controlled opposition for YouTube? BitChute uses <strong><em>(((Disqus)))</em></strong> for making comments. Disqus <em>dropped</em> Roosh V\'s <strong>&quot;Return of Kings&quot;</strong> site, when the posters were too deeply discussing the <strong><em>false flag events</em></strong> of <em>Charlottesville</em>. Well, who owns Disqus? </p>
<p><strong><em>Disqus is owned by Zeta Global.</em></strong> And <em>who</em> owns <strong>Zeta Global?</strong> From Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zeta Global was founded by <strong>David A. Steinberg</strong> and John Sculley in 2007 under the name \'XL Marketing\'. The company changed its name to \'Zeta Interactive\' in 2014, then again to \'Zeta Global\' in October 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <strong>prnewswire:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-global-acquires-disqus-300566451.html">https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zeta-global-acquires-disqus-300566451.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW YORK, Dec. 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --</strong> Zeta Global today announced it has <strong>acquired Disqus</strong>, the web\'s leading audience engagement platform used by 4 million websites and 2 billion monthly unique users. Combined with Zeta\'s leading marketing platform, <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and machine learning, the acquisition makes Zeta the only company able to offer personalized real-time marketing at scale on the open web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, isn\'t it?</p>
<p>A corporation that effectively <strong><em>controls comment software</em></strong> for websites is working on <strong><em>artificial intelligence?</em></strong> I wonder how that should be interpreted.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> For more hilarity, look at a <strong>(((Disqus)))</strong> account under the name of <strong><em>hoaxashian</em></strong>, who seems to be no fan of &quot;Ray Vahey&quot; and expresses rage about Internet <em>&quot;Zionist trolls&quot;</em>. Here\'s one of his videos that <em>(unintentionally)</em> has certain implications about both Disqus and BitChute, since <strong><em>BitChute uses Disqus for making comments.</em></strong> The guy who owns the channel is boring, but the conflict he\'s experiencing is interesting....and strangely illuminating.</p>

           ....not "Ray Vahey".

           site, right? From both

           Interesting, isn't it?
          </p>
          <p>
           A corporation that effectively
           <strong>
            <em>
             controls comment software
            </em>
           </strong>
           for websites is working on
           <strong>
            <em>
             artificial intelligence?
            </em>
           </strong>
           I wonder how that should be interpreted.

           <strong>
            P.S.
           </strong>
           For more hilarity, look at a
           <strong>
            (((Disqus)))
           </strong>
           account under the name of
           <strong>
            <em>
             hoaxashian
            </em>
           </strong>
           , who seems to be no fan of "Ray Vahey" and expresses rage about Internet
           <em>
            "Zionist trolls"
           </em>
           . Here's one of his videos that
           <em>
            (unintentionally)
           </em>
           has certain implications about both Disqus and BitChute, since
           <strong>
            <em>
             BitChute uses Disqus for making comments.
            </em>
           </strong>
           The guy who owns the channel is boring, but the conflict he's experiencing is interesting....and strangely illuminating.

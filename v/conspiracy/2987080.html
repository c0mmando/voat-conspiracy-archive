            The CIA describes the planning for this Operation Cuckoo murder of former agent Mary Meyer Pinchot. Operation Cuckoo murder teams under Operation Cleansweep were involved in JFK "Big Event" witness eradications. Operation Guillotine is likely code for the JFK assassination, and Operation Siren is likely code for Mary's intimate and personal espionage on JFK. Operation Mockingbird is of course Intelligence agent infiltration of the Media.

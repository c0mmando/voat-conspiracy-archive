             If they killed him then it's not them looking for him. But if he's alive, then it gives them motive to constantly stir the pot making people search for him, because that makes it harder to hide, harder to move, and contributes stress related illnesses. It also makes people question whether WikiLeaks has been compromised, slowing the rate of leaks. If governments wanted you dead, would you be comfortable providing the world with a proof of life every other day? There really needs to be a better way for people to verify whether WikiLeaks has been compromised. Him being the figurehead of the organization may be keeping him alive, and it may be putting his life at risk, but in either case or even if both or neither are true, he is in a position of tremendous prolonged stress and he's not immortal.

            If assange was allowed to leave the embacy at all, I assume he would have needed state-level help getting out of the UK. Which is quite possible I guess. I also assume that state-level actor would likely be allied with Ecuador.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the above said, assange would have the resources to communicate secretly with that party. A
           </p>
           <p>
            All that leads me to think that you need not worry about any schemes designed to draw him out of hiding, but thats just my two cents.

             I dunno, I hear people are pretty good at smuggling people wherever they please. Getting him out of the embassy undetected seems like the riskiest part to me. After that, I'm sure it can't be all that hard for an organization to smuggle somebody. I mean, you could run through your plan as many times as you'd like with some dummy object at no risk whatsoever to see how well the plan would work. But it's hard to practice any plans at the embassy itself because there's such a higher probability of somebody watching and paying attention.

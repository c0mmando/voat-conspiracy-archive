            Well at least you mentioned the skateboard, many news outlets are completely omitting that bit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been watching this develop as it struck a little too close to home. A lot of the details are not yet available, so a concrete assesment at this point is not possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the guy did in fact assault the officer with his skateboard, it would seem that a cop would have several options to utilize before firing 12 rounds. A night stick, pepper spray or a tazer are all standard equipment for OPD. Furthermore, this particular officer has served as an MP, so reason leads me to believe he's had a fair bit of hand to hand combat training.
           </p>
           <p>
            The officer in question has since been suspended or fired from the force. (sorry, I don't recall which)
           </p>
           <p>
            A protest and demonstration took my place in downtown Olympia the other day, which while large in attendance, did very little to promote the cause they were going for. A later smaller protest that night lead by some shit starters went much more poorly.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think one thing we can all agree on, is that assaulting an officer is a poor and risky decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally hope that this situation gets resolved quickly and changes to into effect that limit or prevent a repeat of this. Hopefully this will allow a body camera bill to be pushed through for the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I wish cops would stop shooting people. But at the same time, I wish that they would, you know.... Shoot people. 12 shots fired with only 2 hits? 1/6 ratio is deplorable for anyone not using a rapid firing assault weapon.

             Skateboard to the head can kill a person.  Skateboards have metal on the underside with a bolt sticking out.  If that bolt connects with a persons head it can kill them.
            </p>
            <p>
             They both had skateboards and they both were stealing.  I watched the video.  Solution to this problems seems clear to me.  Don't steal.  And don't swing skateboards at cops.  They could have dropped the skateboards and turned themselves in but I'm guessing they choose to thug it out.
            </p>
            <p>
             edit: they shouldn't have tried to steal, what looks to be, beer.  Get job, get money, then go to the store and buy things.

<p>But the fact that the helicopter was part of the Presidential \'White Top\' fleet and the crewmen may have perished in a most unusual way.</p>
<p>The first person on the scene was Frank C. Owens, a civilian who saw the wreckage while driving home from an archaeological dig. He immediately rushed to the site to render aid to any survivors. </p>
<p>&quot;I couldn\'t believe what I saw,&quot; said Owens. &quot;Those men were burned and there was almost no bleeding from their wounds.&quot; Owens went on to describe the grizzly sight in the mangled wreckage. </p>
<p>&quot;What got me was there was fuel everywhere but no evidence of a fire. Their uniforms weren\'t even burned. But the men sure were.&quot; What Owens saw in the woods that day ultimately launched him on his own investigation to find out what really happened.</p>

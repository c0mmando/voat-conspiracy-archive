            I agree he is most likely a hoax or some kind of 'crisis actor.' As another poster explained, if he was a real ALS victim then he would be dead by now. All he does is spout masonic propaganda about black holes, the Big Bang and aliens. In addition, Cambridge University is well-known for its MI5 and MI6 connections.

            Except he has actually written papers about the Entropy of black holes. He's a real scientist. This theory is just cynical speculation.

             Your assuming the man called Stephen Hawking wrote the books attributed to him is speculation on your part. Not only could they be forgeries, but they have drawn much criticism from other scientists which is obviously suppressed. He is a mathematician posing as a physicist so his work on black holes could be called speculation as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I thought of this "theory" it was me just speculating for fun but now I am 90% convinced of it. There's plenty of other people who think it's true and have written about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you think the man called Stephen Hawking is really who he says he is you have to believe that he has outlived the 2nd place record holder for living with ALS by over 30 years - outliving the disease now by over 50 years - and gotten younger while doing so. Keep in mind on average people live for 4 years with ALS.

              True. I'll admit, I just kind of dismissed you off-hand. I'm still not convinced though. This theory would also mean that Leonard Susskind and other scientists have to be in on it. The only time I'd consider a conspiracy that elaborate is if it involved the CIA covering up something big, not some people trying to  make money off book deals.

              In b4 Hawkings is a CIA agent.

             I haven't read it yet, but there is a pretty good sized article/essay about this. I am starting to think he is a double since I can see obvious differences in their appearances.

              of course we're going to need more than those few pictures listed there... to make it stick, if at all.

               Mathis says in that paper that most pictures of Hawking aren't dated, so that makes it more difficult to find comparisons. The fact that he looks younger in 2007 than he did in the 90s is pretty convincing, as well as that he got pneumonia in 1985 and doctors wanted to take him off life support. Seems like he long since should have been deader than a doornail.

            Well, I honestly thought of this myself, sort of just joking around with my girlfriend who was rolling her eyes, and didn't do any research about it before I posted this this morning, but

            brought it to my attention that it was already a theory. So I just Googled "Stephen Hawking hoax" and sure enough there are plenty of results. The idea is that he's just some vegetative invalid that other perpetrators are speaking through.

            There is a theory that Hawking died sometime around the 80's and they replaced him with an impostor. Hawking has Parkinson disease and he holds the record for living with the disease the longest.  He has outlived the guy in the number two spot by about 20 years.  Why would they do this?  For all the reasons you just talked about.

            I don't remember where i saw this first, I think it was a YouTube video.  Like a lot of things in this sphere it could be total bullshit but maybe not.  Check it out for yourself if you like.

             Wow that's amazing. I was about to bring up the idea of him being replaced because that could explain how he wrote all the books and at least at some point was a legitimate scientist.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will check it out. Didn't know it was already a theory, I just was watching television the other day and he was in a car commercial and was I was just bullshitting around and said to my girlfriend what if he is a hoax?

<p>Testamentum Johannis Dee Philosophi Summi

<p>This Letter third and last I minde to make,
At your request for very vertues sake;
Your written panges, and methods set aside,
From that I byd, looke that you never slide.
Cut that in Three, which Nature hath made One,
Then strengthen hyt, even by it self alone,
Wherewith then Cutte the poudred Sonne in twayne,
By length of tyme, and heale the woonde againe.
The self same Sunne twys yet more, ye must wounde,
Still with new Knives, of the same kinde, and grounde;
Our Monas trewe thus use by natures Law,
Both binde and lewse, only with rype and rawe,
And ay thanke God who only is our Guyde,
All is ynugh, no more then at this Tyde.</p>

<p>Rosicrucianism </p>
<p>The Rosicrucian Manifestos heralded a &quot;universal reformation of mankind&quot;, through a science allegedly kept secret for decades until the intellectual climate might receive it. Controversies have arisen on whether they were a hoax, whether the &quot;order of the Rosy Cross&quot; existed as described in the manifestos, or whether the whole thing was a metaphor disguising a movement that really existed, but in a different form. In 1616, Johann Valentin Andreae famously designated it as a &quot;ludibrium&quot;.</p>
<p>The peak of the &quot;Rosicrucianism furore&quot; was reached when two mysterious posters appeared on the walls of Paris in 1622 within a few days of each other. The first said &quot;We, the Deputies of the Higher College of the Rose­Croix, do make our stay, visibly and invisibly, in this city (...)&quot;, and the second ended with the words &quot;The thoughts attached to the real desire of the seeker will lead us to him and him to us.&quot;[10]</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians is believed by those best informed to have been built up gradually, carefully, and slowly, by the old occult masters and adepts, from the scattered fragments of the esoteric teachings which were treasured by the wise men of all races. The legend runs that these fragments of the Secret Doctrine were the scattered portions of the old esoteric teaching of ancient Atlantis— the bits of the great mass of the Atlantean occult teachings which were scattered in all directions by the great cataclysm which had destroyed that great continent. The few survivors of the Atlantean civilization carefully preserved these Fragments of Truth, and passed them on to their chosen students and capable descendants.</p>

            What I don't get is how all our lives we're told that you can't trust two types of people: politicians and lawyers. Hilary's both! And here we are with everything is what it usually isn't, and no one seems to get it! And a businessman at that!

            You need an antagonist to have a protagonist. How else to get everyone's approval strong behind a president at a time when no one trusts politicians anymore? Bring in a guy who seems to be the underdog, not of the system, not part of the politicians, who seems to have an agenda that opposes prior misdeeds. They wanted Hillary to be the worst candidate in history; the entire time everything happened I was thinking why in the world would they allow all these things to come out about her and still push her campaign? There were times it was outrageously bad. Unbelievably bad. And it continued. Why?
To get the American's approval behind who they really want in the office.

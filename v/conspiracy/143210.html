            Sir , respectfully you are confused about the information, let me try to help:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Yes "Free Will" is the mathematical rule of this "plane set" so all these universes and what could be considered the "2nd Plane"  to understand this you would have to read this : (unlikely you will)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            <a href="https://kolinevans.wordpress.com/about/">
             https://kolinevans.wordpress.com/about/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            but i post here for other to learn also.
           </p>
           <p>
            however that does not mean that people can't contravene free will,  it happens all the time, it just means that the person that mathematically contravenes free will, shifts towards a different plane set. 
so their act
            <strong>
             IS
            </strong>
            ( have a think about it) an act of free will.
understand?
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Re "power structures of earth" you are either confused or misinformed but that's fine we can continue along our own paths, the probability equation that you understand this just by talking to me is low, so i won't expend energy on it.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              nope i acknowledged just that, i acknowledged that the Corporation that we call a "government" did have an arrangement, they no longer do , so if abduction occur (without consent) they are "illegal" you can report them here RIGHT here they will be seen by the group , but without a image of the race involved it would be difficult to  trace.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I know a whole lot of information, i don't claim to know all , and never did my information comes from a spectrum of sources and can be verified. i think you misunderstand (but that is understandable)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            actually if you want to troll though "Fox" post you can see where i corrected his information for him where he might have been "confused or misunderstood"
           </p>
           <p>
            so I'm here to help friend.

            I prefer you post on my Sub then i can keep track of who has ask me what - but i will answer here :
           </p>
           <p>
            1.
 No idea what the "Grail stone" is i don't have full access to the database, Tan can ask but I'm sure it's some old relic that has a lot of importance to humans and not much to the galaxy , but please expand if it is important i will ask.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            2.
Some are not so much "negative" as don't see us as an thing more than a DNA container, some of these races are themselves considered "Pests" they don't really think about what they do they just do it, they don't see "free will" in the same way as you and I.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they were doing this is was illegal technically however in the USA (corp) did make an agreement to trade "technology" for "study and DNA"
           </p>
           <p>
            Nazis contacted a homonoid race and told them earth was under attack by a Reptilian race, the Nazis basically lied, when the other race bothered to come here they saw the truth and withdrew all assistance as per protocol, they witnessed the USA nuke Japan and saw how aggressive that was and were disgusted by it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same race occupy a base in Antarctica, the USA then confused this as a Nazi base and attacked it with obvious results, this is why there are never weapons on Antarctica.

That is almost all incorrect or confused.
Everything works on "free will" if you give your power away someone will take it, if you participate in the monetary system then to a degree you give up some rights.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humans were created as a result of a very very old war between homonoids and Reptilians, other races are leery and wary of humans, because we were a very effective fighting container.
           </p>
           <p>
            the biggest thing we did (in my opinion) to prove we could/should not be integrated was nuke Japan.
           </p>
           <p>
            humans  humorously have a "oh poor me" attitude but other races see 7 billion potential "fighting machines" add "Antigrav" and basic energy weapons and they see that as a potential problem. (although it is not)
           </p>

            4.
a human word for "Jesus"? who was possibly just a representative from a different colony, but people though he was son of "God" when the most likely thing he was was a representative of our "creator" the race that created the human container.
humanity's real father.

            Let me clarify your confusion.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              I am to a degree a member of the "group of galaxies" disinfo has you guys chasing your tail but this is a reality 100% you will just see it is, it is only a matter of a small amount of time.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              if I seem a little "urgent" thats because there is a lot happening right now, dont get me wrong most of it I find kind of humorous (not in a disrespectful way but In an observational way)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I would ask you to sit down grab a peice of paper and try to write out all the things you "know" and "dont know" it will be hard but I can help you.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I can't (its very hard) be "tricked",  because I am in contact with multiple races in the group , yes some are "less friendly" than other to what you think is the "ideal human condition" but everything is opinion.

            I can repy no problem,  but I will say more in a few days.
           </p>
           <p>
            I use to be just like some of these people,  I thought the "alien" angle was just to confuse or distract people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I met them face to face.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I had a crash course in learning. (After a short adjustment period)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now let me simply explain the flaw in human thinking:
           </p>
           <p>
            We always just tend to think in polarized fields for example:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             the scenario will be a government fake invasion
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Or
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             we are being tricked by evil ETs
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            problem is in the set of scenarios everything ia possible.
Think about the wider galaxy and universe as just a bigger version of the same sort of politics going on right here.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             You will note I said some things did  ot add up with what Fox had been told
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             it was ME that called them out on this immediately
            </strong>
           </p>

            That friend is why im asking for a reply.

           <p>
            "Government" does work with some other races but in a very limited way and anyhow what is government it's a face for some corporations, so some know nothing,  MJ12 like to think they know as much as I do, and the NSA blocks info.

             Come and post your account on contact that is why I made the sub, anything including what you might think are "dreams"
It will be a shock perhaps to know humans don't really "dream" well not how one might think.
Alternatively you can pm me, but honestly why try to keep privacy?
             <br/>
             Also there are 100s of craft and many races in our atmosphere right now, so if you can describe we might be able to help.

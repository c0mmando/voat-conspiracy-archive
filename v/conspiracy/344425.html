             Almost overnight, measles went from being characterized as a natural rite of passage necessary for strengthening immunity to a deadly infection against which we have only one hope against complete destruction: 100% vaccine uptake. The truth is that measles and other childhood infections may actually protect against life-threatening conditions like cancer and heart disease.

              Must I do your research for you?  If I did, would you even be open-minded?  Let's find out.
             </p>
             <p>
              First, you cannot get just a measles vaccine, you can only get an MMR vaccine, which is owned solely by Merck.  Did you know that? [

              ]
             </p>
             <p>
              Second, let's go into the other parts of the MMR vaccine.. let's start with mumps and the revelation of two whistleblowers from inside Merck taken from this Forbes article:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Anyone who falls on either side of the debate about vaccines’ alleged potential to cause harm is sure to have heard the big news this week — the unsealing of a whistleblower suit against Merck, filed back in 2010 by two former employees accusing the drugmaker of overstating the effectiveness of its mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine.
              </p>
              <p>
               The scientists claim Merck defrauded the U.S. government by causing it to purchase an estimated four million doses of mislabeled and misbranded MMR vaccine per year for at least a decade, and
               <strong>
                helped ignite two recent mumps outbreaks that the allegedly ineffective vaccine was intended to prevent in the first place
               </strong>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               “
               <strong>
                As the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is by far the largest financial victim of Merck’s fraud. But the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection against mumps. And while this is a disease the CDC targeted to eradicate by now, the failure in Merck’s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger with significant outbreaks continuing to occur
               </strong>
               ,” the suit alleges.

               It refers to a 2006 mumps outbreak in the Midwest, in which 6,500 cases were reported among a highly vaccinated population, and another in 2009, in which 5,000 cases were confirmed. By comparison, the annual average of mumps cases in the U.S. in the two decades preceding the 2006 outbreak was 265; before the introduction of the single-shot Mumpsvax vaccine in 1967, there were approximately 200,000 cases of the disease, according to the 55-page document.

               Burden of proof lies with the one making the claim. Otherwise you could say something ridiculous and tell others to prove you wrong. That's not how that works.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I have done research on this. Specifically the measles, ebola, hiv, and the Bas-Congo virus in my undergrad where I was credited in 2 publications. My bachelor's degree is in microbiology with emphasis in virology, immunology, and human biology. I'm almost done with my Masters degree in Physician Assistant Studies. So when I say that I am very informed in vaccines I at least have the credentials to back up that claim.
              </p>
              <p>
               I asked for sources and you provided an article written on askdrsears.com and forbes.com, neither of which are credible or provided sources for all their claims. There was one scientific study you did provide that didn't talk about the effectiveness of vaccines but rather how diseases were on the decline prior to those vaccines.
              </p>
              <p>
               To answer your question if I would be open minded, I am very open minded when it comes to claims with proof. Am I open minded to asinine commentary on what someone hopes to be true despite mountains of research contradicting them? No, because I'm not stupid. However I realize that you obviously refuse to listen to reason (in the literal sense of the word) even with actual science showing the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Quit your BS. It's your movement that is bringing back diseases that were almost EXTINCT in America.

                The scientific establishment is bought and paid for by big pharma.  As Dr Peter Gøtzsche explains, the medical establishment kills millions a year and many universities and labs are compromised (see: bought the fuck out to produce the desired results by their money-handlers):

                All your science (if you were to link any) would be completely rigged.  There are wash out periods prior to studies where they get rid of people who have adverse immediate reactions or would (knowingly by the scientists) in the end have a bad reaction to fudge up their desired/paid-for results.  There are no studies that test the combination of many of the adjuvants all together (mercury [still in flu shots], aluminium etc].  Also there are many benefits of getting some of these virus (as stated with measles) and developing a life-long immunity (unlike vaccines which require a booster).  Some people might still believe in partial vaccination, but not the current schedule at the moment either.  There is a doctor in Washington who vaccinations after age three and out of all his clients, none of them have autism (although he should have a 1:150 expected rate of diagnosis).  My two year-old has had none, and been 100% healthy.  Extremely intelligent and physically adept.

                There is not one study proving that any vaccine is safe and effective for ANY given person.  We are all different people, with different diets and immune systems.  The hubris and arrogance of the scientific to knowingly continue the vaccine crusade with the aforementioned data (that some vaccines will maim, alter or murder a small percentage of those who take it).  It's right on the back of the fuckin' box.  I feel the onus should be on a person's diet - there should be mandatory healthy-food act instead of mandatory vaccines if anything (which I still wouldn't want/agree with).  People eat food-like substances and drink alcohol/caffeine (as well as many other activities, or lack there of; see exercise) etc which all lower the immune system (or create a poor one).  They are just using a 'temporary fix' (vaccines) for a the symptom (getting sick) of a greater disease (shit immune systems).

<p>I\'m going to postulate first what I believe.  I believe that the NSA, while it does spy on everyone, actually uses the spying in order to help out our financial interests more than anything else.  The United States controls the banking industry, and more importantly, we control the currency (US dollars).  Everyone exchanges on the US dollar.... or did.  Our government is deeply tied with banking interests, which is why they are considered too big to fail <em>and</em> too big to jail, even when demonstrably shown to be in a criminal conspiracy to steal billions of dollars.  It\'s important for the wealthy here in America that the banking and Wall Street stay under complete control, as that is a good chunk of where our entire GDP comes from (I wasn\'t sure which figure was the most reliable on that one, admittedly.  I found several articles postulating that it was between 40-60%, some even going as high as 90% which even going with 40 as the low is an extremely large portion). With the introduction of the AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank), we\'re going to see something new.  A banking industry that has a good chunk of the world trading, banking, and aligning with will make dramatic changes to the US.  ISIS is now switching to their own currency system as they systematically move and spread across the Middle East.  Greece is stating they are going to be unable to pay back the IMF, and this will likely harm the entire banking sector in all of Europe.</p>
<p>To me, there\'s a pattern emerging there.  Our US controlled global banks are no longer going to be what\'s used in Asian countries thanks to China, they\'re not going to be used in the Middle East thanks to ISIS, and we\'ve already implemented so many sanctions against Russia that they\'re not really going to use us.  Sure, that leaves Africa, although I\'d hardly call most African countries strong US allies/supporters, I suspect that many will go with China\'s AIIB in the near future.  That leaves Europe, with a host of their own problems and the Euro in serious trouble right now.  
</p>
<p>This, to me, has seemed to all occur in an extremely short time-frame.  While I don\'t know if there was a conspiracy there to unseat the American hegemony throne, I suspect the collapse of the American dollar is truly on the horizon.  Americans in general are extremely disillusioned with America, we feel the policies don\'t represent the people, that the politicians are controlled by short-sighted lobbyists intent on furthering their own ends at the expense of us, and we don\'t even believe we\'re the good guys any more.  We don\'t support our military as much, we feel like we\'re living in a police state, and many of us feel like unless you were born with a silver spoon already in your mouth--there\'s no hope for getting to the top yourself.  The American dream has truly ended and we\'ve reverted back to a class system.</p>
<p>I can see these patterns emerging, but I can\'t even begin to guess what\'s next.  The American people are too fat and lazy to start a revolution, and because of that they\'re also going to be too fat and lazy to adequately support America from an external threat that is on the horizon.  I really, really suspect that the end of America is coming within the next 20 years, more likely to end in the next 5-10.</p>
<p>Now that I\'ve given what I believe, now onwards to the thought experiment itself.  What will happen when America\'s gone?</p>',

            Honestly, I think we'll be just fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            America isn't going anywhere. It might not be as dominant in the world as it used to be, but so what?
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The US military is still the strongest in the world. Really - nobody comes close. US security against foreign armies will be unaffected.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The US economy is still the strongest in the world. Maybe it won't be forever, but again - so what? Being the second (or seventh) largest economy in the world is still very good.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There will be
              <strong>
               massive
              </strong>
              changes in the US political system. It might take a revolution or mass civil unrest, but change will come. But in the end, there will still be a US government that works
              <strong>
               for the people
              </strong>
              . At least at the beginning.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The US will stop projecting its power globally as much as they used to. There will still be major US bases around the world (Poland, Kuwait, etc.), but expect a significant draw back. Both good and bad come with this one. Bad: the bad parts of the world will get worse. Rwanda, Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syrua, etc. Without US troops to slow them down, ISIS and Al-Qaeda will spread faster and grow stronger. Good: new global players will step up to the plate. Expect India, China, Brazil, Australia, and a few others to do more in the way of foreign intervention in conflicts such as Darfur.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              There will be a big flare-up in the Middle East. Various factions that were playing nice to placate the Americans might stop doing so. The Saudis and Turks will probably do some (more) ethnic cleansing. There will most likely be another big confrontation between Israel/Hamas/Hezbollah, but it will end just like all the others have in the past.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Iran will get nukes. Followed by Saudi Arabia. Probably followed by Egypt and Venezuela. Hopefully by then, Israel's Iron Dome and Iron Beam technologies have matured to take down nukes and have been shared with the rest of the world - hopefully rendering all missile technology obsolete.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            So in conclusion... Either we'll be fine, or we'll blow ourselves up.

            I think they are pushing for another large world war which will completely cripple most countries that are already having a hard time financially. If you look at the Albert pike letter which was written in 1871, he wrote precisely about world war 1 and 2 and this was some 40 years before it even happened. Furthermore he goes on to mention a third world war in the middle east which will drag everyone into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's pretty much what I believe will happen. ISIS have already been placed in the middle east terrorising countries and causing dissent amongst them so they have made a good start with them. Iran is a huge pain in the ass for Israel, Israel want to split up the other surrounding countries and make them more manageable so they can dominate the area but Iran is a major problem for them. America keeps going on about the threat of Iran and threatening to take action if they progress with any nuclear project, meanwhile Russia and china have stated in the past that they will back Iran.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears that TPTB have been trying to pull in more and more countries, with the Canadian parliment incident, the charlie hebdo attack in France, and the Tunisia attacks as well as others. Eventually it is all going to kick off in the middle east and I think it will involve may countries in a large scale world war, and this is what I believe jade helm is all about. When Obama says it's training for overseas deployment I fully believe that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Albert pike also says in that letter that the moslem arabic world and the state of Israel will mutually destroy each other, so we could be looking at the destruction of zionist Israel in the near future. My gut feeling is that the safest place to be in the next 10-15 years is anywhere but the middle east.

            China has been vendor financing America's shit.  China would be dealing with the unrest of 1 billion people if they didn't perform pointless make-work.

           <p>
            Second, the Federal Reserve is the biggest owner of U.S. debt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, China pegs its currency to the dollar.  They have to buy treasuries to maintain the peg.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, China is fucked.  When a country owes you $trillions, that is a you problem, not a them problem.

            If the last 500 years are any guide, then there will be multi-system failure and wide spread economic collapse in all sectors except energy, defense, and luxury goods. Nations will become protectionist, which will further depress economies. Food and essential goods distribution will bottleneck at logistic supply chock points. Bank lending will dry up, innovation will be stifled, retooling and rebuilding of manufacturing facilities will be slow. Craftsman guilds and unions will either get larger or be further replaced by automation. There will likely be mass starvation, banditry, organized crime, chemical dependance among the average citizens, further environmental degradation. The wealthy will cloister themselves away from the masses and be less empathetic to the needs of their communities. Educational institutions will deteriorate except the most elite schools. Germ related diseases or infections will increase and human populations will decrease proportionally.

            High Seas piracy will increase.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brazil, Russia, India, China, and Indonesia will fill much of the power vacuum left in the US wake. Africa's infrastructure will continue to develop to supply resources and energy to Asian markets. EU will collapse. Israel will try to find a new benefactor nation to support it, but unfortunately will suffer from its years of alienating neighbors and antagonizing regional competitors.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the last 500 years are not a guide and we need to go back 5000 years as a guide, then resource and energy abundance will turn into resource and energy scarcity. There will be mass die offs of the human species. The rich will be safe for a time, but will eventually be hunted by surviving humans as they turn into a locust like plague on them and their interests.

            It is very unlikely that US hegemony ends without a nuclear exchange. Protecting the hegemony is the sole purpose of those nukes.

<p>In an electric car, the energy lost to braking is (mostly) reclaimed by the battery, so stop and go traffic is much less of a problem.   Slow speeds are also  a problem, the non/slow-moving state isn\'t consuming anything really.  Their peak efficiency is below 30mph.  Basically the driving pattern that governs electric vehicle energy consumption is speed (energy lost to air resistance and tire deformation).    The #1 fear of electric vehicle drivers is the limited range.   The marketed ranges for the vehicles are in slow city traffic, and at room temperature, which is their ideal condition.   Most of the heavily marketed cities have winter temps where these ranges are cut in half.  Driving at a normal highway speed also cuts this range in half, or worse: <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-s-efficiency-and-range">https://www.tesla.com/blog/model-s-efficiency-and-range</a></p>
<p>So a winter highway drive in an electric car rated for 150 miles will only make it ~40 miles if you are lucky if you drive the speed of the rest of traffic.  Because of this, I keep seeing electric car drivers slow to 25 on the highway, with nobody in front of them.  The right lane is occupied by traffic crawling because of people that don\'t know how to safely merge/exit highway traffic, exacerbated by ridiculously sharp curved long island entrance/exit ramps.  The left lane is stuck behind electric cars going 25.  And the middle lane is stop and go from people cutting each other off escaping the other two.   Effectively, the *rise of electric vehicle use is <strong>causing</strong> stop and go traffic, and forcing the other vehicles to use more fuel!  Electric cars should not be allowed on the highways, both for safety and for ecological reasons!</p>
<p>This seems a bit organic for a &quot;conspiracy&quot; in and of itself, but what do you think are the <strong>real</strong> reasons electric cars are being pushed so hard the past year or two?</p>',

            Lets see, dig up oil or coal, burn it and get electricity, transmit the electricity, compensate for transmission losses, charge car battery. It just seems wasteful already. I  do question the costs on the back end, the cost of recycling the battery, and the cost of disposing of the chemicals properly though.

             Apart from losing about one third of the 330 km range at temps around freezing, here's some advantages that I noticed with my EV:
            </p>
            <p>
             - Always starts
            </p>
            <p>
             - Possibilty of remote pre-heating for a nice and comfy start of the drive, including heated seats. Pre-heat can be used in garage because it doesn't create noxious gases.
            </p>
            <p>
             - Even without pre-heat, the heat works immediately, no need for an engine block to warm up.
            </p>
            <p>
             - No extra wear on engine parts due to cold starts
            </p>
            <p>
             - Excellent handling on snow due to smooth torque management
            </p>
            <p>
             This is my third winter with this car.

            Limited range. Ability to be shut down remotely. Ability to take over control remotely. Combine with Geo fencing and you have a set up where only those with permission get to leave the citadel/city limits.

            You want better fuel efficiency? Strap a pneumatic pump and air tank into your petrol car to recapture braking energy.

            Battery cars are the most retarded thing ever. It's obviously a conspiracy and part of agenda 30.

            The Achilles Heel of electric vehicles is winter driving. Gas-powered vehicles generate an enormous amount of surplus heat. The problem with gas-powered cars is getting rid of all that extra heat. But with electrics, there is not enough heat generated in winter to keep the car, and its passengers, from freezing up. Plus, cold reduces greatly the output of batteries. I can see electric cars being useful in Florida and southern California, but not in Michigan or Montana.

             They aren't useful in Florida because a) the speeds are too high and distances too far.  b) the battery efficiency also drops precipitously at high temperatures c) absolutely life threatening to not have the AC cranked.  You aren't going to make it 50 miles on a full battery.  Or 25 miles on the highway.  An electric car could never make it across alligator alley, the exits are too far apart.

            ridiculous post. My Chevy Volt gets the same milage at highway speeds or in the city - around 38 miles. However cold weather is a significant drain on the battery. Temp is more important than speed in draining batteries.

             25 is not an appropriate highway speed.

              2013 Volts go 38 miles on their electric charge. Then the small gas motor kicks in to recharge the battery so the electric motir keeps running the car. The Volt has a 7.5 gallon tank and averages 37 mpg when running on gas. Add that to the 38 miles of pure electric charge power and the car goes about 315 miles per electric charge/gas fill up. I run on electric 95% of the time since most of the time I just travel around my smallish FL city.

              It would get fewer eletric miles in cold weather. Brr. Bad for electric cars.

<p>The recent bombing of the hospital, the actions of Putin and Russia bombing ISIS and the US response... the US has spent 40 years being &quot;the bad guy&quot; of our own doing, by invading and overthrowing other countries, but now it seems to be accelerating to a farcical level. Maybe it\'s just the media I consume, maybe lots of people see it happening too, I don\'t know. </p>
<p>The Govt is backing Israel, funding and supporting Saudi Arabia... giving them billions a year in free money, which they\'re mostly required to spend buying US arms and military equipment. It supports our economy, which is about 1/5 military-industrial complex. But now we\'re just flat-out giving guns to Al Qaeda, ISIS, etc, to destabilize Russian-friendly governments, so that the US govt can take them over and install US-friendly govts. And Russia is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Proxy wars are where the rebels are one side and the local national government is the other side, and the US funds and arms one of them, and Russia funds and arms the other. Ukraine, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran have all been in this situation for decades. </p>
<p>But then you learn the most odd thing, after learning all this. You learn that the bankers who the US government is beholden to, the reason it has $17 trillion dollars of debt instead of just creating its own money for free, those very groups of people also run the russian banks. They own both sides. There\'s no real Russia vs US conflict any more than there is a Pepsi vs Coke conflict. It\'s a matter of branding and PR. One rich family\'s feud against another, at best.  
</p>
<p>Why do they create war? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>War is profitable and harnesses lots of human effort to create a more efficient profit machine. They corral existing sentiments of nationalism/patriotism and harness it to create great technology and systems of social organization. War is a discovery machine, at the expense of millions of humans\' lives. And the owners of nations get first dibs on the new tech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The divide and conquer strategy pits two equally-powerful social hierarchies against each other (Russia vs US) which focuses the power they contain against each other, instead against the powerful wealthy few people controlling both of them. Because without a doubt, if the energy of hundreds of millions of people were focused toward removing exactly only those at the very top of the hierarchy, it would be accomplished very quickly. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the most important defense of a hundred-billionaire is something called &quot;plausible deniability&quot;. The more layers, the better. They have to have reasons why they didn\'t do it, why the guys <em>below</em> them did it. That\'s why they never get caught, because there\'s a million layers of shit protecting them: intelligence, PR, connections, security, money, lawyers, yes-men, family history, and a good bullshit story. Plausible deniability. This keeps them safe and powerful, despite the accusations of many. The corruption of our justice system in recent decades especially allows for this.</p>
<p>Governments are merely interfaces between the powerful and the citizens, scar tissue from their interaction, which is why they are so slow to get anything done and have so much bureaucracy. It is scar-tissue to safeguard, slow down, and mitigate interactions between one side and the other.  
</p>
<p>So to have a global narrative going forward, they <em>have</em> to have a good guy and a bad guy. This is how everyone will talk about it, after it happens, just like WW2. The US looks like a bad guy from actions all over the world over the last 50+ years, but if we paint it with a more intense brush, then we can make it look like they\'re just pure satan incarnate, then the world won\'t feel bad dogpiling on them in a world war situation.  I feel like that narrative is slowly being painted before our eyes, &quot;the US is bad like you already thought, but it\'s even worse and they\'re corrupt to the bone, they deserve this&quot;. </p>
<p>If there were a war, then this narrative keeps the elite safe in their positions of power. This is a thick layer of plausible deniability. &quot;The <em>US govt</em> are the bad guys, not the international central bankers!&quot; </p>
<p>During a war, everyone is intensely distracted by nationalism, promoted by the media. Then this becomes the new history and the world rolls on, thinking it has defeated a true evil nation in the world, while in reality giving even more power for those powerful few at the top, who own both sides. </p>
<p>This is the level our national dialogue needs to be at. Not at the level of MSM. Let\'s wake up and get real about this stuff. Talk to people you know about these details. When shit hits the fan there will be a lot of anger, and it\'s important to make sure that anger is not directed inappropriately to scapegoats of racism, sexism, religions, or even nationalism! </p>

            IMHO:
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a cabal of zionist, bloodline only families that have had control over many very important things the last few hundred years. This family has mainly been in control of the Federal Reserve banking system, which is owned by the same family that owns the Bank of England. If you look at wars the USA has fought and compare the belligerent countries with those lacking a central, federal reserve bank there is an interesting trend. Its almost as if we invade a country, destroy enough of it to require a rebuilding, then install a Federal bank to loan that country money to rebuild. We also typically install a political entity that sympathizes with the efforts our leadership has instituted within itself - mainly westernization and homogenization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, no, the USA isn't necessarily being painted as the bad guy - it IS the badguy. We've been asleep letting the wolves run the show and they've not made many friends. In fact, they've made more enemies than friends. Either way though - the cabal is losing. They've been told to cease and desist. We're seeing the death throes of this cabal in their attempt to remain in power and control. But they cannot because everything we are doing is 100% unsustainable. It. Cannot. Last.

            Totally possible. In bombing ISIS, Vladimir Putin has revealed that western governments have been supporting terrorists this entire time, and never even
            <em>
             tried
            </em>
            to fight terrorism. The US government is the real terrorist organization, and people truly are waking up to that. Problem is, clearly we the people have no control over the situation whatsoever. We are captive to the violent whims of our government as they rest of the world. This empire is in decline, don't bother trying to save it. Focus on saving yourself and the ones you love.

<p>This somehow strange but obvious statement made me sit back and rethink the circumstances surrounding the late representative from Baltimore Elijah Cummings, the most powerful political voice on lowering drug prices besides the President. In October of 2019, news of his death surprised many despite his 25-year-old rare cancer diagnosis and a myriad of health setbacks suffered over the years while in hospital for routine procedures. </p>
<p>By all reports, Cummings had looked relatively energetic and chipper all that summer, vigorously fighting Trump over remarks made about Baltimore being “a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess” and tweeting on Sept. 25th, “Drug companies are reaping astronomical profits off of the backs of millions of American families, forcing people to make impossible choices, to sacrifice their health, and to jeopardize their lives.” Three weeks later Cummings was dead with over a million in unspent cash in his campaign coffers. </p>
<p>A little background and conspiratorial surmise:</p>
<p>In 1994, Rep. Cummings was diagnosed with thymic carcinoma. Thymic carcinoma is a 1/10th subset of all thymic epithelial tumors, which itself has a reported incidence of only <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/631n0k.png">3.2 cases per 1,000,000</a>. Not only are there incredibly few cases, but <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/ctn4v9.png">even fewer people under 50</a> contract the cancer like Cummings did and almost no one lives with it chronically for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kevin Cullen, director of the (((University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center))), which has received millions of federal dollars from the U.S. gov often at the behest of Cummings himself, said he’s never seen a thymic carcinoma patient live with the disease as long as Cummings did.</p>
<p>Neither has (((Dr. Abigail Berman))), an assistant professor of radiation oncology who specializes in the disease at U of Penn. She states, &quot;[The cases] are very rare and aggressive. It\'s rare to have it so long, but there are always outliers.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, either Cummings is one of these outstanding outliers even the most well-versed doctors are baffled by, or Cummings’ condition has been carefully engineered by his handlers over many years, culminating in his timely demise after publicly battling it out with DJT and before his House Committee on Oversight and Reform could follow up on their revelatory July 2019 hearing <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/legislation/hearings/the-patient-perspective-the-devastating-impacts-of-skyrocketing-drug-prices-on">The Patient Perspective: The Devastating Impacts of Skyrocketing Drug Prices on American Families</a>.</p>
<p>If you are rightly skeptical that Cummings’ cancer diagnosis and/or death could have been engineered, I would urge you read about SV-40 and the circumstances surrounding the 1964 death of <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/9r3tew.html">Dr. Mary Sherman</a> or the 2011 death of Canada’s NDP leader <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/js2qay.png">Jack Layton</a> if you haven\'t already and draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Needless to say, eyes on DJT in the coming months, as an attempt on his life could be far more insidious and imperceptible than what most fear.</p>',

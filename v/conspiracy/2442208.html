            Before sesamee street and before Jim henson's puppets dominated the show, the same company created "the electric company" starring a young Bill Cosby. From the beginning, these shows were intended to be part of the nationally-approved grade school curriculum, and folks over 50 can remember watching in school while teachers went for smoke breaks. I would argue that government had an interest from the start, whether it's the CIA or various civilian departments, or all together.

            As for Jim, the story that seems to be most prevalent is that he was a gay man actively having sex in a place and time known for the early spread of aids. His studio wasn't owned by Disney until after his death (or close to it, cant remeember) If you want to dissect what looks like a clash of ideologies within a kids show, check out fraggle rock.

            Not just the Muppets buddy. "Children's television" in general is a tool of brainwashing. They don't even lie about that, they just call it "education". 
Education is a very subjective term... what is being taught falls by the wayside as long as SOMETHING is being taught. Now we are seeing that something is a bit more important than lazy boomers thought. 
Educational ptogramming is exactly that, programming. They never said it wasnt.

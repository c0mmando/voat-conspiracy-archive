            Look up Bill Gates's "quantum dot tattoo" technology which uses an enzyme called "luciferase" to light up when it receives certain signals.  They'll use this together with tiny microchips to have permanently implanted vaccinations records so they know you're a safe, sterilized, testosterone-free shabbos goy.

            I am preparing for that exact thing, but luckily for me this is not a move out of the blue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not of the mind that God is all that fond of consumerism, in fact I'd say God despises it as much as centralized power structures as forms of govenment. With that said I do not think that this is just about figured ng out how I can still be a consumer fully dependent on the system without recieving the mark.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mark is literally a harmless dot of invisible ink, but getting one shows a commitment to an evil and strange system of economy(means of sustenance).
           </p>
           <p>
            So I have been preparing for this since I was a child. When I learned you can't buy or sell with out the mark it was obvious God does not want his people dependent on buying and selling which leads a people into uselessness.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we have until this time next year I will easily have enough food growing to feed more than one household, and doing it in a way that produces higher quality produce, with higher yields from plants that are healthier and more resistant to pest and environmental stresses than regular organic or synthetic farms and where everything used in the process is made from readibly available resources instead of a farm dependent on consumer practices.
           </p>
           <p>
            My life came into being just for this event.

             <p>
              I live in a very small town out in the middle of nowhere. It is not even really separated from the wilderness that surrounds it. It is not rural it is wilderness.
             </p>
             <p>
              There isn't much work out here, the town was left destitute by the logging industry that left it.
             </p>
             <p>
              People around here are very resourceful because it is a two hour drive to the nearest hardware store. Things get improvised, fixed and recycled by the community.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have a few sayings here, one of them is "3 sticks of dynamite to independence", meaning that if the shit hits the fan we can close off all the ways in to town with three sticks of dynamite.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another saying is "blank takes care of blank"
             </p>
             <p>
              where the word blank is the name of the town/community I live in, but I don't want to mention that name. For context I will say we are basicly California-Oregon area known locally as the 51st state of the USA, the State of Jefferson.
             </p>
             <p>
              So the community I'm a part of is a very different type of place to begin with. People work for trade all the time when one person in the arrangement can't pay for their end. Not oppressed by the stuff structure that grips the world and forces people into. An example is I will trim trees even if you can't afford itfor a percentage of the produce from that tree, or for firewood, or chickens for butchering or some kind of meat.
             </p>
             <p>
              2/3 of my rent is pay d by trade to the land lord for tree trimming, including the orchard on the property which I also get half the produce from, so I will likely pay my rent by various forms of rent.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is not likely that they are going to switch to a cashless society for a while, but that is obviously on the agenda.
             </p>
             <p>
              Until they do I will still be able to earn money by working off the books, and setting up an honor system produce stand.
             </p>
             <p>
              As long as cash is still in circulation there will also be black market . There are things that can be grown and black marketed.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would not surprise me if the whole town opposed the strangle hold and ended up supporting and backing eachoter in sovereignty. Unlike other places even other small rural towns, people here really have each other's backs when it comes down to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, it seems to me that although things will never go back to the way things have been as in capitalist-consumerist system of things, at least according to the bible prophecy that points out that all the merchants and traders to prosper from that system cried and mourned her death when she crumbled, that the grip of the oppressive system that is tightening more and more everyday and is about to get worse when the vaccine is released will only be around for a few more years before something happens that causes it to crumble and a new system of things will arise. It will likely arise from places like this that stay productive and become self sufficient.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the absolute worst comes to worst I will pack up what ever food and resources I can into the woods and ride it out in hiding with my child for the few years that it lasts.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know how and what to forage. There are acorns and other food everywhere. I have already started foraging for acorns because they are going to be the key to being able to thrive, and not just us vive through this. I collected about 49 lbs this year, but next year I will start on time and with the same effort I gave this year starting late I can easily get her over 10olbs of acorns in a day or two.
             </p>
             <p>
              I ended up out here because as I said, from child hood I have been preparing for this. I am from so California, I have lived in NYC, but my heart was not only not interested in accumulating worldly wealth, but I became interested in self sufficiency from an early age. Through a course of events I ended up here, instead of in the city or suburbs.

              Other people ignored the same warning of not being able to buy or sell without the mark, but they still directed their energy into accumulating wealth and placed their faith in money and saw money as the answer to their problems so they ended up, or remained in those places where they will be immediately vulnerable to the extortion that will be starting it's commencement just as soon as the vaccine is approved although it probably won't go full bore for a while.

            Fuck them. Either the front lines people pushing this are going to be continually eliminated or the people climb to the top and get rid of them.

            This has happened for thousands of years. But we used to not have to worry about phone tracking and people just trained and huddled up in their towns sharpening their blades.

            Something similar is happening though.

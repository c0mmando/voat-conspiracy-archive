            Sadly even though we find ourselves "waking up" to the real Powers That Be scenario currently in control - we still view it as ENTERTAINMENT and not as FIRE UNDER OUR ASSES.  It's becoming another thing to have learned from Google and forgotten just as quickly.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact of the matter is this: Power is not given; it is seized! One of, some of us, all of us must seize it.  We know from  whom, and we know how - we're just too damn comfortable to actually break through the matrix and do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So for now, we enjoy the entertainment aspect of knowing about it - all of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            We truly are pathetic suckers - and that includes my simple self - the most.
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually there is a so-called group of fighters/decapitators taking on the matrix architects, but we can't refer to them in any other fashion than disdainfully. You know of whom I speak.

            Great wonderful post! These things are becoming more obvious to the people, and so now is the time to give them the direction towards what we can all do with this awareness. I actually created a sub
            <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedWeStand">
             /r/UnitedWeStand
            </a>
            and there also exists a similar one on reddit. The point of my sub is basically what you stated yourself. That sub is foundation to connect people together who have started to see this too, and to get working towards those goals.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have thought more about these things, and so if you are willing to converse about it, I will share my thoughts on what is stopping us from doing something about it, and how once we get past our hindrances, we can work towards attaining these goals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Still a wonderful path you are walking on. And you friend is right, we will have to play a game with TPTB, and everything else that stands in the way.

             to try to get a category in the main sub menu for these kinds of topics, but there were very little people to help support it. I've even wrote up
             <a href="http://whoaverse.com/v/Conspiracy/comments/26173">
              great points
             </a>
             towards how it is a progressive move that is ahead of its time if implemented. I feel the more people who are wiling to voice their concern to introduce a free &amp; open community to discuss such a cultural movement, the sooner it can be embraced &amp; used to inspire/educate others.

            Over the course of the past year, I have been surprised by the amount of people I run into that are aware of many issues that are going on. Since they are so diverse, theres seems to be something everyone can piece together to form a bigger puzzle. I believe its this key self education that will ultimately help the majority populous against those who wish to control or tyrant over them. Even having a conversation with my father, he is just baffled when he discovers whats been going on for so long he was previously unaware of. I see this happening with a lot of people, even in everyday Americans - I treat these moments like gems where you can actually express truth in a critical thinking conversation

             Gems.  Good term.  I am noticing the same, people are more turned on.  Even people who are still ignorant and lacking sources of good information are agitated.

              i think most people can sense something is wrong at some level, but its hard to put their finger on it.

               Great documentary.  I watched this and Money Masters on a Sat a while ago.  Then I read War is a Racket about a week later... Haven't been right since.

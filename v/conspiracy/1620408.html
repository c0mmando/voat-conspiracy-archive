            Vaccines fuck around with a baby's immune system before they even have a properly functioning immune system. They can and do cause auto-immune diseases.

            Since this in conspiracy here's one for you. Why is it white people who think letting their kid die from disease is better than vaccinating them? Add to that the idea of euthanasia as a white thing. Few others are crying out for it. Abortions are mainly white and black unless it's sex selective abortion coming from one of the cultures that kills girls anyway.

             Sorry, most of those diseases are not deadly or crippling in any way. There are a lot of toally stupid vaxinations like flu. Exceptions, like polio, exist. Measels vaccine is more dangerous than naturally getting measels ... let that sink in.

              I grew up with a kid who was deaf because her mother was exposed to measles while she was pregnant with her. You don't see that anymore, so you don't think it can happen. It used to happen more frequently. The kids were sent to boarding schools for the deaf.those schools weren't tiny, they were large. Up until the early 1980's two and a half million people a year died of measles. Shrug away polio if you want, but it was deadly in real life, not just in your imagination. Between 3 to 5% of the entire population died of the flu after ww 1 
People still die of the flu.

              Look up small pox on wiki.
             </p>
             <p>
              But then overpopulation is a huge problem and people dying is what nature is all about. Just don't bother imagining that means people in far away, undeveloped  parts of the world that you have no business with. It means you and your family as well.

               If you are referring to the Spanish Influenza epidemic, is started DURING WWI, and it wasn't the flu that killed so many. It was the immunological response to it. That's why it killed mostly the young and healthy and spared the very young and the elderly. And why transmission was so high; soldiers returning to and being shipped off to war. 
 Deaths from "influenza" today are mostly the immune compromised, those on chemo,  dialysis, the elderly with secondary problems, and a large part of the population is afflicted with 'first world diseases' like cardiovascular, diabetes and cancer, making them more likely to die from a secondary infection that  causes organ failure because they already are one foot in the grave. Most of your big pharma drugs give alerts that if you have TB or exposed to certain diseases, not to take them because they essentially KILL your immune system.

               don't fret on that buttercup, the marxists are fomenting WWIII as we speak to take care of that "overpopulation" problem.

                Ugh. People don't die from cancer, they die drom their body's response to it. People who die from the flu are not all elderly, or ill with something else. Also the flu viruses mutate constantly. It may or my not be a good thing to get flu shots.  I generally do not. But I've never seen a valid or good argument against them. Except for quit saving everybody as a general phisophy.

             Nobody dies of chicken pox, but the pharmaceutical industry doctors are pushing a vaccine for that now. We stopped vaccinating against small pox over here before it was eradicate worldwide, but we still vaccinate against polio even when the the only way you're going to get polio here is from a bad vaccine. If you think there isn't industry collusion with the government, then you're naive.

              Chicken pox and it's residual, shingles blinds or kills very few. Some, but few. Pregnant women can pass it to the fetus and brain damage and other mutations happen. Again few. It only matters if it's your fetus that gets it. Then those people become tragically alarmed.

               All the diseases we vaccinate for are rare in their most traumatic form. Vaccines are one of the most obvious places where the mind control manipulation of history is so evident. Polio was never, statistically speaking, the scourge that many vaccine advocates like to invoke. Neither was smallpox, unless you were a native north american in the 1600s and the best evidence I've seen is that the reason the people's of the western hemisphere were so susceptible to European diseases was because they didn't practice much animal agriculture (source of most human disease) but did live in a parasite rich environment which meant that their immune systems were geared to parasites and not diseases.

                 from a pro vax website. At it's peak polio infected less than 60,000 americans at a time when there were approximately 153,000,000 americans. That is around 4 hundredths of a percent or about 4 cases per 10,000 people. The peak death rate was around the same time (early 50s) and killed fewer than 3500 hundred americans. So it killed something like 2 people per 100,000.  I don't see how that is a serious threat to anyone?

                  You really don't know what a shill is, so why would anyone stupidly believe you know anything else? Dying from polio is and was the least of a polio victims problems.

                   getting polio is the least of most people's problems. At it's peak it was infecting 4 people per 10,000 and the vast majority of polio cases were not much more than inconvenient flu-like symptoms. But yeah, considering that only 5 people per 100,000 that got polio would die I suppose you could say dieing would be a small worry. That's exactly my point.
And you're a shill because you propagate noisy fear monger nonsense with no evidence. Please direct me to anything at all that indicates that vaccines solve anything. I'm open to information, but all of my own investigating (fresh, i have a child that is almost a year old and live in california where not vaccinating will mean that i cannot send them to licensed child care or public school) has shown me that vaccines are not worth the risk when you are dealing with a healthy child

                      There's no getting through tosomeone like you. You know what herd immunity is and you do not care. Because of the civil breakdown, there's bern reoccurrences of polio in Syria. You do not care. It isn't your kid being infected yet so it simply doesn't exist enough in your reality to matter. You'll sit in your cat bird seat feeling all smug and smarter than all those stupid experts who are obviously trying to get one over on you. Until your kid catches something.

                       total straw man arguments. Of course it's sad that people get diseases, that children get diseases, that people suffer at all. All I've asked from you is to provide some evidence that vaccination is a statistically meaningful mode of prevention.  What do you think herd immunity means? The lowest vaccination rates on the west coast by county are in the high 80 percent range. Most communities have more than 90% immunization and yet we still see occasional outbreaks. I don't think these experts are trying to get one over I just think they are acting within the paradigm they exist in and I think there are some fundamental mistakes at the root of it.
                       <br/>
                       Unless you have any actual evidence that vaccines are statistically meaningful preventions of these diseases then I just have to say good luck to you and hopefully all of our loved ones can avoid disease and live full happy lives

Course there is a vaccine for that, too.

                Nope, an official retraction is in order.  :)   sooooo.  Why does the military still vaccinate for smallpox before you are allowed to step foot in some foreign countries?  Also I thank you for pushing me into looking for more information on this specific subject.  I did find there was a recent outbreak of measles in disneyland no too long ago.  Good thing i have never been there nor do i ever plan on going.

                 The USA and Russia still retain samples of smallpox, which they might weaponize. This is probably the reason why they still vaccinate against it.

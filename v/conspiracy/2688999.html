            The case of the worst mass shooting gets more and more suspicious.
           </p>
           <p>
            He had no motive, wasn't connected to basically anyone, and by coincidence, had a gf that worked for the FBI..... Sounds like a conspiracy to me. Back to one of the original theories then.
FBI operation gone wrong.
Arms deal set up, FBI come in at the last minute to bust it, saves the day and gets recognition for protecting U.S. citizens.
Targets turn up at wrong time/place.
Realize something is wrong.
Shoot the shit out of concert next door to cause chaos.
Escape in the confusion.
FBI realizes they've fucked up big.
Puts pressure on local police to come up with a story.
Police cannot create proper story and information gets jumbled and contradictory. I am convinced it was an arms deal / hit rolled up into one that went bad and they used the mass shooting to escape. Paddock was dead after they entered the room to get the guns from him. Edit for a little clarity Bin Salmans were not supposed to inherit the throne so the Al Waleed branch sends a strike team to Vegas. FBI/CIA needs to give them weapons to take down the bodyguards and Salman the FBI/CIA have Paddock get the the guns and ammo into the room. They fail it all goes to shit and they cover it up with the mass shooting so the team can get away and leave Paddock there as the scapegoat. I am convinced now Chertoff/Adleson instructed acedemi pmc mercs to leak Paddocks identity to black lives matter, cartel, mafia, antifa, ISIS to show up, kill Paddock, take the guns, and go Hogg wild up and down the strip while acedemi shot the strip up and killed civilians too, Al Waleed duped the FBI/CIA into helping him assassinate Salman and the 5 faces of evil were party crashers. And then every body with a gun shot every body with a gun and the whole strip up Smokin' Aces style. It started as a arms deal/hit and possible gun sting, it became insider trading and a inside job committed by Adleson/Chertoff.

            SP and MLD were probably like Barry Seal/Whitey Bulger/Yuri Orlov. And informants on the FBI's take like Whitey Bulger. Iran Contra 2 on steroids. This the scandal of my generation and of the decade and century.

            FUCK THE FBI, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED LVMPD !!5UXuopZd8aK ID:MaEh0Stq Tue 03 Oct 2017 15:03:36 No.143901308
The LVMPD knows the motive behind the attack, but the FBI will not allow LVPD to release the motive because it implicates the FBI in illegal arms deals and supplying arms to ISIS terrorists within U.S. borders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI agent who participated in multiple illegal arms deals in the Las Vegas area in a gun running entrapment scheme similar to Fast and Furious. Paddock thought he was engaging in another routine arms transfer, but ISIS had learned about the entrapment scheme and Paddock's true identity. They killed him and carried out the massacre, and then fled the scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything is being kept under extreme wraps because 1) armed ISIS terrorists are still at large and 2) this is very embarrassing to the FBI and they don't want their scheme to become public knowledge.
I had always believed the shootings were part of the SA coup attempt. The prince was across the street at the Tropicana when it happened - video shows it. The top floors of the Mandalay Bay are owned by Saudi’s. The timing fits too.
Not hard to believe. Some anon had, shared what appeared to be a photo of Paddock and his wife having, dinner with a California senator that got prison time for dealing, arms, to the Philippines, we think that was him... Maybe. I can no, longer find the photo. Ironic that on March 26 2014 the Californian senator got arrested and on November 29 2014 a guy went up to the 20 or so floor of the Mandalay Bay with an arsenal of long rifles and planned on shooting up the strip and he got busted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vegas shooting is what lead, me here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything and everything the FBI touches is tainted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Was Paddock setup by the girlfriend? Was she in on it from the get-go? RELEASE THE DOCUMENTS!
           </p>
           <p>
            Where the fuck is she right now?
           </p>
           <p>
            The articles don't give a time frame in which she was paid. Was she receiving these payments when she "met" Paddock? Was this another Fast and Furious gun running deal gone wrong? Many government stings end up backfiring and creating havoc. This info really shows us what a can of worms the Vegas shooting was.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vegas shooting is a cesspool of WTHeck. Multiple shooters? 911 calls that don't fit the story. Saudi ties? Choppers? Two broken windows. F'd up time lines. Unhinged lone wolf or multi actor deception?
           </p>
           <p>
            Appears all the shootings and other events always include people that have connections to the FBI I find that very strange
Agree so much with this. The FBI's reach continues to expand unchecked. The bureau has clearly been deeply corrupted, even beyond how Hoover ran it. A nest of vipers at the administrative level. It has good components, like the forensic labs, but those could be folded into existing agencies or create a new, very circumscribed, agency. As you nicely phrase it -- the FBI is the government hit squad.
Just another reason to shut down the FBI completely. It was formed under controversy and corruption and nothing has changed. The FBI is the hit squad of the government, more directly the democrats. We have and have always had for 230 years the US Marshals office that has a good history.
Guns in one direction to the Philippines then kids in the crates on the way back!
           </p>
           <p>
            If the clowns are involved you can bet theirs child trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see from Sheriff Lombardos statements stuttering under FBI Aaron Rouse's death stare that they were not prepared for the event.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this was a classic false flag they all would have been ready and, being the biggest shooting in history this could have been Parkland x 100000. But NOONE was, save for just Killary with a meagre single tweet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think there was MUCH more to this. Paddock was a gun runner yes. Remember this took place close the the Saudi Arabian purge by Bin Salman. That was the first BIG sign of global swamp draining and cooperation of white hats with Trump. George Soros shorted a huge amount of MGM stocks in the build up to the Vegas attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            My theory, though currently mainly guesswork. Is that Trump, or Bin Salman, or some VERY significant people were in Las Vegas that night. And globalists like Soros had caught wind of the meeting. (Remember, This was earlyish into the deep state draining that picked up pace after this event, so the DS could have still had uncompromised communication methods and spies at that point).
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros/Globalists caught wind of the meeting. No time to communicate with FBI. Sleeper cell/agents in the US hit squad activated to take out targets at whatever cost, with deep state controlled ISIS to take responsibility for the attack - shifting blame from most likely Deep state govt/Israeli/Mossad agents. Dozens of hitmen at the event, reports of guns shots all over the las vegas strip.
           </p>
           <p>
            Concert attack used to distraction authorities and create chaos. Gunshots importantly also heard at the airport/runway quite a while after initial shots. Deep state Targets making their escape?
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless, After everything weve witnessed it would seem their plan FAILED. and the Deep state will continune to FAIL. And we will WIN.
           </p>

            How do we know the terrorists didn't load the magazines themselves or bring their own guns once they got there? If they went up the stairwell, they could have snuck the guns up maybe. But even in the room after them ambushed him, the timeline would aline so that they would have time to load the guns themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paddock wasn't just running guns, he was also selling ammunition in general, and it's open source that a lot of the ammo in his room was a special type of advanced bullet he had bought from somewhere else.
           </p>
           <p>
            This coup they're attempting has gone south. They all get to go to jail now.

            So basically this mass murder rampage was supposed to have our 2A removed and all of us law abiding citizens would be unarmed for the takeover by our own government!! This plan must have been put in place because they didn’t think she would loose!! Our own government killing its own citizens. Thank God for Trump!! Will these families ever see justice ?? I am SICK!!! 
I saw that earlier on twitter. Wish I could say I was surprised. Seems like every damn man-made tragedy in this country is connected to the FBI. Sickening.
Her fingerprints were on the damn ammo! This is what it looked like from the beginning. They let slip out the extra camera on the service cart, for instance. Plus Paddock himself had long family history back to FBI. And, no one explained very well how he acquired his wealth.
Said from the beginning, Paddock was an undercover gun runner and they were doing a fast and furious type sting operation with ISIS operatives, the ISIS operatives sabotaged it, killed Paddock, and committed a terror act. They even took credit, and their confirmation when they take credit historically is about 96% (they even put it in their propaganda newsletter)...Paddock I thought was C_A, so if his gf was FBI, it would make sense. They were on a covert operation probably wiring money and selling guns in the middle east and Philippines, but ISIS probably discovered his undercover identity and took him out. Something along those lines...Of course he could have just been FBI, too, not C_A. They can't reveal sources and methods bc other human assets were still undercover. Exactly. Thought that second camera on the cart was big too. That would have enabled Paddock to see who was coming and going in preparation and for security. Some PD were accidentally leaking out some details within the first 24 hours, and the reporting was solid, but then Rouse moved in and took over and began concealing information and changing the story that conflicted with the facts that were released.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fox News actually speculated within the first two days that Paddock might be an undercover agent with a special guest on because they said he had no internet/digital online profile or footprints and that's what FBI and C_A do with their undercovers (bc obviously if the enemy ever discovered they were an undercover agent, they would of course either ambush them or discontinue their operation with them in the investigation).

            FBI Involved in Las Vegas Massacre I saw video from the Las Vegas shooting showing concert goers fleeing through a gate and a armed security guard guy with a pistol and yellow vest and in the crowd of fleeing concert goers is a security women with a gun possibly a machine gun and the guy sign languages and motions to her and puts his hand around his throat giving the signal to make a choke point. And this right around where and at the time the black SUV comes by and gets shot at on the right side by a shooter facing the Mandalay Bay on the right side and i think the shooter was a LVMPD officer in light tan brown with yellow security vest and a pistol on the same street as the gate with fleeing concert goers. Remember the shooter in the yellow vest that's kneels and fires i keep showing everybody? Mandalay Bay Security in yellow vest were shooters they shot and killed people with their pistols which would be hard to hear because of larger guns firing.

             Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock, worked for the FBI, according to credit application data the Australian national reported as part of a loan application.
            </p>
            <p>
             That’s the same Danley whose fingerprints were found on Paddock’s horde of ammunition packed into unused rifle magazines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Publicly available intelligence obtained from consumer credit reporting bureaus show Danley claimed the “Federal Bureau of Investigation” as her place of employment.

            nice anagram
She is a FBI/CIA agent this was already confirmed like Peter Strozk.
Remember there were bodies covered in sheets and gunfights at multiple hotels on the strip.
Why are the FBI so treasonous? I mean I know some of the reasons but like come the fuck on you faggots stop killing Americans.
Gotta keep that domestic threat hot so you can keep your job mate. What a fucking joke.

           <p>
            There is a cabal that workj for the FBI and CIA simultaneously. Like Strzok. His dad was a longtime CIA spook and he was appointed to a brand new position when he was a 26 year old "Senior FBI Agent" that would act as liasion between the two agencies.

           <p>
            It was a terror attack 
Paddock thought he was selling guns to criminals. He took care of everything logistically. He supplied all the weapons. Even got them to the room using the freight elevator. His little Mexican valet helped him. Only the criminals weren’t their to buy the guns and they were terrorists working for Alaweed. They killed Paddock. And proceeded to mow down the crown of people with bumpfire ARs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alaweed is in bed with Clinton/Obama crime family and the communist cabal. He was facilitating terror attacks in the US to manipulate stock prices and to attempt to install gun control.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is until he was arrested and all his co-conspirators killed. He was just neutered by MBS.

            Look into it m8. This is the only logical solution. Paddock was there to sell guns, the guys who showed up to buy them had plans to do something else. (Political assassination) Unbeknownst to the assassins, Muhammad bin Salman was out on the Vegas strip when they started locking down the floors above them so they could sweep and murder him. Once they made this realization they initiated the massacre in order to escape by helicopter in the ensuing chaos. One week later, the corruption crackdown takes place in Saudi Arabia, and then MBS becomes king!
           </p>
           <p>
            Actually some of the witnesses were killed later. Especially the vocal ones that tried to start groups and shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also remember thousands of people had their phones confiscated and all data was erased.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell me buddy, are brand new guns from Wal-Mart more effective than decades old trash found in Syria?? 
If the answer is yes, then an arms deal if perfectly plausible. Especially in the Saudi owned part of the Mandalay Bay. (The top 5-4 floors if I’m not mistaken.)
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s right! Remember when 8 people died within weeks of the massacre and the shills were saying
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ”Well, like 20,000 people were witnesses to the event, so random deaths are perfectly understandable.” 
Even though the people dying were ONLY folks who vehemently stated there was more than one shooter and that some shooters were on the ground...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            its been suspected the FBI knew what Paddock was doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            truepundit says Stephens handler Danley was employed by the FBI. Stephen himself only ever worked in government for the postal service and in accounting for Lockheed Martin.

            English speaking -john anon named Chertoff and Adelson without mentioning any foreign Saud activities, only Americans, he practically predicted the whole thing. your saying ISIS did it, it would be good to know but we probably never will.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact Dems and the lib media were pretty mum over the worst mass shooting in American history is proof to me there was more to the story.

            I remember the audio from the police radio was uploaded to YouTube and a bunch of fucking weird shit was happening at the time. Guys dressed in all black clothing getting out of black SUVs in hotel car parks, gunshots being heard in hotel lobbies, cops reporting that they were being shot at, other cops saying they were engaging shooters. It was fucking bizarre. I doubt the video still exists, though.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lots of people who claim they were being shot at in different places. You generally escape before you pull out your phone to record video of it. Some of these people died later.

            The big thing is the Sauds got pushed out by the Salmans. You guys think Bush/Clinton/CIA dont owe them favors and have vested interest to keep them in power in SA?

I listened to him on C2C tonight. Anyways he claims a lot of stuff. One being Nazi created moon and Mars bases. He mentioned Nazis also allied with an Alien race known as the Draco. Since the Nazis knew about aliens they were able to force the US to help them since they could fuck up the US super top secret info on aliens and space travel etc.</p>
<p>Well he mentioned that Iran did the same thing. So I looked it up an indeed Iran did claim Snowden had info on Aliens running the show in the US. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpeck/2014/01/13/iran-says-tall-white-space-aliens-control-america/#7e8df90f2cd5">Forbes</a> articles about it.

<p>Now what I want to know is 1. Why would you give billions of dollars to a country who really believes US is controlled by aliens? Knowing they are trying to make nukes? People hate the fact of people being mentally ill having guns, but nukes? </p>
<p>Unless they were right? Did Iran succesfully blackmail the US?</p>
<p>Also if Nazi\'s had space travel, and moon and Mars bases. WHY THE FUCK DO WE STILL HAVE JEWS?!?!?! For reals? Can get off Earth but cant finish the final solution? Da fuq? hahaha</p>
<p>Crazy stuff to read about.</p>
<p>Also in the presentation I linked above. Corey talks about Antarctica and a lost alien civilization the PTB have been excavating since the early 2000\'s. Ties into all the political elites traveling their recently.</p>',

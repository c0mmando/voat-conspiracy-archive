“It is the sort of behaviour that we would have condemned if it came from China or Russia.“</p>
<p>A 2010 case in England exposes one facet of the worldwide “gang stalking” network. Jane Clift was slanderously placed on a violent offenders list and her details were circulated to community businesses in Slough – doctors, dentists, opticians, libraries, clinics, schools, and more.</p>

<p>The case started in August 2005 when Mrs Clift complained to a Slough authority about a youth trampling a public flower bed. At her trial, she testified that the boy “was in the middle of one of the big flower beds, uprooting plants, pulling the heads off flowers, generally squashing everything.”</p>
<p>She complained about the vandalism incident to Slough Anti-Social Behaviour Coordinator Fozia Rashid.</p>
<p>At the time, the town was encouraging citizens to report anti-social behaviour. But Rashid dismissed Clift’s report of vandalism, and instead suggested that Mrs Clift was at fault. Clift wrote a letter about the incident with Rashid that angered someone on the Council enough to get Clift on the town’s violent offenders list.</p>
<p>Mrs Clift said “What is terrifying is that there is almost no proof required and no hearing to determine the truth of the allegation. It could happen to anybody who gets into even the most minor disagreement with their council.”

            I think there's a real case for Hiroshima and Nagasaki to be hit with fuel air bombs as it was typical operating procedure for American forces because most of the Japanese infrastructure was wood at the time. Plus fire raids were quite common, I think the Americans fire bombed those two cities and then invented the nuclear hoax as a menacing psychological weapon against other nations. Historical revisionism and misinformation from western governments is so rampant, its rather hard not to question if history and the authenticity of reports are even real.

            I question this because I'm finding just WWI-II just unreal, one thing that easily blows a hole in their lies is the holocaust myth, Fred Leuchter does a great job exposing this as he was the primary and chief manufacturer of death equipment for state prisons and the one to handle the largest prison gas chamber projects. His report made for a defendant in a Canadian case is further verified by certified chemist Gremar Rudolf. The amount of revisionism is just sickening. Hitler from what I've found was a another Gaddafi, a real nationalist leader then a banking whore under some sort of Zionist cult as all western leaders are.

            There is no way the Nazi's had any kind of atomic weaponry. They would have deployed it left and right in 1944 and 1945 when the war was very apparently going against them. Hell, if they were able to deploy atomic weapons in Normandy and on London, the western allies very well could have capitulated.

             These are the weapons I'm talking about, however even though they were used most of Hitler's forces we're obliterated in the Siberian grinder.

            What your four States have in common are powerful and entrenched Unions and Guilds.

            Antifa and BLM is doing Collective Bargaining on a Global scale. Blackmail and extortion use fear porn to drive mobs into emotional and irrational fear mongers. The goal is divide and conquer to distract logical reasoning of highly intelligent beings. Socially accepted mask wearing is behavioral modification through fear. Works great IMHO.

             It's worse than you think. Those are all port heavy areas (international trade).

            Thank the gods for the formidable geography of the United states.  If roads and bridges were suddenly impassable or nonexistent they'd have a super hard time even leaving the coastal areas. Theres mountains and deserts to the west, there are mountains and rivers to the east. The Mississippi river and the great plains.
            <br/>
            Just make sure they cant leave the coast, and wait it out, once they are starving to death like zombies in the streets push them into the ocean.

            It's the only answer that will work. Society as it is now functioning is falling apart. It needs the imposition of moral laws, and people need to understand that unless they follow those laws, they are looking at chaos and destruction. Islam will impose a system of laws by force, under threat of torture and execution; wouldn't it be nice if people would return to their own religion, Christianity, of their own accord? Instead of finding an alien religion of sand niggers imposed upon them by force? Because there is no third option.

             I think 99% of the pagan shit is LARPing/subversion.

             Notice how that

             pagan account LightningandtheSun disappeared a couple months back? Did nothing but spam pro-pagan shit and constantly shit on Christianity. I and a few others called the bitch out and it eventually left.

             didn't hear him say we had to be Christian, just not nihilistic aethists....

             If you think about what has kept kikes together all these years is their voracious ethnocentrism &amp; Messianism that they are chosenites meant to rule us all by destiny of God.  Those who oppose israel oppose God, literally.  A belief.  Jews used to say "Next Year in Jerusalem".  Now they don't need to.  The belief helped them to visualize their goals, take action, feel momentum as they watched and celebrated their progress in achieving their goals, just like athletics or anything else.

              Lies have kept them together.  They have brainwashed most Christians into believing they are "gods chosen people", and I believe they may have been until they turned their backs on god.  If you ask most Christians they'd probably tell you Jews will go to heaven.  But if you're a Christian, you should know that the Bible very clearly states that THE ONLY way into heaven is through our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.  Jews absolutely despise Jesus Christ.  Now I'm a Christian, and this was very difficult to wrap my head around.  But once you accept the truth, everything makes more sense.

              As a jew, and as someone much more familiar with Jewish history and custom than the average person, (especially here) I can tell you this is true. The dogged refusal to integrate, is exactly why we are still here, and also why Jews have been chosen as the scapegoats for tyrants so many times, precisely because they stand out due to refusal to adopt the characteristics and customs of the locals. Not just that, but the Jewish emphasis on education, community, and ethical behavior has kept the community insular and supportive of one another.

            One morning there is a man inside his house drinking coffee when he hears a loud knock at the door.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Knock Knock Knock!"
            </p>
            <p>
             He is startled and walks over to the door quietly to see who it is without letting them know that there is someone home
            </p>
            <p>
             He looks through the peep hole but can't see anyone and decides to ask

             "Hello? Who is there?"

             He hears a sudden reply:
            </p>
            <p>
             "IT IS I! JESUS! LET ME IN!
            </p>
            <p>
             The man replies back...
            </p>
            <p>
             "Jesus? Why should I believe you? Why should I let you in?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus replies to him
            </p>
            <p>
             "I NEED TO SAVE YOU! LET ME IN!"
            </p>

             "Save me..? Save me from what...?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus pounds on the door like a madman and screams
            </p>
            <p>
             "FROM WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO YOU IF YOU DON'T LET ME IN!"

            The next time a christian of any kind tries to convert you and you ask them questions and they tell you that if you don't convert that you will go to hell forever, tell them this joke, and explain to them that this is why you will never convert to christianity, because you never negotiate with terrorists.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it unusual that we're in the matrix/womb hell simulation physical realm false reality and christians believe that jesus is the son of god, yet jesus dies on the cross and instead of going to heaven he resurrects and flies away, still physically flying away in physical space, as in "the air" as in "on earth" and flies to some physical location far away in the sky or something. I think that this is more proof that jesus is satan because satan wants to be the master of the physical realm, and therefor would not exit this reality because god would kick satans ass no problem so satan can't really try to take over heaven. jesus doesn't die and stay dead and go to heaven because he's not the boss of heaven. He's the boss of hell, so he resurrects again, because he comes back to LIFE as in "this world" again and not the better real reality of heaven. Why come back to life if life is not the superior reality? If jesus flew away after ressurecting, then that means he's still in the physical realm, as in INSIDE THIS REALITY. False god of a False reality = satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            -if jesus died for our sins then why is the world still full of sin?
           </p>
           <p>
            -If god is all powerful then why did he need to lower himself into sin and destruction to save everyone?
           </p>
           <p>
            -If god is all powerful then why would he make everyone damned to hell first so that they would need to be saved later?
           </p>
           <p>
            -The answer is he wouldn't because God is not retarded. The answer is that jesus is not God.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             jesus needed to sacrifice himself by getting stabbed by the wrists and ankles into a piece of wood and bleed and starve to death slowly and painfully to save everyone from himself damning them to hell
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            sounds like a satanic ritual to prevent his evil side from taking over
           </p>
           <p>
            -If jesus wanted them to be saved from hell by believing in him, then why didn't he just not exist in the first place so that nobody would have to believe unless they get sent to hell? jesus made himself exist around some really strange circumstances that guaranteed a huge amount of people wouldn't believe in him, so that he could send them to hell forever when he could have simply just never existed so that nobody would go to hell for not believing in him, but he chose to damn billions of people to hell for all eternity anyway. That's not god. That's satan pretending to be god.
           </p>
           <p>
            -He's the SON OF MAN, don't you get it? He's the creation of mankind, not of God. God made humanity, not the other way around. jesus is literally satan and total blasphemy
           </p>
           <p>
            jesus is satan.

            that is when I decided that religion is against god.
           </p>
           <p>
            God and religion are not the same thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            religion demands that you beLIEve but never allows you to KNOW.
           </p>
           <p>
            people fall into the trap of worshipping their religion and forgetting about god entirely.

             -Jesus wanted everyone to be saved
            </p>
            <p>
             Jesus didn’t die for everyone, He died for the elect. His sheep hear his voice.

            <p>
             Some vessels have been prepared for honorable uses, some for dishonorable. Heaven and hell both glorify God.

            <p>
             -Why is there still sin?
            </p>
            <p>
             The world is still broken. We are all still born in the sin of Adam.
            </p>
            <p>
             But. Through repentance and following in Jesus our sins are forgiven. Jesus’ death doesn’t mean much to those who don’t believe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The world will be purged in the second coming.
            </p>
            <p>
             -Jesus for some reason had to die a bloody death
            </p>
            <p>
             Death is the power of sin. Wages of sin = death. Jesus resurrecting from a death He didn’t deserve shows that death and sin have no power over Him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, it’s God showing His faithfulness in not requiring Abraham’s son, but instead offering Jesus, His son as sacrifice.

              All I can say is try to be a good person by your own standards (don't fall for other peoples approval or disapproval of you because they seek to control you and limit you and be your master)
             </p>
             <p>
              Always try to do what you think would make God proud of you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Always question everyone and everything, and you will know who or what you are not allowed to question, and likely who "thinks" they're in charge.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just try to treat others the way you want to be treated whenever possible to the best of your ability and generally don't be a dick.
             </p>
             <p>
              You do these things, and chances are you're already on track to being a better person and being closer to GOD than most people who obsessively follow a religion and worship it like as if the religion itself is their false god.

             What you’re missing is the belief in absolute right and wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your joke is flawed.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would make more sense if Jesus said something like this:
            </p>
            <p>
             “If you engage in this harmful behavior you will be punished”
            </p>
            <p>
             Rather then
            </p>
            <p>
             “Let me in”
            </p>
            <p>
             Religion promises punishment to harmful behaviors; if followed there would be less damage in the universe. It also promises reward to fruitful behaviors; if followed there would be more good in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             It boils down to whether you believe in absolute right and wrong which any sane person does.

              Nothing is that simple here on earth. I will say there are definitely gray areas, but I will agree with you in that there DEFINITELY ARE ABSOLUTES. They DO exist, and I have witnessed true good, and I have witnessed the darkest most vile and unnameable evil.

              My joke is not flawed, You misunderstand my joke. lots of different christians run around telling people "believe in jesus, here come to us and be in our group, but by the way, if you don't, you're going to hell forever and ever even if you're a good person!, oh and by the way jesus loves you, even though he's sending you to hell! k thanks bai"

                Was that supposed to be some kind of defense mechanism designed to make me look bad somehow? Because it doesn't. You know what would? An intelligent response addressing the factual content of my post. But that isn't possible, because everything I said is true and you know it.
               </p>
               <p>
                But you don't like hearing it, so you react by name calling or using semantic stop-sign themed buzzwords in an attempt to pathetically censor any logical debate or discussion or response that could have possibly come out from all of this, because it is logic itself, that is feared by the illogical.

                  You don't like what I said because you disagree with it, but since you don't have an argument, you're just using a buzzword like strawman to try to shut me down and get me to give up, but calling out "strawman!" isn't an argument when you can't even prove that there is a strawman in the first place. That's like I'm losing an argument so I just say "Hey you're a lizard lol I win the argument"

               You’re super retarded. Everything is subjective. The most illuminated of the Illuminati a hundred years ago are by and large more retarded than an average 14 year old with the internet in modern times. True good is absolute evil to the other side of the coin. Stop with your armchair philosophy retard, read the Bible and highlight the words of Jesus as you read it.

              You have to be incredibly honest with GOD, but you also have to be incredibly honest with yourself. You have to have a pure and innocent and unbreakable desire to know GOD, to know the truth and love GOD. You have to WANT IT. If you don't feel yourself wanting it for some odd reason, you have to WANT to WANT it. You have to sincerely and honestly with the most innocence and purity in your soul, just from the depths of your very being scream out to GOD with your soul. "GOD PLEASE HELP ME FIND THE TRUTH, PLEASE GUIDE ME TO YOU"
             </p>
             <p>
              and you have to be patient, and you have to listen, listen with your soul in ways that go beyond your normal senses. You have to let go of false limitations in your mind and be willing to hear the answer, because it will come in many forms that you will miss if you're not paying attention. Form a relationship with GOD. Try to feel GOD guiding you towards good goals, and away from bad things. It gets extremely complicated and overwhelming, so sometimes you have to just stop and breath and ask GOD to guide you again if you're too confused. It's not always perfectly clear, but how you react to the message is usually what GOD intended anyway. Obviously don't do anything dangerous or illegal. When your mind interprets a message as something bad, it's because your subconscious is clouding up your judgment with garbage. Just breath and start over. Eventually you can feel disturbances in the force like in star wars, and you get better and better at communicating with GOD and making better and better choices.

                You're making a mistake of assuming that God and religion are the same thing, They are not. Forget religion. I'm saying just "GOD" the one and only GOD that is beyond all measure and all limitations, omnipotent and omnipresent and even beyond that, and beyond all flawed religions. religion is irrelevant. GOD IS GOD.

                      GOD is greater than we could ever imagine or perceive. We can't even get an accurate idea of what GOD looks like from this current stage of perception. But I will say, GOD is mindblowingly perfect, and even beyond perfect.

               Well I am definitely thinking jesus is satan but for reasons I found when I read the Bible.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the book of revelation jesus refers to himself as the bright morning star. This is a name for Satan in the old testament.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bible states that the evil one deceives the whole world. Christianity is the most popular religion on earth followed by Islam. As you probably know the 3 semitic faiths worship the same god.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bible also says that anything that is super popular in the world is evil.
              </p>
              <p>
               Jesus states that no one is good not even him.
              </p>
              <p>

                The term ‘lucifer’/‘morning star’ in Isaiah 14:12 is a substitution based on a guess by the translator Eusebius, and has no basis in the underlying text.
               </p>
               <p>
                The word in the hebrew is ‘הילל’ and it appears only once in scripture.
               </p>
               <p>
                A good alliteration would be ‘heylel’, and a good translation would be: ‘son of the shining/howling morning’.

                 Evil one deceives the world. Revelation 12-9.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anything popular is evil. 1st John 2-15 and 1st John 4-5
                </p>
                <p>
                 Jesus says no one is good. Mark 10-18
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lucifer is gods 1st and favourite and jesus has been with god since the beginning.  Job 1-6, Job 2-1, Ezekiel 28-12:19, 1st Peter 1-20 to 21, and John 1- to 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Blood sacrifice of nations and foreskins. Genesis 17- 9to 14, 1st Samuel 15- 3to 11, Judges 11- 30 to 40, Exodus 4- 22to 26, Exodus 11- 4to 7, and Exodus 12- 29 and 30. There's a lot more, almost the entire old testament is a bloodbath.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The whole world will worship the beast. Revelation 13-8
                </p>
                <p>
                 The whole world will turn against Israel.  Zechariah 12-3. Honestly I reccomend reading the entire book of zechariah, its the last book in the old testament. Very interesting stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you can manage to read the whole bible you will find many things that will suprise you. Its honestly shocking.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyway I hope this helps.

                  This is amazing, thank you so much. I have read the whole bible a few times but sometimes things don't "POP out" like they SHOULD, if the thing was written or translated properly. It's like these things are just sort of hidden between the lines, so maybe it was written properly and maybe being sneaky was the intention.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is extremely helpful, thank you SO MUCH!

                      Well, I mean, I get what you mean. But I honestly believe that the bible (and the people that wrote it) intentionally try to misrepresent GOD on purpose because they want to make it seem like GOD has to "stick" to the way they falsely portray god in the bible because they want to trick people into thinking that God is bad. Essentially they make people believe that religion and god are the same thing, but then they turn people away from religion by making it really bad, but then in the process people get MK Ultra'd and throw the baby out with the bathwater so to speak, and start to dislike god as much as they dislike religion. I know that GOD is actually a really good bro and I love GOD, but I know that GOD is better than their propaganda.

                      Yea it's like there were some good and bad people that both had their chances to write things in the bible, like good vs evil trying to both convince the person reading to go one way or the other. I also find it incredibly interesting that the bible warns people to not make false likenesses of heaven on earth and to not make false images in the name of God, but meanwhile the bible seems to have no problem making an "image" of God by deciding for the reader how they shall perceive God as a result of what they read from what was presented to them in the bible. You're basically told "Don't make false idols!" but religion and the bible, and other books are themselves essentially the false idols we are warned about, which is a huge contradiction and totally mind blowing.

                      But why would he right? My theory is that jesus and satan are the same person, but like they're schizophrenic split personalities and jesus is always fighting his evil half from taking over, which sometimes happens like dr jekyl and mr hyde.

                      It is pretty freaky, but I don't believe that the bible does a good job at representing the one true actual real GOD, and it never could because the bible and all religion are imperfect because they are made by imperfect human beings making an imperfect interpretation of the perfect (divine), but always failing to, or even intentionally putting in bad things to mislead good people.

                       I'd have to look up the year but want to say 1500s or 1600s. A bunch of Bible scholars took all the Christian scriptures and decided what to keep and what to throw out.  There is a gospel of Thomas a gospel of Mary and even one by Judas. There is a collection of works called the apocrypha. The catholic bible has books protestants don't have.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There were several different versions of each book to and it had to be decided which ones were correct.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I do want to say that I am no atheist. I am a pagan now. Reason being that all pagan faiths are telling the same basic story, part of that story is in the Bible.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I believe that whatever god is communicated with all nations in ways they could understand. No one nation is "chosen". I believe that to understand god you just have look at nature.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There is a hierarchy. And you see this in human families, lions, wolves, everything.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I believe that god wants you and me and everyone else to wonder about these things.

            Certainly a traditional Catholic is not going to think his faith is of equal worth to Protestantism, or that a Protestant is just as likely to receive salvation as he is. If he believed they provided equal means to salvation he probably wouldn't be a Catholic. But if we're discussing racial equality, and we usually are when equality is mentioned on Voat, a black Catholic is equally eligible to salvation as any Catholic. And in a Catholic's eyes, likely more than a white Protestant.
           </p>
           <p>
            But no, religion does not really teach equality in its essence. Certainly not the Semitic religions. Muslims certainly do not believe non-Muslims are equal to non-Muslims, for example, in any really important sense - certainly in matters of the spirit, but even in matters temporal.

                It's an ok quote. Good for conversation certainly. I'm unsure it tells us much that is important though. Certainly if one is a racialist.
                <em>
                 Within
                </em>
                Christianity, or within the various brands of Christianity, there is equality in spiritual matters, which unsurprisingly has been used to assist arguments for racial equality.

                 "You now are a part of the body of Christ and a member in particular." Favorite verse because it highlights our cohesive equality in Christ as well as our importance as a unique individual.

                   Yeah, I know, verses have context. It's my favorite verse... Pretty sure I said that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   All people are invited to become a part of the body of Christ. The Church of Christ is the body of believers themselves, not the religious organizations attempting to profit from them by seeking tax exemptions, only saying PC garbage in public and catering to pop music fans who sing blasphemous lyrics unwittingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Equality is equal opportunity, not equal outcome. Christians who think they can determine now whether a person is going to be saved when they die are the most ignorant of all. You're not more deserving of salvation than Hillary Clinton or George Soros. You might receive it, but not because you deserve it. But you just keep on thinkin' you're God's special boy on the inside. I'm sure that makes you so effective at reaching out to people, holding onto a holier than thou attitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   According to what do you believe in hell? Because as far as I can tell, there is never a single mention in the Bible of any human going to hell.

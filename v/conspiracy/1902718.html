           When we develop an understanding in an area of knowledge, some people will try to connect that knowledge back with the rest of their knowledge.

           Don't quarantine parts of your mind from other parts. The universe is one object, and so should be your mind. If we want a deeper understanding, we must unify instead of quarantine. Do not compartmentalize your own mind, lest bad compartments be allowed to exist without your full awareness.

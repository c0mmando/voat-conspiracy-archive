<p>Hello everyone. I\'m Mumberthrax, and four days ago Atko responded to <a href="https://voat.co/v/subverserequest/comments/88335">my post on subverserequest</a> and made me a level 1 moderator on <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">/v/conspiracy</a>. In that process <a href="https://voat.co/user/fenixrisin">@fenixrisin</a> was removed as a moderator, but I\'ve sent him a message inviting him to return if he wishes. Level 1 moderator just means that in addition to normal moderator abilities, I can add and remove other moderators, all of whom are necessarily level 2.</p>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
<p>I think that a brief statement about my beliefs and intentions regarding moderation would be in order, so I\'ll do that here: I believe that a moderator role is that of a public servant; those who volunteer are responsible for attending to the needs of the community they moderate, for facilitating the growth of that community and helping them to succeed in their collective aspirations. Moderators alone are not the only who may adopt these responsibilities, and because the abilities moderators have to change the appearance and functionality of a subverse is substantial, they are perhaps more crucially charged with that responsibility than others.</p>
<p>I believe that <em>ideally</em> a moderator should be more than a human spam filter. I believe that through stickying posts, managing the sidebar, and facilitating meaningful discussions, a moderator can use his or her abilities to aid a community actively. Sometimes it\'s fine to have mods that just filter out spam or other little things - every little bit helps, and if there isn\'t an apparent need for more activity than that then it\'s perfectly appropriate.</p>
<p>So bearing that set of beliefs in mind, my intentions are to try to help make this subverse the best hub it can be for sharing and discussing conspiracy theories and piecing together the truth. I like conspiracy theories, and try to keep an open mind about most things. I get paranoid sometimes, and occasionally i have to take breaks from conspiracy theory stuff when I get overwhelmed. I also try to remain skeptical, to try to weed out the fake stuff and hyperbole. You won\'t see me actively advocating for hollow earth theories, but until we send cameras down hundreds of miles into the earth I\'ll not discount it entirely.</p>
<h4>Past experience and qualifications</h4>
<p>I\'ve had a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mumberthrax/">reddit account</a> for around 5 years now, been on voat for about 3.5 months. On reddit I have moderated a few subreddits, but I\'ve usually been fairly laissez-faire (read: lazy) about managing them. The ones I am top mod of which are active, I mostly stay around on them as an insurance policy against misconduct or disaster. The little experimental ones I do absolutely nothing with.</p>
<p>I used to be a moderator and later a server administrator at <a href="https://nerd.nu">nerd.nu</a> ( <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/mcpublic">/r/mcpublic</a> ), the Reddit Minecraft Servers. I was not a great admin, but I like to think I tried to do good. I certainly developed experience dealing with bureaucracy, trolls/harassment, and a bit of public relations - all of which I hope has helped me to grow into a more useful person.</p>
<p>My most recent moderate success has been the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/publicmodlogs/">publicmodlogs account on reddit</a>, which provides subreddit moderators a very easy way to publish their moderation logs without requiring a third party website - and just yesterday was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37mszx/your_voice_is_heard/">voted in by the community</a> of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Many thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/go1dfish">@go1dfish</a> for doing the lions share of the work on that project.</p>
<h1>What about the other mods?</h1>
<p>Right now I don\'t intend on changing anything up with the moderator lineup. I suggested in my <a href="https://voat.co/v/subverserequest/comments/88335">subverserequest post</a> (around 24 days ago) that the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mods should stick to their subreddit and let voat regulars handle things here, but since then I\'ve reviewed some old discussions and realized that that attitude might have been hasty to adopt. While I don\'t approve of some of the ways the mods on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> do things over there, and while I do value and respect them for many of their other actions, it should be the community that decides who handles the responsibilities and abilities of moderation. To that end, I\'ll work on facilitating discussions on this matter in the near future.</p>
<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<p>Now that that introduction is over, I\'d like to share a few things I\'m working on currently. </p>
<p>I want to engage everyone here and see what we all want for this subverse. Around 18 days ago I made a <a href="https://voat.co/v/Conspiracy/comments/90719">brainstorming post</a> seeking ideas and suggestions for how we can make <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">/v/conspiracy</a> excellent, and about 4 days ago when I was modded I stickied it so that those who missed it were be able to participate.</p>
<p>I intend on going through the suggestions offered, and creating a new post in the near future to aggregate the ideas and prompt some fresh discussion and development of some of the ideas more.</p>
<p>I\'ve recently gone through and created <a href="https://voat.co/v/ConspiracyMeta/comments/102016">a list of every post I could find</a> in <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">/v/conspiracy</a> that relate to the sub, its community, or other tangentially related meta-topics. In order to keep this meta-stuff organized and in an easy-to-access place, I created <a href="https://voat.co/v/ConspiracyMeta">/v/ConspiracyMeta</a> and posted the list there. I think having a space dedicated purely to improving the subverse and community can be a useful tool for us. Anyone is welcome to post there if it relates to the <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">/v/conspiracy</a> subverse or community.</p>
<p>In reviewing the meta-discussions I collected into that list, I saw a few discussions about moderators where opinions differed on who should be mods and how they should be selected. I intend on creating a post in the near future to see what everyone currently thinks about those issues, how everyone feels, and what we\'d like to see happen.</p>
<p>Since this post is getting rather long, the last thing I\'ll mention for now is that I\'m attempting to keep a <a href="https://voat.co/v/ConspiracyMeta/comments/102624">manually-updated log of my actions</a> as a moderator of <a href="https://voat.co/v/conspiracy">/v/conspiracy</a>. This is kind of experimental for me, but I\'ll try and stick to it. Hopefully it will be of value to someone - at the very least maybe it will be of value to me as I try to improve myself.</p>
<h1>Tl;dr I\'m the new mod, I\'ll try to be good. Stay tuned.</h1>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks for reading. If you skipped to the bottom, that\'s cool too (sorry for the wall of text... I still need to learn the art of brevity). I hope that you guys find me useful. If everyone consistently hates me then I\'ll step down, but I\'d like to be here to help all of us make this sub excellent if you\'ll have me.</p>',

            Do you have any particular preferences regarding the look and feel of the subverse? Are there any specific elements of the current CSS that you think desperately ought to change, or is it more a general overall lack of appeal?

            No, not really. I am willing to learn though if the community feels it would be beneficial. I think I could probably become competent with some deliberate study and practice. I'm also willing to add others who
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            competent with CSS as moderators.

            Stick to those principles and keep an open communication with the community so they can kick any fledgling megalomania right to the curb and you'll be a great mod.

             I'll try to do what I can. I know that I have character flaws which make me less than ideal to lead or manage any group or community. If I or we can find ways to prevent those from causing harmful disruptions, then I'll be glad.

             Yes voat (just like reddit) currently only permits one post to be stickied at a time. However it may be possible to use CSS to cause multiple links/posts to be prominently displayed on the front page of the subverse. If this is desired, we can look into it.

             Is it healthy for anyone to moderate 15 subverses? You could do a great job, I don't know, but how do you find the time?!

              I think that it depends on how active the subverse/subreddits are, how many other mods there are on the sub, and what sort of work the moderator is expected to perform or what purpose the sub is intended to serve. It looks like less than half of axolotl's subreddits are active to any notable degree, and most seem to be niche or spinoffs from

             I hope that you can understand why I made the subverse request instead of messaging you or the other mods directly prior. As voat picks up more activity, it seemed that the sub is at a critical stage where it could either become a clone of
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             , become worse, or it could become its own thing and excel. I intend no disrespect to you or the other mods through this.

              I really don't understand the backdoor route into modship.  I also don't understand how someone could message Atko about this sub and just take over without any communication between the current mods.  I've been here for almost a year, i visit on a daily basis.  I would have liked to be involved in a conversation at the very least.  I for one think it's shady, I personally have no idea who you are and don't agree with your reasoning behind sneaking into level 2 modship here.

               Why didn't you make the request yourself? It was there out in the open? Obviously no-one was interested in it, not the mods, not users of this subverse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Should he have contacted the mods? Maybe. But then again, who knows how long it would've taken them to reply and come to a decision? It is not as if they didn't have the time to solve this themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               Besides, what's he gonna do? We can always have him removed if he misbehaves.

                Why would I request a sub that I am already part of?  In active subverses, if a request is made to take a sub over a PM should be sent to current moderators.

               <p>
                I guess I just expected common sense out of Atko.

                 No, it is your expectation that a pm should be sent. Perhaps others share the sentiment. That is quite different from common sense. Though it is a common mistake to confuse our values and expectations with a general common sense.

                  Ok, so common sense says anyone can go to request a subverse, and walk away with lead modship with zero communication even though other mods have been doing the job for a year.  Makes sense

               has been a thing for a while. You made a post on
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiratard">
                /v/conspiratard
               </a>
               (
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/Conspiratard/comments/46497">
                link
               </a>
               ) even acknowledging that there is an application process to be given ownership of a subverse. Atko previously made a comment (on a post near the top of the front page of this sub) which i cited in my subverse request about how this subverse was eligible for request.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think I explained the gist of my reasoning for this in my comment on that subverserequest post:
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/subverserequest/comments/88335/152638">
                https://voat.co/v/subverserequest/comments/88335/152638
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               It's true that it may have been the courteous thing to have messaged the current mods before making the subverse request. I suppose I had a personal bias in that I believed I would be a better person for the job, and a concern based on comments here and on reddit that some of the mods may not have the best interests of the community at heart - which is one of the big reasons so many of us left reddit for voat, due to corrupt mods.
              </p>
              <p>
               I understand that there's no way that I can prove to you my sincerity or intentions through words, so the best that I can ask for is to be judged by my actions as moderator. If on the balance of things the community consistently wishes me to be gone, then I will step down. My actions should be visible via the moderation log, and through the log I have been and intend on updating with any notable actions I take as a mod here.

                1 - you don't request a subverse that is active.  I don't care if the main guy is gone, it makes no sense to try to take it over.  I know there's a process to do it, and I know I posted about it.  Those are abandoned subverses with no other mods.  Not one of the most active on this website with active mods already in place.  If Atko or the active mods here had an issue, it should have been up to us to resolve it.  I wouldn't have an issue if he just installed new level 1 mods.  My issue is making a new user a level 2 while the mopes that have been here for a year don't even get notified.

                2 - I've been here almost a year.  A daily user for the most part.  I was never a mod on reddit and I had the same concerns you did, which is why i'm here.
               </h1>
               <h1 id="md-even-after-you-took-over-you-never-pmd-anyone-you-just-tossed-a-sticky-up.">
                3 - Even after you took over, you never PMd anyone you just tossed a sticky up.
               </h1>
               <p>
                Trying to prove yourself is going to be hard now, just by the way you approached it.  And I fault Atko just as much.  I realize he's a busy guy but giving away subverses just because the creator is gone is not the way to do things.  And this isn't the first time he's done it.  I was a mod of
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/gaming">
                 /v/gaming
                </a>
                for 7 months only to wake up one day to all mods stripped and one installed.

            Yes, I'd very much like for this subverse to govern itself; no outside influence from
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            moderators.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Perhaps community-chosen mods could moderate this sub? Right now we've just got a few people from
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy

             While i was looking through some of
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/ConspiracyMeta/comments/102016">
              the old posts
             </a>
             i saw where many of the current mods were mentioned or suggested. The people in those posts seemed supportive of them, and fenixrisin added just about all the names which were brought up. I can go back and pull those out later on just for historical context.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know for certain that having
             <em>
              no
             </em>
             mods from
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             is best necessarily, and i can definitely understand and appreciate the sentiment since i felt that way previously. I do think
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
              /r/conspiracy
             </a>
             could be better in some ways, and I also think they're way better than they were in ages past so it isn't as though the mod team over there is wholly bad or incompetent by any means. I'm hopeful that we can have a very good and open community discussion on the subject though, weighing pros and cons of different processes for picking mods and what they should be doing. I hate to spend
             <em>
              too
             </em>
             much time about minutiae and create a lot of meta-drama, but it's important stuff and it's a topic that hasn't really been solidly addressed.

              mods are good, we must remain free on here. Have as little mods as possible to reduce the meta drama.

              Also, there are many faults with the current mods you won't hear about because the complaints get downvoted by them.

               Well I and I'm sure the rest of the community would appreciate hearing about those complaints - logical argument is more important to me than votes in such matters. If you've got any links, or have heard of anything in particular even if you don't recall the source, I think it would be appropriate to share. I don't intend on censoring it - and I'm not certain but I

            I like the idea of compiling a list of links that are related to the sub.  Once a week people or moderators should vote on really good links and topics.  Something to engage the community.  An on-going list of links with sources and videos that back up the information given.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also would really like to see conspiracy folks publishing their own news right here on Voat.

             I like that idea too, and having a weekly thing like that could be good. I think after a day or so I'll unsticky this post and replace it with an updated brainstorming post, and i'll be sure to include your idea there. I'm kind of picturing a situation where we see which ideas/suggestions/projects seem to be the most appealing to folks, and focus attention on developing those individually first.
            </p>
            <p>
             Would you be willing to elaborate a bit more on people here publishing their own news on voat? I'm not sure that I understand entirely.

              Well I've seen great posts before in conspiracy where they covered all their bases and showed all their sources.  One person would say:  "want to know more"  and post a gazillion links.  His post were nice and very informative but I'm thinking have articles with interviews with actual people involved  that's easier to read and have all the facts right there in your face.  Basically a 'official' conspiracy news article written by someone who really knows their shit and interviews people involved  but also vetted by the local conspiracy admins so no BS get's published as 'official".

               Ah yes, -moose- and his other account back before (I don't remember what the name was). They'd always post great lists of relevant links.
              </p>
              <p>
               Right on, I think that sounds pretty much exactly what I'd like to see too. People putting things together on their own and discussing these things rather than
               <em>
                just
               </em>
               posting links to news articles or videos.

              <p>
               A little while back there was some discussion on
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/c_s_t">
                /r/c_s_t
               </a>
               about an idea sort of similar to this. They wanted to create some "zines", which were sort of overviews of various conspiracy theories.
               <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/32fwkc/suggestion_theories_series/">

               Could be somewhat relevant.

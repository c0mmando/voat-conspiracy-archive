            It's generated by software that auto-writes the articles based on a larger collection of texts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The repetition happens because the algorithm, usually based on markov chains, has no semantic understanding of what the text actually says, it just knows the words in a specific sequence achieve a higher score and can sometimes repeat them as a way to meet the minimum score requirements the human operator imposes.

            Pay close attention to facebook feeds, much of the churn there is auto generated.

            Right, because the influence of outside empires and industrialists have had no influence on their societies.  Nor the significant agricultural differences.  Access to resources and even basic nutrition or clean water.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have to separate circumstance from the situation if you want objectively verify the genetic differences.  Not to mention the actual studies to indicate that income disparity is one of the greatest causes of social problems, possibly the only reliably traceable one.  We can of course ignore history, economics, education and nutrition if you want but that would be stupid.

            What role does nutrition play?  What role does nutrition play in that of the mother and the fetus, or the development of an adolescent?  We know from various studies that behavior improves with better diet and so does educational performance and that's after the person is fully formed.  Should we be able to trace back to the mother herself we might find the importance of specific nutrition there as well.  Sure, there's a genetic difference in producing smarter or dumber people I'm willing to buy in to that but if the best we can do is test populations and we can't verify specific markers in the genetic code I'm not sure there's ready proof.  And generally this doesn't seem like the kind of hard science I'd be willing to back an argument with myself.  It's certainly not without it's valid criticisms.

            I agree - but reddit timed it perfectly so that they purged those they didn't want, most of whom seem genuinely racist.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the difference between racist and race-realist, i fail to see any distinguishing difference.  There is absolutely nothing about the color of ones skin that determines their behavior.  It's entirely dependent on upbringing, socio-economic status, education, parents, and a litany of other factors.  Yes, the ghettos are overwhelmingly black.  Yes, there is a lot of crime out of those areas.  It's not skin color, it's culture.  Having grown up in an area like that, i can attest to the fact that white people, native americans, blacks, asians all fall into it.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes, we are all here because reddit started sucking dick, but what I've seen over the last few weeks is an overwhelmingly racist theme amongst the responses where there used to be good dialogue.

            yeah someone posted an askgoat or whatever asking "Why do people care about how many women work in tech? If they wanted to work in tech they would." I posted a response in direct reply to the question, but most responses were just like "blah blah yeah women are already given an unfair advantage! blsh blah"
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone took the opportunity to whine about women rather than answering the question

            Yeah I'm losing interest. I tried to leave reddit due to the ridiculous SRS shit and general assholism by the admins and circlejerk community, but.....
           </p>
           <p>
            voat just seems so negative lately. everything is either straight up negativity, or just whining about "censorship"
           </p>
           <p>
            At the beginning it has a fuzzy feeling of a bunch of people trying to start a healthy alternative. Now it just feels like a XYZchan full of angry people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus I lean towards center-left, and things feel pretty damn right wing around here too
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like it started with people going "hey reddit sucksm let's create a better reddit where we can be full of all the hatred at Reddit!" (hatred by mods etc. Then as time passed it became people saying "hey reddit is banning hate topics, let's create a website where hate topics can flourish!" and it become a circlejerk of negative people
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't get me wrong, I'm perfectly fine with the so-called "hate" subreddits

            I think part of it is that the sort of passion you get at either extreme just isn't something you see about moderate viewpoints. No one I've ever seen, is a neutral zealot. that kind of energy trends naturally towards the extremes.

            Its probably an army of trolls paid for by reddit. Don't worry about it.. It will calm down after boats been in the news a s a hate site.
Besides.. If you want real freedom of speach then remove the ability to downvoat, and then allow users to personally block trolls

            A very complicated issue, for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see three ways of dealing with this, for you, the sensitive voater:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Go back to reddit.  Sure, you didn't like all the censorship and corporate shilling, but they were doing it for your own good.  You don't like racism, they're trying to eradicate all racism against minorities.  It's almost like a match made in heaven.  They take away the naughty "n-word" and you get to look at pictures of cats.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Buckle up and enjoy the happening.  This is what the other half thinks, princess.  The world is a nasty place, and when you tell people that they're the rapist, privileged scum of the earth, they react... well, adversely to that.  The internet masters have successfully divided to community.  Watch the show, or turn off the TV. this is the way it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Put down the internet.  You could always, you know: go outside.  If one is too gay and the other is too racist, stop going to any, and interact with normal people who have social filters cause they're out in social spaces.
           </p>
           <p>
            sorry, there is also a fourth option:
           </p>
           <p>
            4)bitch and moan. I mean, why not? Real life is hard and on the internet no one knows your a dog. Complain about the sky being blue and eventually it'll turn orange, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            The internet is all about the extremes. you could always visit one website, get their version of the "facts", then go to the other website and get theirs. There are no more moderate website left, extremes make money. so pick a side or go outside.

              The researchers analysed genetic data and GCSE scores from 12,500 twins, about half of whom were identical.
             </p>
             <p>
              Results in all subjects, including maths, science, art and humanities, were highly heritable, with genes explaining a bigger proportion of the differences between children (54-65%) than environmental factors, such as school and family combined (14-21%), which were shared by the twins.
             </p>
             <p>
              Comparing the outcomes for identical twins with fraternal twins allows scientists to investigate the extent to which genetics influence a person’s life. Identical twins share 100% of their genes, whereas fraternal twins share on average only half of the genes that differ between people.
             </p>
             <p>
              So if genetics were a significant factor governing GCSE results, the differences between fraternal twins’ performances would be expected to be consistently greater than those between identical twins–and this is what the scientists saw.
             </p>
             <p>
              When the scientists factored in IQ scores, they found that intelligence appeared to account for slightly less than half of the genetic component, suggesting that other heritable traits–curiosity, determination and memory, perhaps–play a significant role.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kaili Rimfeld, who led the study and is also at King’s College London, said: “There’s a general academic achievement factor. Children who do well in one subject tend to better in another subject and that is largely for genetic reasons.”

            Thank you for your post. I feel the same way.
           </p>
           <p>
            I frankly believe that reddit has selectively banned communities with the intent of driving the worst of the worst to Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also believe that reddit moderators are currently on Voat, producing and promoting racist content with the intent of shaping Voat's community as the "anti-reddit".
           </p>
           <p>
            Reddit wants voat to be as despicable as it can be, in order to justify the censorship and corporate control of reddit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reddit took over content aggregation from digg because it offered a new interface that wasn't as gameable. The idea that a reddit clone can take over from reddit is misguided at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn't help that registration is closed. This means that we can't shape the community with other influences.

             That way they can say, "See what happens when you have free speech!" Even though things are clearly being manipulated.

            I think it's just a push back from the extreme that Reddit has become.  It will even out as Reddit collapses, so long as Voat is careful about not letting extremists censor everything.

             It seems so immature to use the word fag. But no, I'm not uncomfortable at all with free speech. i just said there was a noticeable shift here, and my conspiracy is that it seems planned and orchestrated to facilitate race wards. Must be working.

              Oh it's orchestrated but the reality is the people in the middle mincing about are playing into the radical left's hands right now. As hard as it is to hear it isn't gonna be jamal tackling the zionist problem it's gonna be jim bob and he probably isn't to fond of colored folk with an aggravated temperament.

              It's coming to a time where sides have got to be picked. the media is forcing a racewar and it could absolutely explode in just a day or two.

            I'm a dirty /all-rat and I haven't had any issues with Voat. There are some extremes as always but practically all of my conversations have been reasonable. Like one about Utah and it's homeless programs, where fiscally conservative meets socially liberal.
           </p>
           <p>
            European refuge immigration discussions vary all over the place, some saying they should go back to their countries and fix their culture, some say they need to leave their country in order to socially progress, and some they simply need to integrate into society instead of creating a self-segregated community.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess, I'm just not seeing the same Voat as you.

            "Neither pure capitalism or pure socialism work well on their own, the bulk of MSM is just sort of lazily researched for a paycheck, green ketchup actually didn't taste weird - it was your perception. THE PUBLIC MUST NOT KNOW." Oh my god, you can't be serious.

            Masturbation might feel nice, but it has never gotten anything productive done - and it certainly doesn't improve relations with people outside of yourself. You don't have to like that racial differences are biological reality; but the weight of evidence is going to come crashing down on our heads sooner or later. The egalitarian rhetoric gets more frantic with every passing year, and there's a reason for that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact of the matter is, the single most important factor for the quality of our societies is IQ - and not every group actually has the same amount of smarts. (YES, IQ tests measure something "real," and no, IQ tests are NOT significantly culturally biased. This is normally the part where I link to an article where an IQ researcher explains that believing otherwise is scientifically illiterate, but I just discovered the site the article is hosted on is temporarily down.
            <a href="https://ideas.aeon.co/viewpoints/stuart-ritchie-on-is-there-anything-to-iq">
             Here's the link anyway
            </a>
            for when it's back up. Wayback can't archive it, unfortunately.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I've said this before, but for whites and East Asians to do ANYTHING but support implementation of eugenic policies for the rest of the peoples of the world - less intellectually blessed by natural evolution - is nothing BUT masturbating over our cognitive superiority. "Oh dear, however can we help these poor people! Oh, hey, Head Start!" Fucking embarrassing.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're a teacher? You should really know the
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Crusade-Education-1967-2014/dp/1593680414">
             history of educational reform
            </a>
            , and the many, many decades of its utter failure to close black-white "achievement gaps." Nothing but "rescue the little black chilluns" masturbation on the part of whites.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because I am a White Nationalist, a race realist, and someone who participates in forums like
            <a href="/v/niggers">
             v/Niggers
            </a>
            , I am frequently accused of "hating" non-white people. I don't hate anyone. I know black people on social media who I talk to every day about this stuff. They agree with us at
            <a href="/v/niggers">
             v/Niggers
            </a>
            - racial differences are biological reality, and social "anti-racist" liberalism is more an exercise for white people to feel better about themselves than it is to "help" anything. It is also a good path to tank Western civilization and to threaten one of the more productive groups of the world - whites - with total demographic replacement. They are perfectly well aware that their people are in BIG TROUBLE without us around because blacks as a whole cannot reproduce the bounty of the West on their own. They also know their people will not implement any eugenics programs on their own - they are dependent on groups like whites forcing the bulk of blacks into it - and that without our help, they will be at the mercy of natural evolution to make them a peoples who can ever go to the moon...or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            They would turn up their nose at your kumbaya-ism. Really what's so "caring" about your position, which leaves the Sun peoples of the world in the mud?

                LOL, are you seriously jumping straight to the suggestion that I was raised a racist and have never known any non-white people? Did my comment really fucking threaten you so much that you aren't even going to engage, but go straight to that? Holy shit, that's pathetic.
               </p>
               <p>
                For the record, I was raised by leftists. I also spent 15 years on the radical left as a semi-Afrocentric "anti-racist" activist, and most of my friends at the time were either black or equally radical whites. I did a 180 for a reason. Believe me, my mind can be changed.

               <p>
                And yeah, it's disgusting that you're marrying a native guy. But from the sounds of it, you're too insistent on being a weak link to be a loss.

                 So then what changed your mind? You should at least tell me. I want the entire story.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not threatened. I don't feel threatened. You have a right to hate whoever you want. You have a right to think my marriage is disgusting.

                 I just think it's really sad that (and here is my teacher in me) that you could look at children and really believe that some children are inferior to others because of their race. I don't know. I guess that's just hard for me to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With that being said, my experience with children (a whole diversity) has shown that not to be the case. In fact, I have not seen 'white' children to be smarter than any other race or even more exceptional.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Still, I'm sure you can link to IQ studies, but there are flaws with those. However, I will say I have been tested and have a high IQ. I'm not sure what I think of the tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As for test scores, there are so many issues with test scores that this wouldn't even become a subject  of race. It would be come something entirely different. But let me tell you this, the test scores are making even the white kids look stupid these days. And they're not.

                  It's a lengthy story; I had to become disillusioned with liberalism first. That story is in my recent comment history. You can pick it to death if you want, I guess. It's not complete, I admit; I get asked to tell the story a lot, and I think I focus on different aspects every time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But ultimately, I changed my mind because I believe the science. Like I said, the idea that g exists and that IQ tests are not biased is accepted science. It is currently believed that genetics account for ~80% of the variation in IQs between people. For the large racial IQ gaps to fall entirely within the 20% that is environmental is simply not plausible to me. Indeed, we have only been able to manipulate environment enough to raise IQ by about 3 points. It's not enough. Transracial adoption studies suggest that all but a few points of the black-white gap in particular are genetic.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many people perceive non-white (and non-Asian) children to be brighter than tests show them to actually be. Arthur Jensen wrote about believing himself that the black children he tested were of normal IQ, and finding their real scores baffling. Only many years of consistent results convinced him his own research was not flawed. We do, after all, have the corroborating evidence that IQ scores are some of the most valid and reliable instruments we have to predict life outcomes. So believe what you want; reality marches on without you.

                  And really, the whole history of the world makes significantly more sense when you understand this. Without that part of the puzzle, the differences in cultural achievement between peoples is puzzling, and require all manner of convoluted rationalizations to explain.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I already explained to you that I don't hate anyone. You are choosing not to believe me, but recognize that's on you.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I think reproductive race-mixing is disgusting for the same reason that I think everything from book-burning to murder is disgusting; you are destroying something unique and special. I have less quarrel with you if you do not have children with your husband, because that is less destructive...more just not actively productive. I do think it's sad that you specifically chose to be with a guy from a peoples already on the verge of extinction.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Finally, your comments about children being "inferior," are a mere appeal to emotion. I think all human life has value, and I find all children quite adorable and precious. But I don't pretend they don't differ in ability on an individual level. How is this different on a group level?

                  The world is simply not fair. It sucks, but ignoring it changes nothing.

                    I don't even know how to reply to this. Your comment seems to be full of assumptions about how I treat people, and I'm largely stuck for an answer without unpacking that.

                   <p>
                    "Racism," to me, means a recognition of racial differences, and a natural, innate preference for your own people. I see nothing wrong with that. Also, it has nothing to do with dignity one way or the other.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Your sped students may not be able to help it; but I'm pretty sure you don't use that as a justification to treat them as if they were GATE students. That would actually be unfair to them, and a waste of your time.

                     I do though. I treat all my students with dignity and respect. Do I teach them the same way? No. But I treat them the same way. I guess I'm asking how you treat people based on their differences.

                     I don't think that's what the common definition of racism means. The problem is, you are only doing half of the racism thing:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So, I agree, perhaps there are characteristics of certain races (perhaps), but I don't agree with the second part. Do you?

                     My Native fiancé is extremely stoic and it is part of his race. However, he is NOT inferior to me.

                      No, frankly, you cannot possibly treat them the same way. You could walk up to a GATE student and ask them for their views on the next election. Would you do that with a Sped student? Doubt it. If you did, would you be expecting to engage them on similar levels? Obviously not.

                      Basically you're just asking, "are you a meanie to people," and I just kind of find that a tiresome question to always be fielding. I honestly feel like I've essentially already answered that in other responses I've already given, e.g.:

                      It's sort of like you have this image of me in a white hood and swastika armband in your head, and nothing I actually SAY can alter the straw image you're picturing. I'm getting pretty used to that, unfortunately - I have run into this a lot. I don't know, is this media brainwashing about what a "racist" is? I will get into conversations with people and seem to be making SOME progress, and then they will suddenly devolve out of the blue into demanding to know why I hate "different skin colors." I will bring them back from that nonsense...and then it will happen again,

Maybe it would help to just not be a faceless username on the internet, because I don't seem to have these issues in person...only online, where people can't see my behaviour or hear my voice talk about this stuff.

                      Since the races are all better at different things, they are "inferior or superior to another race or races" in some respect or another. No race is superior at

                       supreme

                      race. I'm not seeing a requirement for a belief in a

                       supreme
                      </em>

                     <p>
                      Also, belief in a supreme race is rare. I do occasionally meet a person who believes in a supreme race; but those people are fringe kooks even amongst proud racists and nationalists. If that's what's required to be "racist," virtually no one is racist. And clearly, it is still not acceptable even to rank the races on individual attributes. Even around blacks in sports,

                     <p>
                      What you seem to be talking about - whether one race is "inferior" in some gestalt sense because their race ranks low on several attributes we value - is almost a spiritual question, I think, and sort of outside the scope of what race realists talk about. It's basically up to you to decide that.

            The problem is that, like the very majority of our subverse, I actually have moderate political views. I do one thing that voat's «moderates» don't do:
           </p>
           <p>
            I call a spade a spade.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's it. When I hear something like «race is a social construct» or «socioeconomic status», I call people out on that, because this is a red flag of leftist propaganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            That makes me an «extremist», «far-right», «racist white supremacist Nazi». It's up to you to decide whether moderate views are «extreme» for you, but if they are, you're already on the dark side.

             It is true. Every day
             <a href="http://akdart.com/aff8.html">
              black crime
             </a>
             happens and you never hear about it in the main stream media. You never hear about black on black crime either. Why? Black people commit more crime than any other group. It's a fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe Voat reflects this fact by being one of the last bastions of free speech? Maybe stuff like this gets posted because nobody else is talking about it? The mainstream (aka "zionist") media focuses solely on white on black police brutality and white lone wolf shooters.
            </p>
            <p>
             Watch how quickly the news about the recent black gunman who killed the reporters fades away. He doesn't fit the narrative. But, the media will talk about Treyvon Martin and Micheal Brown till the end of time.

            The amount of UK slang and the fact that every website links to UK nationalist party also makes me a bit suspicious. The again next general election is years out. Maybe a organized push of right with groups in Europe in general? Or a false flag operation?

            I feel we're ingrained to think that propaganda will be obvious when we see it.  We don't anticipate the propaganda will appeal to our own beliefs and bias.  We think of it as ridiculous jingoistic posters and blatant preaching, not subversive agreement.  Not cherry-picked news.  Not redacted details.  Not the distraction of network TV which has just been a vehicle for advertising since its inception.  Not radio telling us what to listen to and bombarding us with things to spend money on.  Constant ongoing reinforcement of the life we're expected to live, of consumption and pleasure.  Constantly bringing up stuff we're supposed to spend money on.
           </p>

            Culture was co-opted by advertisement.  The important thing is that the rich stay rich, the consequences, be they racial division or environmental decay are a the result of a society that deifies wealth and power.  "They" are only interested in selling things, whatever gets them to do that is just fine.  Appealing to the lowest common denominator only reinforces it, but it also works for selling!

            I am very scared of this division of races the media is trying to promote. It's all manipulation of the feeble minded. It's all about timing coverage of certain stories in conjunction with others and leaving out the news that needs to be spread. Turn off the TV, get AD blocker, study critical thinking skills, and follow the golden rule.

            As a teacher I believe education systems have failed students too.

            However we should all learn from past mistakes. We allowed the extremism of sjws. We should not promote extremism on the other end too

              censoring would not be seen as a good idea, especially, I don't want this to become reddit 2.0.

             <p>
              At the same time, there is a grey line between their racism, which adds nothing to the conversation and just gets comments that agree with the poster. Then you also have other submissions that are talking about race, but it discusses race, more than it uses racial stereotypes. I think a good parallel would the Boondocks. That show did a good job at depicting problems, prevalent, in the black community. At the same time, they did not seem to do things that were outright racist.
             </p>
             <p>
              We could try making minority subs more active? Make it kind of like the Boondocks, in that we can discuss that race without making it racist. If you get what I am saying. I know this sounded super complicated even now I can't figure out the logistics of it.I guess, I want to see the N-word on the front page when it's used in the friendly term than when it is used in the racist term. "My N-word" vs. "F-ing N-word"

            You mention a few different things you see here that you don't like. Let me try and help analyze.
           </p>
           <p>
            Downvotes: Though you don't care, you brought it up. My observation: the majority opinion is that downvoting is mean, and should be reserved for spam. I personally disagree, that it hides non-interesting content, which is what I browse for- not to give everyone an equal voice, no matter how little I want to read it. I do get the impression that voaters will up/downvote if the opinion of the post conveys an agreeable/disagreeable opinion without regard to its merits, but that will always happen a little.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racism: It's mostly limited to certain subverses. But yes, it is here. I don't personally feel it's necessary to change how it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other views: Of course a site like this has a hivemind. Just like reddit.
           </p>
           <p>
            News: You beg the question. Politics should go to
            <a href="/v/politics">
             v/politics
            </a>
            ! Not being moderate seems to me testament that sensationalism is still what draws a click for a vote. Trouble here is, if the mods were to try wrangling down bad content it would be "censorship."
           </p>
           <p>
            They: You mean vote manipulation? Users on reddit posted video of their new comments being downvoted by bots within seconds of posting. I went into your comment history, and I see no reason to believe that you are being persecuted. Don't take it personally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your comment history: The vast majority of your posts have 0 downvotes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are links to every post of yours that has less than 0 votes from the past month/10 pages of your comments, with my editorialism.

            You did make other comments that had more than five downvotes with net positive upvotes. I would have to agree that your comments were controversial at best; that the votes reflected that accurately.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "single-downvote" comments you made were in a thread similar to this, where someone else was asking for an example of the complaint you made about voat. You started a self post, but had no examples to give.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I read through your posts and comments, I realize you are making up controversy and being divisive yourself. It is complaining, plain and simple. Be the change you want to see by voting up/down and...

              I am concerned because posts like this are practically by definition shitposts. Complaining about shitposting is still shitposting.

                I see a lot of discussion with no recommendations for solution. Even the problem is not concretely laid out by any poster.

                I hope to add to the conversation, by repeating that voting is one tool of change, another is posting quality content. I argue that you should see this thread as a distraction from making the site a bastion of interesting and educational content.

            No. I'm going to downvoat you (check my comment history, I don't do this often) to prove a point. Free speech is to be protected at all costs. It levels the playing field, so that all people are able to work out their opinions, ideas and differences.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we need to remind each other of, with downvoats and scathing condemnation (such as
            <em>
             this
            </em>
            ), is that
            <em>
             absolute free speech, within the bounds of the law, does not mean absolute anarchy.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            We can have unrestricted free speech,
            <em>
             while still being civil to one another
            </em>
            . This needs to be the message we drill in to everyone's heads.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a place for all, here, as long as you contribute in a useful manner. Your defeatist attitude
            <em>
             is in and of itself
            </em>
            what will destroy voat if we let "them".
           </p>
           <p>
            We're at a crossroads in this community, and it could go either way with our actions. Don't let them win.
           </p>
           <p>
            We could be "The Pirate Bay of free speech" if done correctly. If you're the type to get frustrated and quit at the first sign of resistance, then
            <em>
             damn
            </em>
            . You need to reevaluate your life choices.

            I'm tired of pc stuff too. I just think it's way more complex than race. To simplify things to just race is extreme, and a scary one.

            I brought up the idea of the circlejerk because I too think we can have voat without moderators
           </p>
           <p>
            Fat people hate can exist with moderating comments. After all, we're literally commenting on screenshots of comments anyway... why let let the spores of idiocy flourish and be mocked locally?

            - moderation is bad. Say it with me, auf deutsch oder vielleicht Valais?
           </p>
           <p>
            Spam control: Good
           </p>
           <p>
            Thought control: Bad
           </p>
           <p>
            AAAAAANNNNNYYYYYY fucking moderation is pretty fucking hard to justify. Even if I write something like "all whites are nigger and all jews should be rulers of the universe" or something shit like that, it deserves to stand.

              There was quite a long discussion on it the other day, people seem to have the idea that you're in a battle online, I am making points on both sides to explore the issues - devil's advocate or otherwise, to ask can we run FPH without moderation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I then ask what's good about SRS moderation v FPH moderation and can we justify one against the other?
             </p>
             <p>
              SRS - anti-think bullshit fuckwits, grants, delete shit.
             </p>
             <p>
              FPH: noble humanists taking the species forward at the precipice of technology and understanding for a brave new glorious future - I get that, but the means are the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I wonder. Anyway, the discussion went south because, rule #1: 99% of people are abject morons (rule #1.1 there is an overlap of dog IQs and human IQs, that isn't a joke, merely a fact) but still.

            You had bad experiences with certain races so you do anything to justify your racism as an adult.
           </p>

            It's easier that way. I get it.

            I try. It is really difficult for a few reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            For one most people don't even like leaving the comfort of their homes anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second people are so divided and it is difficult to find people with similar views.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many are apathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm left with a small group of people (maybe) that are fearful or feel it is hopeless to actually change things.

             Deleted some stuff. And most of all of my post history was before this influx of current users.
I stopped posting as much recently.
            </p>
            <p>
             Im not freaking out about downvotes. I don't care really about those. I just saw a shift and I wanted to talk about it.

              is bloating out both. I do think this is more of a loud minority thing though. People are too slow to downvoat things is more the problem. It's up to the users of a sub to decide what reaches the top. I only didn't see why you'd say everything you post is getting downvoated.

            If you feel this is not a bigger problem out in the real world then you need to turn off your machine and venture out into the world. The problem your saying exists here is ten times worse out in reality where this stuff leads to senseless violence and destruction. I think we all need to improve the real world and places like this will follow since it's user's that dictate what is here, and users come from the real world. All of this being offended is designed to keep us here arguing instead of making real change in the real world. Quit letting the distractions achieve their goals. Be the change you want to see in the world and encourage those your close to, to do the same. To quote John Lennon, "You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one".

             But can one argue that our reality is not virtual? Don't people now spend most of their time with some form of technology ?

             I believe in the power of writing. One way I enjoy 'changing' or challenging things is discussion. That is why I posted here.

              Not arguing your point, was just trying to point out that we can't expect our words to change everyone to our viewpoints and need to have less weight in faceless words and more weight in physical actions which can influence people stronger than written words. Even spoken word can have a larger impact than written words. And please don't feel that I'm not in agreeing with your original post, just trying to provide an alternative view to it. We can't have freedom of speech if you can't except that some people are going to have barbaric and different views than you. If you want your freedom you need to respect others freedom and learn to surround yourself with people who share your views and not those you don't like or agree with. If you believe control is the answer to not being offended, maybe you should ask the people from the former USSR how that worked out. The price of freedom is more than just the lives of young people.

            Well that's why I posted on conspiracy.

           <p>
            I just feel we should do everything we can to prevent this from becoming another Reddit. If my post gets people to think about some of the issues here than that's a start.

            Your logic is flawed. Why are kids having kids? Why are there single parent homes? All of these things are more likely to occur in impoverished areas. Why is there poverty? There is a class system in our society.
           </p>
           <p>
            You will find that black poor people are similar to white poor people and native poor people and Latino poor people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are they exactly identical? No. There are obviously cultural differences.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been thousands of sociological studies done on poverty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Social stratification? It exists.

             This might be the problem. To use the lingo of Riff-Raff (ugh), default subs are "middle of the mall shit"... and they attract people who use metaphors about malls. It's bound to be more about posturing than communicating. You get that in the tail end of comment threads in backwater subs.

            I think these racists are just as a threat as SJWs. Even bigger, because they are already here on voat. Please help fight them. They can say what they like, because freedom of speech, but please debate them and show them that they are just a loud minority on this site as soon as they show themselves outside of their subverses.

              Racism of every fashion is bad. One reason why I hate SJWs is because they're racist too. Again, every kind of racism sucks, if it's by blacks themselves, by whites or by someone else (israeli or not).

            Since Religion is Dying They are losing their control system, so they are training people to be Hyper offended which feels like religion without religion. This new breed of people gets offended by reason in the exact same way religious people would.

             it applies to both spectrums the rascist and the sjw both have no understanding of nuance and both are carefully constructed archetypes to divide the population.
            </p>
            <p>
             the only cure is to use reason and logic on our selves to unseat our biases and find truth. until we do that we will be like sheep sent to slaughter. going with general consensus and never standing up for anything, but the artificially constructed social war meant to beat us into submission  with our OWN god damn fists.
why are you hitting yourself?

             It feels that way to me too.  How can identify who "they" are in order to put names/faces of those who want to keep us in turmoil?  We must call them out in unison in order pull them out of the shadows.  I imagine the people spreading hate on boards like Voat live pretty shallow lives that all they can do is run around like pack dogs throwing shit at everyone else. This isn't free speech, this is disruption tactics to keep free speech silent.

             I left Reddit after finding out the owner of Conde Nasty sits on the board of directors with David Koch at NY Presbyterian hospital.  The collusion is deep and the hate wing of global freedom and the corporate manipulation bought Reddit. Now they are trying to shut up the moderate voices wherever they may gather.

            It has changed here over the  last  little while and that's a real shame. If you leave and find  a place that's better come back and tell us.  I've tried elsewhere and joined Snapzu, it's a little huggy

            Thanks for stating this.  I wonder if this trend you describe as a Voat phenomenon, rather than being directly something that has happened, is actually the result of something else that has happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            I read a piece (perhaps here, wish I could find it again) about how a modern political strategy is to make sure the public never gets to settle on the truth about anything;  did we win that war?  Well, who did?  Is there ever going to be an end to this crisis?  (All very "1984")  -the idea being that the public, particularly the democratic public, is the enemy of political power in the sense that the more we know what's really happening, the more unhappy about it we're going to be.  Certainly feels like that to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if that's the strategy, the result is bound to be unsettlement and dissatisfaction out in the world.  People are being scammed totally about what's up, and they get crazy because nothing you hear can be trusted...and they bring their craziness here, inchoate as it is. (Not to mention the people being
            <em>
             paid
            </em>
            to create this atmosphere!)
           </p>
           <p>
            We're all in an information blender,  it's not too big a surprise that nothing makes sense and everybody's angry.  That suits the power-game people right down to the ground.

              Well,
              <a href="/user/polkadotgirl">
               @polkadotgirl
              </a>
              , I can't speak for others; my take is much like my username, indefinable.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remember once talking about my sorrows to a friend, I was all embroiled in the story I was telling about my own life, and he grabbed a pause to say, "I'm getting a feeling that you are very sad."   It was a moment of awakening for me.  I realized that the details of my story were relatively unimportant, but to my friend, the way I felt was his perception.  He was right, of course.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I try, reading Voat, to get a sense of my fellow beings.  Yeah, most of them are crazy in some way or another;  I'm not different from them in that.  I like to think about "the story of humanity",  and I'm not really responsible for any part of it larger than what I can personally comprehend or affect.  Other people's development in life and their expressions are deeply interesting to me,  but ultimately none of my business.
             </p>
             <p>
              I take some refuge in a concept:  "You are here on Earth to look after your own development,  physically, mentally, spiritually.  No one else's."
             </p>
             <p>
              So I can look on Voat, and the world, like "The Fool On The Hill" who sees "the sun going down, and the eyes in his head see the world spinning around" -
             </p>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm sorry if this is difficult.  I don't really understand it myself, but it works for me.  I remember reading a phrase by J.R.R. Tolkien, about reading a book, and how you need to have what he called "a suspension of disbelief"  to make the story work for you.    This is something like that...  I think...
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a story, you know?  It's just a story.  What other people do describes them;  it doesn't describe me.

            So you can either leave and make Voat worse OR you can fight harder to create a positive place that is what you desire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't quit because it gets tough. Fuck the haters. You be you and make a place you enjoy into what you want it to be. Unless you're like Amalek or MH101, you're not going to be getting killed in downvotes.
           </p>
           <p>
            So continue to speak up and say what you want to say. FIGHT for your ability to discuss things freely and openly. Don't run from this challenge, make the challenge your goal to produce quality, informative and interesting discussion on here.

            I don't (unfortunately) know how to get the reddit bias from poisoning voat as well, but I DO know it's in full swing.  My posts are downvoted in seconds, and they didn't used to be, even a month or two ago.  Sad -- simple dialogue, educating each other, seems to have gone by the wayside in favor of vicious attacks that have no basis in reality.

             Exactly. That's what it is. It isn't the  views themselves. But when you try to counter those views, they are silenced by downvotes. It was not like this. I used Voat this entire summer every day and had amazing conversations, even with those that disagreed with me.

              Nobody is 'silencing' you, they are simply downvoting. If you're getting downvoted a lot then you must have opinions that are pretty disagreeable. Over on Reddit they all have a liberal marxist SJW hivemind. You can spout off anything which supports their worldview to get massive upvotes and adulation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Reddit removed the true vote counts and inserted "fuzzing" to suppress opinions they didn't agree with. Here on Voat you get to see the actual up and downvotes. When people disagree with you -- it's obvious.
             </p>
             <p>
              People here aren't afraid to stand up and speak out against liberal marxist bullshit. SJW's aren't tolerated. Political correctness is attacked head on. Maybe your views are not as popular as you think?
             </p>
             <p>
              We can still have amazing conversations but, the hivemind circle jerking has to go. You can no longer dismiss another group's ideas just because you don't like them.

            I was wondering why everyone hated minorities and women so much. This woman feminist hate thing is pretty messed up,while there are some who ruin the image of actual womens right acrivist thats no reason to hate on women. But I guess I always have an unpopular opinion.

              I'm honestly confused as to what an SWJ is. Heard others call out environmental activists SJWs for organizing and setting up petitions to rally against big incs. I don't have social media aaode from this so I dont get the whole culuture.

               Really, its like two sides of the same coin! sjw vs sjw, they both want to tell you your ignorant or unpatriotic or call you racist or a nigger lover or sexist. No middle ground, no discussion...ugghh(that's the sound of despair)

            I'm not saying there can't be any truth to some claims about race. However I HAVE done research and in reality we live in a classist society and poverty is the real issue. Race is a distraction tactic.

            It does seem like the last month or so there have been more comments that a troll would make.  And I think you are 100% correct. I had my suspicions when I first came to voat and now it seems like the whole site is just a scam to lure freethinkers away from reddit. Divide and conquer, what a shame.

            I think you could have made this point more effectively without calling me a faggot.
           </p>
           <p>
            But either way this is conspiracy. I feel there is something deeper.
           </p>
           <p>
            A conspiracy could be that you are so programmed and brainwashed that you're one of the shills and you never even considered it. You're working for free!
           </p>
           <p>
            And again I don't get the personal attacks. If you really believe what you believe, have a real conversation with me.

            I'm really glad to see that I'm not the only one starting to feel this way now. It's become one big stomping ground for agendas and manipulation and silencing of alternative views. At this point it seems to be a bunch of children with too much time and too little to do running amuck.

           <p>
            Everything has changed drastically in the last month or two. From the great conversation to great subs to quick admin responses to an effective

            to that cohesive atmosphere, it's all gone to shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure if it's an orchestrated conspiracy or the fact that a large (perhaps majority) percentage of the users here are all from banned Reddit subs or if it's really just a consequence of too many users.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm starting to think that this voting, categorised, moderated form of 'social networking' will always fail because the same tools that make it all work are the tools that can be used to manipulate it and turn it to shit. Starting to think it's a good idea to look for an alternative, something done in a completely different way, maybe with lessons learnt.
           </p>
           <p>
            This sucks but with the current atmosphere here I don't know if there is any other solution but to try something completely different rather then just repackaging the old thing and expecting it to work in new ways.

             It's starting to feel that TPPB want Reddit to be a liberal echo chamber, voat a conservative echo chamber and there to be no place for real dialog in the middle to occur.

             IMHO I think there are no reasons for downvoting any comments. If we just stick to upvotes then it is very easy to tell whats what by the number of (or lack of) upvotes. This would take away some of the negativity.

              How come Asians don't have this problem? They came from poor countries and were given very few opportunities. But, somehow they rose above it, and are thriving. The "black community" on the other hand is nothing but a sinkhole which sucks in money. Nothing has changed. No matter how much money you throw at the problem it never gets any better.

                 it may be hard for you to understand, but it is all those things and one more largely overlooked aspect, historical truama.  it gets passed along through the genertions.  i can see that youre deep set in your opinion however so this isnt really for you, but the others in the peanut gallery.

              Maybe you've been downvoted because problems with race aren't sociological, but racial?

              Maybe defending, what I assume to be, Western women, or minorities in the West, isn't brave, and they don't actually need any defending whatsoever as we already do that here, as do our governments?

              Looking back at these comments, I'm not sure you're as moderate as you claim.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Blank Slatism" regarding race has fewer scientific adherents these days. You may find yourself in a declining minority on this issue.
             </p>
             <p>
              Supporting mass immigration of Muslims into Western Civ puts you in an even smaller but very powerful minority of the population.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of your lowest rated comments are defending u/she. You are defending a single very controversial woman. This doesn't count as defending women in general.
             </p>
             <p>
              So you have some strong agendas. That's fine, but it makes your above claim of being moderate disingenuous. No one is deleting your comments. Downvotes sometimes come with holding controversial opinions, you just gotta roll with it and try not to get offended.

               I'm not sure this is a fair conclusion. Being on the same side of an issue is not a strong agenda. For example, I don't intend to give up my guns -- but I'm not the "cold, dead hands" crowd. Most people don't even know about my guns. Or my opinions on immigration. But without telling you my opinion, I know there is an utterly asinine immigration agenda which would claim me -- no matter what I believe.

                Fair point on she. It appears you were downvoted when commenting on other issues within u/she related threads. I should have read more thoroughly.
               </p>
               <p>
                It looks like you work in an academic environment. You're right that many of your opinions are commonly held there. But I'm surprised that you're not aware that these views are very controversial outside of that world.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also "playing devils advocate" reads like you're deliberately trying to stir up the other side. It's fun and makes voat a more interesting place, but whinging about downvotes in this situation will get you no sympathy from me.

            I completely agree. Something had changed here, and for the worse. I commented on
            <a href="this">
             https://voat.co/v/news/comments/452535

            post just to see what would happen. Is going against the, we must hate all police, agenda. Every comment made that was against that narrative was downvoted. This is a plan to divide and conquer. What stops us from a race war is the police. Attack them from both sides, and the larger narrative takes the attention away from everything else, and directs our attention to this. What happened the last time we had race wars in the 60's? What was our attention being diverted from then?

            Turning people racist? No. Inflaming racial tension? Very much yes. Of course, the racists get to be loud and proud now, alongside those who are trying to discuss legitimate racial issues, so it does seem like the hatred is spreading.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't hate any race, but I do think each race needs to admit their social shortcomings. Political power would seek to abuse such honest introspection to create more division.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, instead of using our new honesty to solve problems, it will be used to create them. They can't get us to argue about "family values",  religion, abortion, or gay rights anymore, so they turn up the volume on race. Now, no one's talking about TPP, the mine spill, China's economy, Nestle, etc. They're talking about some idiot reporter (who conveniently filmed his crimes in first person, too).
           </p>
           <p>
            You get the picture. I just wish we were all mature enough to realize not everyone who criticizes us hates us.

             For that matter I think we need to come to terms with the fact that race is almost entirely incidental.  It's not responsible for any of this.  Circumstances are.  Systemically impoverished groups face hardship whether they're in a ghetto or a trailer park.  Race is not responsible for any of this shit.  It's poor upbringing, it's poor resources, it's poor economic situations.  It's culture. We can separate cultural groups by color, but we also plainly understand that race isn't a requirement of cultural behavior either.

            <p>
             I don't see what's happening on Voat as a planned conspiracy so much as a result of the ongoing division that continues.  So long as we persist to allow haves and have-nots we'll continue to have these problems.  When we as a society can stand on equal footing we will all come to realize how trivial the differences were.
            </p>
            <p>
             The news media is responsible for it's bullshit but we need to take responsibility for buying in to it.

               I'll skip the humorous typo and say that I grew up in Appalachia and those folks are no shining beacon of civility by any means.  Rampant drug abuse and violence abound and an absence of law doesn't mean an absence of lawlessness.  That region is full of "2 cop" towns, and plenty of people willing to lie for each other, and if we get dirty cops in areas with greater oversight how is not pretty obvious that when there's exceptionally little oversight things don't run smoothly?  Another major factor which contributes is what I could call economic confrontation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Statistically speaking the only clear determinate of negative cultural activity is income inequality.  The more equal a general population, the better things seem to run.  So in the mountains you have a whole bunch of people living in roughly the same shitty circumstances and often well spread out.  Poor black communities are generally concentrated around cities where by the very nature of the city they are in close proximity to vast economic disparity.  This is the case whether people are equally rich or equally poor.  I believe one study found that the above average rich of Sweden had higher infant mortality.  The greater your deviation from the mean the more likely to have problems.  That's a big cultural roadblock.

             I think what we are seeing is a societal trend brought about by the media. Yes, voat is full of racial tension right now. On voat (and elsewhere)I think this is caused by a mix of trolls, shills, and actual racists. I don't think voat is the specific target of this trend though. The media has been trying to bring about a race war for years, which I believe is just to distract from the class-war that is already going on.

             That's my take on it anyway.

             It could be trolls pretending to be racists or it could be actual racists. Either way, there's a lot of it about.

            I noticed a bit of a change after the
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate">
             /r/fatpeoplehate
            </a>
            ban, but it didn't get really toxic until the
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/niggers">
             /r/niggers
            </a>
            ban. It brought an onslaught of extremely conservative right-wingers over, and they spilled over into a lot of the bigger subs and started aggressively downvoting everything that didn't fit their narrative and posting a lot of hate-filled shit. I don't think this was intentional on Voat's part, but an unfortunate consequence of Reddit's actions.

             Yes, the downvoting=I disagree from this crowd discourages posting and commenting. I am anti-SJW, but also anti-racist, but I don't feel like my comments have a home in Voat anymore

              Absolutely true, sadly. I've even gone so far as to make this account for discussing these issues, as I'm not keen on having my "main" account hammered into the negatives for voicing my opinion. I don't post much, so it wouldn't take much of a brigade to make my primary account practically unusable.

             I'm confused, by conservative do you mean fiscally conservative? I have found more racist people within the Democratic party then within the Republican party, though I am neither as I don't approve of either party.

              No, by conservative I mean reactionary; resistant to change - fiscal conservativism has nothing to do with this. I guess you might say "socially conservative". Sorry, I'm not American and English is not my first language, didn't consider that the word could be context-sensitive :)

               It's all good. Yea, the socially conservative play along in both parties, but there are also fiscally conservatives in both. It's tricky, especially when you get into politics.

             I agree! I've banned a handful of subs from coming up on my feed and it's better. But when I read the comments in politics :-/ it's just some comments are such bullshit and uneducated. It's like they're meant to offend only.

            While I completely agree with what you're saying in a political sense (Democrats Vs. Republicans, two party bipartisan bullshit), I don't think that's what's happening with Voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been here since February. While things were definitely a bit more mellow in the beginning before people had TONS of reasons to start using this site instead of Reddit, I don't think the recent trend of more racist/sexist/anti-SJW etc posts are an intentional aspect of the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            People are tired of feeling like they have no place in which to express their views or concerns, or even just bitch about their frustrations. Right now Voat is in high-tide for these emotions since people keep getting squished and pushed out of most other mainstream mediums (websites/forums/magazines/whatever). We aren't seeing our views being supported or even allowed anywhere else, so there's a large influx of "edgy" opinions and the like here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think things will once again mellow out a bit more in the coming months, at least to an extent. This is all a side effect of the huge influx of users that we've gotten over the last few months.

              If you want to be on the more "moderate" side of things then you could always block subs like FPH or the ones dedicated to highlighting black crimes. That should filter out a fair bit.
             </p>
             <p>
              When it comes down to it though, I do think that Voat does a better job of discussing news as it actually happens (besides all the clickbait bullshit that's recently been cropping up in
              <a href="/v/news">
               /v/news
              </a>
              ). I think a lot of it also has to do with the way that people approach subjects on this website, either through a realist or even pessimistic mindset; I suspect this somewhat negative outlook is, once again, a result of people feeling as if they've been alienated and excluded from other mediums and feeling unwelcomed to share their opinions elsewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you keep pushing a group against a wall, they'll only start pushing back harder. That's what's happening now. I think given time to settle on Voat people will level out a bit more once the hype and frustration has died down a bit.

               Honestly I only blocked like one racist sub. However the majority of racism I see is on the larger subs. So now I should block those? I feel that defeats the purpose of being here. I come here for news.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't even care if there are racist comments. Instead it's the brigrading.

                "Zionists" use Jews as a cover. Were there "Zionists" 1800 years ago when the first nation the Jews got expelled from was Carthage? No.

                JEWS are the threat, Zionists are just a cover. As long as JEWS are in OUR COUNTRIES, we will continue to have this problem.

                Good. The zionist-jews are the ones who created these problems. Unfortunately, the rest of the jews don't stand up and say anything against the zionists. Israel is

             It isn't. But it's suprising that nearly all these views are completely supported and they went before.

              Yea dude, it's been really cool hanging around this site. People seem nice and I have actually gotten good advice here multiple times. But as for the news it always seemed lacking compared to reddit. And since this week started there has been no worthwhile world news to me at all. I feel like they have very effectively separated us and disrupted our sense of world knowing. Knowledge is power and no one wants that for us.

            Consider that many people are on voat as a reaction to reddit banning the subs that are fat shaming, racist and hate mongering. It is no surprise that the user base is highly reactionary and unstable. I am not very happy about it either, and am considering moving on due to the overly negative and childish attitude that many users seem to have.

             Stop dismissing any point you don't like as "racism" and actually address the issue fairly. This sticking your head up your ass is what has led to black males, 7% of the population in the US, committing 50% of the murders and robberies in this country and hundreds of communities and major cities across the US being lost to blacks that have caused urban blight. There comes a point when you can't just shut down discussion you don't like anymore when people are being raped, murdered and robbed and entire communities are falling to the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you actually believe you're right defend yourself. The reason you have to silence "racism" is because for the most part there is no real logical answer to these claims besides excuses for it.

               No its not. They are shitty anywhere in the world even their home countries. South Africa went from being one of the most wealthy countries in the world to another shit filled rape hole after all the whites were run out. They did this in Haiti too. They are not able to form or live in peaceful, civilized, society.

            This is exactly what was said of Reddit. That's why it concerns me.

             I'd hoped enough people would migrate over that the racists would be marginalized. Unfortunately, reddit banned the racist subs right when VOAT opened registration, intentionally, I'm sure. Not enough people on reddit wanted to follow a bunch of racists over here, so that's all we are left with...

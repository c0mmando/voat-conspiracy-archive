            "Clare W. Bronfman, an heiress of the Seagram Company business empire, allegedly implanted a "key logger" virus on the computer of her late father, Edgar M. Bronfman Sr., so officials with the NXIVM corporation could secretly monitor his emails, including his exchanges with world leaders and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, according to court records.

            "In 2012, the Times Union was provided copies of emails attributed to a Mexican journalist who sent a series of emails to Foley trying to convince her to come to Mexico for an interview regarding a story on NXIVM. The journalist did not respond to a request for comment.

            Allison Mack will be released on $5 million bond stemming from sex-trafficking charges, Yahoo Entertainment confirms. She will serve home detention with electronic monitoring until her next court date.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Smallville star was in federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday where Mack’s mother, Melinda Mack, put up her home in Los Alamitos, Calif. as collateral, in addition to property and a bank account owned by Allison Mack. According to Variety, Allison Mack will live with her parents during home detention.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lawyer for Mack entered a “not guilty” plea following her arrest on Friday. If convicted on all charges, Mack could face up to 15 years in prison. It’s believed that she is working on a plea deal with federal prosecutors
           </p>
           <p>
            Allison Mack was released on the condition she serve home detention with electronic monitoring. The conditions of her bail allow her to travel to Southern California and to the New York City area where her criminal attorneys are based. Mack’s attorneys said she intended to return to her parents home as soon as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mack’s father, opera singer Jonathan Mack, was not in court but is obligated to co-sign her bail collateral arrangement by May 4. The judge instructed Allison Mack not to associate with anyone connected, past or present, to the Nxivm group that is the source of the sex trafficking charge she faces. According to court documents, Mack is accused of trying to destroy emails, text messages and other material connected with the case against her and Raniere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before the hearing, prosecutors and Mack’s attorneys huddled on an agreement to severely restrict Mack’s ability to access the Intenet and online communications. The side agreed to conditions that she would have access to a phone that would limit her to reviewing emails only from her lawyers.

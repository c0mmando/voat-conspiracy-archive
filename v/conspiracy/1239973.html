              It has been rising for 13,000 years. In that time, it has never risen more slowly than right now. Were our ancestors belching out CO2 faster than we were? Maybe they were farting a lot more. It’s rising more slowly than at any time in that history, and it’s also rising more slowly than

            <p>
             You don't dictate anything. Your disagreement is spam, because that's all it is. You simply don't like my opinion. Get over it. You're not an authority on anything but your own skin for the short time you are alive.
            </p>
            <p>
             You live, you swallow what bullshit you're told to, you use your labor to make others richer than you'll ever be, and then you die.

            <p>

            Lots of those jobs will be offset with new jobs in renewables. But yeah. Jobs are going to start dropping like flies in the next twenty years. We have to start sharing the benefits of automation so that the answer to "What am I gonna do when I lose my job!?" becomes "Enjoy your free time."

              I believe it'll happen eventually. For sure. There's no stopping it.

            Sounds a lot like you're trying to play the "lesser of two evils" card. Thats the mindset that landed the modern world in perpetual war. Soros may or may not be worse than the kochs, but theres no reason we cant hate them all equally.

            Climate damage is still real. Keep downvoating without responding. I'm from the great lakes region and it used to be in winter you could drive a truck across the ice all winter long. To  ice fish, to get to the islands, whatever. You can't do any of that for even one month anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're just a bunch of children butt hurt over the details. Of course we were lied to about climate change, it's deliberate. Climate change is deliberate. They don't want us knowing the real causes. That's why we only ever talk about carbon when it isn't even the leading problematic element in the equation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop being mad that you're all too poor and stupid to be given the truth and look around and find it yourself.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is tall damage, but it is calculated and deliberate. Giving a fuck about what comes out of the mouths of puppets is still giving a fuck about something they want us to pay attention to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pay attention to real details, not the obviously fake ones that you can jerk off to for being smart enough to tell they're fake.

             1) Demonstrate “climate change” is real.
            </p>
            <p>
             No problem there! There is plenty of geological evidence that the Earth has been much warmer for most of its existence. The Jurassic period, for example, was quite a bit warmer than today. In fact, there have only been a few colder times in Earth’s history compared to today. And ‘climate’, in the strictest sense, changes daily.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Demonstrate that “climate change” is manmade.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is tougher, since we already know for a fact that the Earth has been through far warmer periods before man ever showed up. Indeed, evidence is mounting that an increase in CO2 is causing less extreme weather, not more.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Demonstrate that any changes, regardless of origin, happening now are man-reversible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good luck with that.
            </p>
            <p>
             4) Demonstrate that they can be reversed, primarily, by crippling the American economy in particular, while nations like China and India continue polluting the planet at record rates.
            </p>
            <p>
             And that’s where you lose your audience.

              My experience with the great lakes in my life time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yeah, the great lakes used to freeze for the whole winter and people drove across them in trucks...
             </p>
             <p>
              It's been dacades since that happened. People around here used to ice fish. They don't anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              I used to be bitten by insects when I walked through wooded and wet areas, I don't anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              I used to see white all winter long, and now I'm lucky to see it for a week at a time.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many large bodies of matter do I have to notice a difference in before your demands look shallow and irrelevant?
             </p>
             <p>
              My proof is years of experience and the years of my families experience in nature, through generations.

             <p>
              Your disbelief is just convenient to your distaste for the people using climate change as a political tool.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: I'm not here to prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt, no one can actually do that. I'm simply sharing my experience. My observations are q peice of the puzzle, Not a complete explanation. I don't have that kind of experience yet. But evidently you have enough to insist that I need to meet your demands for my observations to be accurate. They are just the world from where I'm standing, and from here, things are notably more mild all around.

                That's all good and dandy. I'm not really arguing for global warming. I'm arguing for deliberate climate change.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's just my hunch. The fact that there is so much disagreement and disinformation implies, heavy handedly, that climate change has only to do with the simple and two dimensional concept of heating and cooling...
               </p>
               <p>
                They can argue global warming because it's generally true over time. But it isn't what is causing what we're seeing.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are distracting from something climate based, not only pushing a false narrative. From what?  When there is no change in climate for most people it covers their lie, when there IS climate change they can pull out their false narrative, and continue to cover their lie while simultaneously pulling some shady shit.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not going to jump on any band wagon view on these stances people like to take. This is what I think. I don't care much about your slightly bigger measuring stick in your 'measurements' that you'd like to site.  Do your measurements read the room? Do they see body language, and convenience of the narrative pushers?
               </p>
               <p>
                Keep denying climate change. That works to the convenience of the liars in question here. Unless you want to assume that politicians are bringing up the topic of climate change just to lie to us for no reason.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's more here than just shallow political maneuvers. They can lie about anything to do that, why global warming?
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry for the ramblerant, and
thanks for the responses. I know this is all half baked. Not enough data all around. Just some of the things I've mulled over in repetition.

                  I don't care much about your slightly bigger measuring stick in your 'measurements' that you'd like to site. Do your measurements read the room? Do they see body language, and convenience of the narrative pushers?

              One other big bad element in the equation is methane. Which no one discusses in length despite it being far more dense and prevalent in our industries.

              I obviously don't have all the answers, but it doesn't take peer reviewed research to make a simple and obvious observation over your life time.

             <p>
              I have a theory that the heat up is deliberate to unlock the resources under the poles. Thus the half assed effort at preventing the third most problematic element from being too prevalent(carbon).

              A great way to access new land, and simultaneously have a great excuse to 'accidentally' have a good chunk of the obsolete masses die off as the worlds oceans rise and change the livable landscape for humans.

                You basically said nothing. Maybe make a point that doesn't require you to pick apart my statements individually.

                Individually those sentences are weak. But the body of their meaning is avoided when you copy and paste like you're proud to have just graduated kindergarten.

               <p>
                I'm speaking from my experience in living next to the biggest bodies of fresh water in the world. So excuse me for simply putting my observations out there.
               </p>
               <p>
                In living next to very large swamp, and great lakes regions, I grew up being bitten, by insects and frost, like my parents, and theirs before them. That has gone away. It doesn't get cold enough to drive a truck across the lakes anymore. There are less insects, and the ones that remain seem lethargic and slow in comparison to their ancestors.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, How many huge bodies of matter do I have to notice change in before you can get over the fact that climate change has been politicized. Something being a political tool does not make that something imaginary.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can have a theory and it be wrong, it literally is just another opportunity to learn.  But I'm sure you've looked under the glaciers and seen for yourself.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have the proof that I have. My observations are one piece of a puzzle. You can ignore that, since it would be easier for your world view, or you can take it for what it is; my and my families experience living next to a once a very robust seasonal area, that is suddenly not very robust.

           <p>
            He and Obama worked very, very hard to earn their Nobel peace prizes. If Al Gore didn't make that video the earth wouldn't even be here right now. Because of his video, the planet is saved from global warming. He also gave us the internet.

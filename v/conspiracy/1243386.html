<p>A music video by Bieber was released a year ago. People of the internet realized that when slowed down, messages were embedded in the video.</p>
<p>Many times they put messages and symbols in videos but this time they were extremely brazen with some of the messages. Most of the messages are downright terrifying.</p>
<p>My analysis of the video is that they tell us that Zika virus is their creation and that if we are reading the message now it was too late to do anything about it. I wish I were making this up...</p>
<p>Here is the video with analysis. I didn\'t make this video. Below are my ideas on some of the things the narrator left out. You can skip to 6:50 if you don\'t want the premise of the creation of the video however I suggest you watch the whole thing.</p>

<p>Pay attention to where he analyzes the words &quot;2013 was practice, 2014 was the warmup.&quot;</p>
<p>I believe they were talking about the 2014 FIFA games where there was a Zika scare. I believe they are doing test runs the last few years which is why we saw a few Zika spikes.</p>

<p>Then note that one of the slides talks about &quot;If your reading this now it\'s already too late.&quot; and Justin had a World Health Organization shirt on with his brain blown out.</p>
<p>Just so happens now reports are showing that Zika effects the brains of adults too. They are spreading a disease that causes degenerative brain function which eventually causes paralysis and death.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/zika-may-cause-brain-damage-in-adults-too">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-19/zika-may-cause-brain-damage-in-adults-too</a></p>
<p>I would also like to note that scientists came out and stated that microcephaly was NOT being caused by Zika.</p>
<p><a href="http://secondnexus.com/ecology-and-sustainability/zika-is-not-to-blame/">http://secondnexus.com/ecology-and-sustainability/zika-is-not-to-blame/</a></p>
<p>Its my hypothesis that the Genetically modified Mosquitos that are being dumped in Puerto Rico, California, Florida and other states and countries, are actually most likely spreading the disease of Zika or some virus they are masking as Zika.
There are reports that 1 in 4 Puerto Ricans will have acquired the virus by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zika-virus-spreads-in-puerto-rico/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zika-virus-spreads-in-puerto-rico/</a></p>
<p>Ask yourself, why is Zika being spread so quickly now after being around forever.</p>
<p>Why was this predicted in that video?</p>
<p>Why and who put all this fucked up shit in this video?</p>
<p>How did reports go from &quot;only effecting newborns&quot; to all of a sudden &quot;effecting adult brains with Alzheimer\'s like symptoms&quot;. Almost as if they knew this info already.</p>
<p>This my friends, I believe is how it goes down.</p>
<p>Any other sub I place this in I get a lot of tinfoil hat comments and censorship.</p>
<p>Which tells me I\'m right on the nose.</p>
<p>Would like your thoughts. Good luck.</p>',

            The Zika virus is a massive cover up. All the birth defects taking place and many illnesses and deaths are very real! The cause though is not mosquitoes... the cause is Fukushima Radiation! Radiation causes so many types of birth defects and then it cause all sorts of disease(cancers, auto immune diseases, heart attacks, lung problems). my goodness the list is endless. FUKUSHIMA FUKUSHIMA FUKUSHIMA! These nuclear meltdowns are causing so much death and destruction and its world wide with the northern hemisphere being hit the hardest. The pacific ocean is dead. We are living through an extinction event and the reason being Nuclear...

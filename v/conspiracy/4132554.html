<p>This is going to be some pretty dystopian shit. It’s going to come across as fear porn, but I promise you that’s not the intent.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I am not a shill and I haven’t taken a vaccine since the tuberculosis one I took in elementary school. I am very much against vaccines, not against the science behind them, but against the fact that they are loaded with all kinds of disgusting trash and human DNA, metals, etc., not to mention that there is basically zero transparency.</p>
<p>Now that that’s out-of-the-way...</p>
<p>So last year I listened to this guy David Goldberg in a video he recorded in May. I listened to it because he died in a suspicious way in June and it was his last recording, which made me interested in learning what he had to say. For those of you who haven’t listened to it, it can be basically summarized as:</p>
<p>The elites have a secret plan (Project Pogo) to use social media to determine all the anti-Zionist people in the US, then systematically kill them (Project Zyphr). The documents that he had access to supposedly detailed to some degree how they would achieve this in a sneaky way that would not lead to a mass uprising / fight, because they realized that as many as 15 million people would have to die in order to achieve their goals of getting rid of anti-Zionists in order to usher in a new world order.</p>
<p>When I first listened to this last year I didn’t think much of it, other than the fact that he had been found dead with foam coming out of his mouth which sounds like a deep state murder kind of thing. Other than that, it seemed pretty ridiculous. But then one of the things he said was gonna happen did happen, which was the rolling power outages in California. David said in one of his videos that “they” would experiment with a small area power outage “later this year” (2019) to prepare and measure the response before they implement a large scale power outage “next year” (2020). Then another thing he said came almost true. He said that Trump would declare himself the “king of Israel”. Last September a guy, I don’t recall his position, stated exactly this, that Trump was essentially the “king of Israel”, and Trump quoted the guy in his own tweet. In other words, Trump tweeted the text stating that he was the “king of Israel”, and even though he was just quoting with somebody else said, he was also acknowledging it and thanking the guy. If I had to come up with a percentage of “Yep that prediction came true“ I would say that’s about 75% of the way there.</p>
<p>Here’s where it starts to get scary.</p>
<p>David Goldberg said that the way they would get rid of the anti-Zionist dissidents is with a virus. So ever since the coronavirus situation started I’ve been thinking about this, thinking about “yeah but how could they kill all these people specifically without raising suspicion”, until I realized “wait a minute, contact tracing…”. We already know that they plan on taking people out of their house who are suspected to have contracted the coronavirus based on close contact with other suspected cases. They’ve laid the groundwork in many areas for this, including incorporating contact tracing into iOS and Android OS. They also made it so that you can’t go to the hospital to visit loved ones, so if somebody you know gets taken out of their house because of “coronavirus” and taken to a hospital, there wouldn’t be any way for you to go there and verify that they truly were sick or not. So then when they call you and say “we are sorry to tell you Johnny has died”, it might be suspicious but they would have a layer of plausible deniability. So imagine a scenario where a third wave (this propaganda has already begun) starts to spread and it is a much more deadly version of the virus with a supposed death rate of 5%. Now imagine all the people who are suspected of coming into contact with this super scary new version of the virus start being taken out of their homes and dying in the hospital, which fulfills the fear panic needed to keep it going, while simultaneously giving them the ability to remove tired of people without any real suspicion. If they did this now everybody would be suspicious, but if they did it during a “much deadlier” version and the whole country was on lockdown in panic mode, despite some suspicion from people like us, they would definitely be able to pull something like this off.</p>
<p>So that was kind of a mode of thinking that I was in for the past few months until I had an epiphany. I was thinking about how in the video David put out that he never said anything about the virus being fake. And whatever access he had to whatever documents he had was definitely something, otherwise his predictions would not have already come true to the degree they did. So if he was saying that they were planning to get rid of these dissidents with a virus, then unless he had a gross misunderstanding of the meaning, it doesn’t seem like my above scenario is the correct M.O.</p>
<p>This is where it gets really scary.</p>
<p>Think about how politicized coronavirus response has become. If you wear a mask your leftist, if you don’t wanna wear a mask you’re right wing, if you believe in HCQ’s power, you’re a Trump supporter, etc. As time has gone by, it has become more and more split down party line and you can easily see this happening. People on our side are very much opposed to taking any vaccine, but especially a vaccine that is being promoted by some scoundrel like Bill Gates. So think about this: what more efficient way could you think of to kill all of the people like us then to make us Vehemently opposed to this vaccine, and then release a virus that kills everyone who didn’t take this vaccine. They would literally kill all of the skeptical minded people and probably a lot of the generally right leaning people in a single fell swoop. This would be World War III done in a single year. Especially if what they released was airborne; there would be no escape.</p>
<p>I don’t know about you, but this possible scenario gives me fucking nightmares.</p>

            It's possible but the vaccine is still more dangerous than any virus they could make for now. Also, if the goal is to kill anti-zionists the plan wouldn't really work. There are loads of vaccine skeptical zionist civnats and quite a few anti zionist leftists who will eat, drink or inject whatever CNN tells them to.

            Jews don't want to kill half of the population of the United States. The Jews want to perturb us into killing people. They are opportunists that feed off of the internal conflict of the nations they parasitize. Think of it like a star, like our sun. It's pretty great for us because of the exact amount of energy it puts off. Just enough fusion to resist the collapsing force of it's own gravity. Now, if the sun went supernova and exploded, sure a ton of energy would get released, but it would be dangerous for us - we could no longer use it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Same thing with the Jew. They like getting other people into conflicts and benefitting commercially from the wars...they aren't in the business of wiping people out generally, unless you're a Palestinian making claims to their holy land. Then they'll kill you. But by nature the Jew is an instigator. They just want everyone in turmoil, not dying en masse.

<p>One thing to note, my theory might be flawed because if you count the first page, the numbers are off by one, so he might also refer to chapter one &quot;Laying out plans&quot;</p>

<p>What could f/n mean? A simple search doesnt give me any answers, it looks like a code. Tzuesday? February 1st isnt Tueaday, it must be a code too. I doubt the Tzar theory because Tsar how the Russians write it but it is quite possible (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar)</a>)</p>',

            His MO has been to pay off protesters (who are therefore mercenaries), incite violence at what would otherwise would have been a peaceful protest, not pay guys to shoot up some joint.
           </p>
           <p>
            His funding and transfers were cut off, protesters didn't get paid, and riot/protester leaders did not show up in their agreed upon locations in various cities, the weekend of Nov 4th. The shooting in Texas occurred after, and was not necessarily related.

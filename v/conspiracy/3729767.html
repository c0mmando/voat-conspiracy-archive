             No need.  America has been bankrupted by shysters and the banking system.  This pandemic is just cover for the crash of this evil system, and the resulting confusion and infighting is causing instability that will result in draconian laws that don't favor smart people.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember all those CEO's leaving?  They saw what was happening and extrapolated all this.  They left because China has refused to trade without getting physical goods in return.  The narrative that America should decouple from China is a narrative to cover for China giving the US the middle finger.
            </p>
            <p>
             All this hostility toward China is also cover for the economic hardship about to befall America.  In times of war people accept more hardships.  However, the internet has exposed the lies and Americans are questioning moves for more power by the USG.
            </p>
            <p>
             America is in for very hard times.

              naturally i am hoping for a little bit of cushion for the country, but knowing that there is going to be some shit going down soon, hopefully. hoping the down time will rid the country of the weak and corrupt. not a super fan of the President, but thinking he's had to give a little to get to the objective. i am hoping he's really for the American people and the country will not be worse on the return

               I hope, but also have to be realistic.  He has neo-conservatives in his administration.  While I understand the motive of these neo-conservatives, I don't like the path that they've taken (Search for Adam Curtis on youtube and watch his "The Power Of Nighmares" series.)  What's bad is that this pandemic looks a lot like another false flag along the lines of what the neo-conservatives would do.

               So, basically, most "awake" people don't fully trust what they're being told because of the prior lies told to them over and over.  And, thus many who own guns or are hunkered down, expecting to die in a martial law situation.  Not able to organize and not able to really see the big picture, their only option is to lash out if confronted.

            From the site:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The key element to understand the process that the USA will enter in the upcoming decade is migration. In the past, specially in the 20th century, the key factor that allowed the USA to rise to its colossus status was immigration with the benefits of a demographic expansion supporting the credit expansion and the brain drain from the rest of the world benefiting the States. The collapse of the Western financial system will wipe out the standard of living of its population while ending ponzi schemes such as the stock exchange and the pension funds. The population will be hit so badly by a full array of bubbles and ponzi schemes that the migration engine will start to work in reverse accelerating itself due to ripple effects thus leading to the demise of the States.
            </p>

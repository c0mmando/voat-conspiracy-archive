            Well, I would say calling someone (trump) "not my christian" publicly is targetting a citizen for political slander and for political reasons.  Francis was thus propagandizing for Hillary Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now people will say, "oh he was just confused...tricked by the media and propaganda into believing Hillary Clinton is a good person".  Nope!  The Vatican has spies, and they are embedded in the CIA, believe it.  Some call the CIA 'catholics in action' because nearly all of Obama's National Security Council were from Jesuit universities and some were knights of malta, a para-catholic type of fraternity of basically criminals that move money around for big banks including the vatican
           </p>
           <p>
            Pope Francis himself was is a Jesuit, of one of the highest orders, prior to becoming the white pope.  He was essentially 1 or 2 (iirc) ranks from 'black pope' the head of the jesuit order
           </p>
           <p>
            Jesuits are the people going around inciting divisiveness among the people. It's literally their job to use domestic terrorism and the hegelian dialectic to divide people
           </p>
           <p>
            So forgive me for disagreeeing with you somewhat OP but Jesuits have always been about dividing, not uniting people...and this migration is not meant to unite people (tower of babel) but rather to cause crime, divisiveness and use migrants as a way to utterly fracture and destroy societies
           </p>
           <p>
            Societies and cultures need time to build.  They don't happen overnight.  When you have large movements of other culture though a culture you basically cause big problems.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why gypsies are looked upon so poorly.  They have their own closed migratory culture that somewhat 'bleeds' into the main cultures that it visits and it's a culture of magic, criminality, and most of all con artistry and guile and most cultures don't or won't get behind that and they shouldn't.  No one should 'get behind' a culture that glorifies treachery
           </p>
           <p>
            WHich is why I find it very difficult to believe anyone would support the Clintons, least of all the G D Catholic POPE!
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, Jorge Bergolio, pope francis is from argentina, specifically buenos aires where many italians settled after their mid to late 19th century migration from italy basically collapsin in the same way america is now...it was their depression and they fled to argentina and the the US to be blacksmiths, plumbers and restauranteurs and waste mgmt ppl...nothing much has changed
           </p>
           <p>
            Bergolio is from there.  He rose in the ranks at around the same time that Licio Gelli of Propaganda DUE fame in Italy came to it's fifth act.  Propaganda due was a conspiracy by freemasons to run a sicilian mafia with help from various corrupt police, corrupt officials, and corrupt intelligence in switzerland, italy, france and the US to cause false-flag terror bombings at train stations, all coordinated out of a  'secret lodge' propaganda due in italy.  He was caught and tried and convicted, but then escaped jail and fled to switzerland, was caught, extradited, then fled again to france and from there to argentina, where he evaded the authorities for DECADES and finally died last year or 2 yrs ago
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect it's not like he retired. He probably had been running freemasonic false flags all over the world.  Now what else was happening in argentina while bergolio was rising in the ranks of the jesuits (and defying mainstream catholocism with what others called 'heresies') ---oh yes, he was making decisions as high ranking catholic to fund a military junta in argentina, the argentine civil war, which separated people from their children...children that were kidnapped, reweaponized and then installed into new clergy, administrative or military positions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nice guy huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            So I agree with OP that hes the antichrist, but not sure i agree with the reasons
           </p>
           <p>
            The forced migrations things are explained by George Webb...they are basically using weaponized migration patters to blow up the society that are recipients of the migrants
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump was onto this and that he opposed it meant he was an enemy of the prevailing establishment, which is basically the deepstate, the deepstate are the bad guys trying to use migration, migrants and sanctuary cities to run drug, stolen car, organ harvesting ratlines ...as a means to fund blackops, which are then used to try to control the populations both foreign AND domestic in a gladio type scheme
           </p>
           <p>
            POPE Francis is complicit in this, may be running it.  Not sure

            Obvious facts- sounds like an emotional argument. The pope is a Jesuit, and his followers would be Catholic. Biblically he destroyed it, because the human sacrifices and the false idol worship of Baal. I personally don't buy the story- but lets try to keep it on FACTS, the POPE doesn't have anyone best interest but the banks he and his profit off of. 
As for the fucking bible, haven't seen that one. IS this the one you a have gotten these golden nuggets from ? Hmm?
They are in control of the largest pedo ring, they aint ever giving that up.

            Bro, bro.  Listen.   Catholics are not the same as christians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just so we're clear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Christians beleieve that Christ incarnated as Jesus, and then was crucified, opening a direct connection for our prayers to God.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catholics is the roman interpretation of christianity, they pray to pedophile bishops and a false king who preaches from a satan chair inside of a serpents head.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are different religions.

            babylon came to pass, we all missed it. most are now virtual. some of us have been fighting while others are just noticing.
           </p>
           <p>
            my honest memory and pained heart surmise a specific pattern, noticeably in
            <em>
             media
            </em>
            as a point of reference, around 1990-1994, evil with an
            <em>
             obvious presence
            </em>
            in contemporary society.
           </p>
           <p>
            when surveying literature and educational books from the 60s and 70s, one might see our empiricism slide right into spirituality, with the 80s bringing in sex and emotion as art. subversion at its peak power and influence, through media.

            Why Pakistan REALLY Remains in the Crosshairs of the Pentagon
October 6, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Pakistan is predominantly an islamic country, its banking system is therefore largely sharia-based and most people want to be part of this only when it comes to banking.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Pakistani government and the State Bank of Pakistan continue to respond to this growing public demand by supporting the islamic banking industry's mass media sharia banking campaigns, in addition to conducting seminars, conferences, targeted programs and focused discussions for business communities, academia, bankers and policy makers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also in Pakistan islamic (sharia-based) banking is based on (co)ownership, not on interest schemes. Therefore it is far harder to rig and sabotage this kind of banking system than it is with the western(-ized) counterpart. If in islamic banking there is no asset involved or true belief in potential no deal will be reached - or no loan will be granted. This in addition to the moral (religious) aspect of islamic banking that doesn't allow usury (interest) and several other forms of business. A casino or porn company for instance would never get a loan or investment from a sharia-based bank. Nor would any such bank be in any way involved in the kind of perverted "entertainment" productions such as Miley Cyrus (alike) concerts. It would also not fund or take part in a music industry segment that deteriorates the minds of the youths with vile lyrics that defy any sense of decency. I seriously doubt that even "we're gonna die young" (Kesha song) would be acceptable as a business opportunity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Credit-wise, in the west and westernized (credit-based) countries banks systematically facilitate the financing of loans to people who are already in financial distress or who are even already insolvent. When the global heist started to unravel in 2007 (the start of the so-called financial "crisis") it became clear that indeed millions of loans had been granted to folks who were already in debt way over their heads, who were already struggling to pay off their credits. Yet they were granted fresh loans and mortgages on top of their existing loans, while the banks knew very well that disaster for these folks was just around the corner (loss of properties -- homelessness). This practice has not been ceased, it continues this very day and it will eventually contribute to another "surprise crash". In sharia banking this would not be allowed or be possible.

            Laura Loomer, "Investigative" Alternative Media "Journalist", is Provably a Likud Asset... and She May Not Even Know it Herself
October 6, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Poison Ivy Loomer
Someone has to tell the world who she really works for because she poses a grave danger to the hardcore investigative rebellion.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have already seen enough to know for a fact that she is an asset of forces that she may not even be aware of, but I doubt that the latter is the case though.
           </p>
           <p>
            She has been spouting decoy after decoy in the ongoing Las Vegas shooting news cycle (Stephen Paddock is "the killer" is a decoy, the hotel room receipt is also a decoy. Both prove nothing and only put up a smoke screen.) and it is time that someone exposes her for what she really, and merely, is. I bet the Irgun Likud party is having a ball over her online escapades at this very moment. They're enjoying their bowls of seasoned falafals as they take note of the success that she has had so far.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the sad part is that many have already been duped at this stage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Provably she is a zionist jew (don't be fooled, zionists fund all sides of conflicts, see Rothschilds et al; and also in Ukraine for instance [1, 2, 3]) that is being used by the Likud party to poison your mind with anti muslim and anti islam propaganda - specifically using this shooting and trying to link it to ISIS. This has demonstrably been one of the goals of the Israeli press since day one, on October 1. I told you that the event is about something else and that Paddock was not the shooter, although the patsy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her MO is a popular one. First inject your poison in the alt media and truther community through platforms like Infowars and then create a character for yourself that people will look up to. Even if based on false information and deception. Most "truthers" won't ever find out anyway or are too stupid to actually see what is unfolding in front of them. Loomer proves this all by herself that that is the reality because there are already hundreds (if not thousands) out there who see her as some kind of respectable leader figure. Go figure...
           </p>
           <p>
            A swift glance over her Facebook page and Twitter feed instantly raises red flags, it shows that she is poison and that she therefore should be avoided at all costs. Once you allow her to establish credibility in your mind you are lost and put on a sidetrack where you mean no harm anymore. Whether you know it or believe it or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should know that there is no ISIS in the Philippines, not three months ago - not today. Yet if you would take her waffling serious you'd be of the opinion that there is. "Vegas shooter wires $100,000 to ISIS [in the Philippines]". What a lie, how poisonous. This smells (stinks) like Likud propaganda from miles away.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's another one of her Irgun traps:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I have received intel that the woman who went to the front row of the concert in Las Vegas and told people 'you're all going to die' is in custody and she is Muslim."
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside from her fraudulent "sources" she is the only one spouting this nonsense but it seems that many Trump groupies are buying it nonetheless.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that she is directly affiliated with Ezra Levant, also a hardcore zionist jew, proves that his outfit "The Rebel Media" is a limited hangout and that there is nothing rebellious about it. This last part I already knew for a very long time but it is now appropriate to mention this here.

            My Final Comment on This False Flag Attack
October 6, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            There were multiple shooters, even AFTER the central patsy ("Paddock") was already dead. Shots were fired at other nearby hotels, 45 minutes after the "Harvest" shooting had ended. The limited number of accounts like those from Rene Downs prove that. The press and authorities have purged that information and reporting to the greatest possible extent. I have seen similar behavior concerning other aspects of this event. That is explained below.
           </p>
           <p>
            There never were "lines of ambulances" in Vegas that night. There's not a single photo that indicates that (and later backdating freshly added photoshopped photos doesn't count, obviously). Not even an aerial photo of it exists. That part of the fabricated story also never happened and the emergency units that were present were simply blocked from entering the concert area. People were literally left to die by those who controlled the whole event, up until the smashing of the two Mandalay Bay hotel room windows THE NEXT MORNING.
           </p>
           <p>
            No crucial aerial photos exist of the entire massacre, not because there were no helicopters (there were actually), but because photos and video footage from way up would have revealed too many clues and would have provided ample leads that there were shooters among or near the crowd on the ground and were not shooting from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is not a single video that exists today that has documented even the faintest impression of there having been fired shots from the 32nd floor at all. NONE whatsoever, and there are loads of videos by now and from different angles. Not a single muzzle flash has been captured by anyone. Reflections of strobes and other concert lights, street lights and camera flashes are not muzzle flashes. This proves all by itself that the shooters were either among the crowd or nearby but certainly not at the Mandalay Bay as the press has been reporting.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've already said that the Mossad was involved in this, that is explained below.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can add now is that it was a deliberate slaughter perpetrated by the government. EVERYTHING points in that direction, that is also further explained below.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a final note I want to say that I have once again seen the incompetence of the alleged alternative media, overall. There are exceptions but they are truly few. Like I said, the alt media can't connect two dots on a bed of nails and they have proven this once again. Although they sometimes dare to float an opposing view toward the mainstream press, they are in fact largely not any better.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say this because the apparent average narrative in the alternative media today is that "Paddock" was the shooter or "killer", even if he was a patsy. I say he is indeed a patsy but never fired a shot at that crowd, and certainly not from the 32nd floor, but that hasn't stopped the alt media to feed off of this lie and spin it in favor of their agendas (as if the fake suicide note or hotel room receipt mean anything. As if they are of any value or importance. All they are meant to do is distract you from the real perpetrators).
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact we should all go as far and say that the Paddock line is a distraction at best. It is basically irrelevant because all that does is hide the identities of the ones who smashed the hotel room windows AFTER Paddock was already dead. And the identities of the puppeteers behind the scene of this huge spectacle. Obviously, this one isn't staying in Vegas at all.

            I Think Facebook Advertising is at Least "25%" SCAM
October 6, 2017
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's why...
           </p>
           <p>
            When you actually pay attention to what the press puts out you'll find out that in this instance, Facebook wrote this on its own newsroom website, in reference to alleged "Russian ads" during the US campaigning and elections:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Roughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone. That’s because advertising auctions are designed so that ads reach  people based on relevance, and certain ads may not reach anyone as a result."
           </p>
           <p>
            If you have ever purchased advertising on Facebook, which I have never done and never will do, then this FB statement should make you wonder how many people and eyeballs you have actually reached with your banner or text ad on Facebook's website.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they admit that "the Russians" their ads weren't even served in 25% of the cases then why would this be any different with yours?
           </p>
           <p>
            There's no way for you to check and conclude with a 100% certainty that what you paid for was also actually served and consumed as should be.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have seen many ad systems (free and paid), networks and their operational backbone and I can tell you that even Facebook is actively and deliberately part of malware popup schemes that are all over the net. knowingly infecting your PC's or mobile phone's system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would you take their word when going into an ad deal with them? More so after finding out what has happened to the above mentioned ads.
           </p>
           <p>
            If it is so that indeed the 25% ads were sold but not served then by any definition that is a scam operation that I wouldn't want to be part of in any way, certainly not as buyer. With a $9.32 billion Q2 revenue (25% of that is $2.33 billion) one is left to ponder how much of that was earned through that same 25% scam.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, I have several contacts that have used Facebook advertising in the past and NONE of them had noticed any response whatsoever, they claim. I'm inclined to totally buy that after seeing this.

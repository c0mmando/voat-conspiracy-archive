If you can make one half of the population hate the other half, and vice-versa, then they will spend all their time fighting amongst each other rather than going after the powers who are trying to rule them. It\'s a strategy that is as old as the concept of Kings. </p>
<p>However there are some much more physical, and obvious, manifestations of this technique all throughout history. All we need to do is look at a map.</p>
<p>Let\'s look at the Kurds. They\'re an ethnic group in the middle east, and they share a similar culture and language (Kurdish). They all existed together under the Ottoman empire.</p>
<p>The Ottoman empire collased in the 1910s. This is what it looked like before it started collapsing: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kurdistanland.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ottoman-empire-kurdistan.jpg">https://kurdistanland.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/ottoman-empire-kurdistan.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then in 1916 the Ottoman collapse was accelerating and the land started to be claimed by Britian and France. There were rough regions of control and influence, and it was clear the west had won, but everything was still in a state of flux.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/oren/Sykes-Picot%20Agreement%20map.gif">http://users.clas.ufl.edu/oren/Sykes-Picot%20Agreement%20map.gif</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then over the next few years, they redrew the boundaries, carving up the previous Ottoman land in to the pieces they wanted, creating the &quot;British Mandate for Palestine&quot; and the &quot;French Mandate for Syria&quot; and the &quot;British Mandate for Mesopotamia&quot; which eventually became Palestine/Israel, Syria, and Iraq, respectively. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.worldology.com/Iraq/images/post_war_iraq.jpg">http://www.worldology.com/Iraq/images/post_war_iraq.jpg</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Saudis were happy because they were finally out from under the Ottoman thumb. However, the new regions to the north were unstable and the British and French wanted to control these regions in a way that would be long-lasting. So they turned to the old tactic of divide and conquer. One of the largest ethnic groups in that region, and thus one of the largest threats to western control, is the Kurds. Here is a map of the Kurds, overlaid with the new borders created by the French, British, and Turkish (Ottoman) empries. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/78409000/gif/_78409411_kurds_map624_kobane.gif">https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/media/images/78409000/gif/_78409411_kurds_map624_kobane.gif</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see clearly that rather than grouping them together by ethnic groups (which would make sense if you were Kurdish) they instead broke them up to four pieces and separated them by the newly-created nations. Divide and conquer, right there on the map. Now we have Iraqi Kurds, Syrian Kurds, Turkish Kurds, and Iranian Kurds. If you compare the 1916 map against the modern map, you can see that they specifically redesigned the borders to break up the Kurds as evenly as possible.</p>
<p>Even to this day there are huge movements among the Kurds to reunify in to a proposed nation called Kurdistan. However the Western powers will not allow this to happen for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>I would also like to remind the reader that the British and French are the western governments most openly overtaken by Rothschild central banking, something we explored in this previous article: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magnora7/comments/5plblg/the_greatest_scam_in_human_history_rothschild/">https://www.reddit.com/r/magnora7/comments/5plblg/the_greatest_scam_in_human_history_rothschild/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We should also note the creation of Israel through the Balfour Delcaration occured during this time as well, and was also part of the former Ottoman Empire. This creation occured in a letter from Arthur Balfour (The British Foreign Secretary at the time) to Lionel Walter Rothschild. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#Early_Zionism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration#Early_Zionism</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, at the time, the overwhelming majority British Jews were not Zionists; prior to the declaration only 8,000 out of Britain\'s 300,000 were considered Zionists, according to the wikipedia article. This further demonstrates the incredible influence of the Rothschilds and their spearheading of the Zionist movement that led to the creation of Israel. 
Furthermore, even 2017 we see the Rothschild-owned oil companies Genel Energy and Genie Energy drilling in Kurdish Iraq and Southern Syria, respectively.  
</p>
<p>So looking at what happened in wake of the collapse of the Ottoman empire, it becomes clear that the region was divided up in a way that allowed the British and French (and the Rothschilds) to have the most power, and for the Kurds to have the least power. The key part of this strategy of control was dividing up the Kurds so they could not unify and potentially retake sovereign control of their region, a state of affairs that continues to exist to this very day.</p>',

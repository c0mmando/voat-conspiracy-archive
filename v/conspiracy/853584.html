<blockquote>
<p>Physicians in the Crop-Sprayed Towns,[1] challenges the theory that the Zika virus epidemic in Brazil is the cause of the increase in the birth defect microcephaly</p>
<p>in the area where most sick people live, a <strong>chemical larvicide</strong> that produces malformations in mosquitoes was <strong>introduced into the drinking water supply in 2014</strong>. This poison, <strong>Pyriproxyfen</strong>, is used in a State-controlled programme aimed at eradicating disease-carrying mosquitoes. </p>
<p>Pyroproxyfen is applied directly by the Brazilian Ministry of Health <strong>on drinking-water reservoirs used by the people of Pernambuco</strong>, where the proliferation of the Aedes mosquito is very high</p>
<p>Pyriproxyfen is manufactured by <strong>Sumitomo Chemical</strong>, a Japanese &quot;strategic partner&quot; of <strong>Monsanto</strong>.</p>
<p>Pyriproxyfen is a <strong>growth inhibitor</strong> of mosquito larvae, which alters the development process from larva to pupa to adult, thus generating <strong>malformations</strong> in developing mosquitoes and killing or disabling them. It acts as an insect juvenile hormone or juvenoid, and has the effect of inhibiting the development of adult insect characteristics (for example, wings and mature external genitalia) and reproductive development. It is an endocrine disruptor and is <strong>teratogenic (causes birth defects)</strong></p>
<p>â€œMalformations detected in thousands of children from pregnant women living in areas where the Brazilian state <strong>added Pyriproxyfen to drinking water</strong> are not a coincidence, even though the Ministry of Health places a direct blame on the Zika virus for this damage.â€</p>
<p>condemns the strategy of chemical control of Zika-carrying mosquitoes, which it says is contaminating the environment as well as people and is not decreasing the numbers of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>this strategy is in fact driven by the commercial interests of the chemical industry, which it says is deeply integrated into the Latin American ministries of health, as well as the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organisation.</p>
<p>behind these decisions we find the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization, holding <strong>&quot;Pesticides&quot; committees that maintain no dialogue with the environmental, sanitation and health promotion committees</strong>. In these agencies, the committees prescribing the use and regulation of the purchase of supplies for vector control for the entire world are imperial. It is these agencies who convince and endorse the tendering processes for national governments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>On Zika defence;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Argentine Physicians believe that the best defence against Zika is â€œcommunity-based actionsâ€. An example of such actions is featured in a BBC News report on the Dengue virus in El Salvador. A favourite breeding place for disease-carrying mosquitoes is storage containers of standing water. El Salvadorians have started <strong>keeping fish in the water</strong> containers, and the <strong>fish eat the mosquito larvae</strong>. Dengue has vanished along with the mosquitoes that transmit the disease. And so far, the locals donâ€™t have any Zika cases either.</p>
<p>Simple yet effective programmes like this are in danger of being neglected in Brazil in favour of the corporate-backed programmes of pesticide spraying and releasing GM mosquitoes. The latter is completely unproven and the former may be causing far more serious harm than the mosquitoes that are being targeted.</p>

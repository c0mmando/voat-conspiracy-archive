Right there at the top of the \'Most Read\' story section is a lengthy article about Gudrun Burwitz, the daughter of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS in Nazi Germany. I am blocked from accessing links at the WAPO, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/world/europe/gudrun-burwitz-ever-loyal-daughter-of-nazi-mastermind-heinrich-himmler-dies-at-88-20180701-p4zova.html">so here is the link to the Sydney Morning Herald.</a> So, this story is currently hitting all the worldwide Mockingbird Media outlets. </p>
<p>Why are the C_A papers running this story and why are they claiming everybody is interested in the death of an \'88\' year old woman in Munich LAST MONTH ( she died on May 24th )?  If you follow Q closely, you know the stories go out at 4am and they are not BY ACCIDENT and there are no coincidences. 
Example:  \'88\' = \' HH \' ( Heil Hitler - Heinrich Himmler ) </p>
<p>I\'ll cut right to the chase on the &quot;why&quot;. I realize most people, even the most loyal Q followers are going to reject the answer but I did not arrive at this conclusion this morning, last week or last year. I\'ve suspected it for many years and it\'s only until the appearance of Q that my suspicions are being confirmed. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.operationpaperclip.info/">Operation Paperclip is REAL</a> and more than just rocket scientists were smuggled into the United States after the end of World War 2. No way in hell American intelligence ( OSS ) was going to let valuable assets like Himmler and Heinrich Mueller ( head of the Gestapo ) get swept up by the Russians. </p>
<p>In other words, the Deep State is run by the descendants of NAZI\'s.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/2366150">NAZI\'s like Rod Rossenstein </a></p>

<p>As horrible and shocking it will be for most Americans when they realize many American politicians and business leaders do horrific things to children and worship a Satanic master, this information is what is going to put 90% of American\'s in the hospital.</p>

           I'll cut right to the chase on the "why". I realize most people, even the most loyal Q followers are going to reject the answer but I did not arrive at this conclusion this morning, last week or last year. I've suspected it for many years and it's only until the appearance of Q that my suspicions are being confirmed.

<p>March 15 44BC - Julius Caesar stabbed to death in Roman senate by conspirators. Of this Shakespeare immortalized the words &quot;Beware the Ides of March&quot; which was spoken by the soothsayer to Caesar in the play, foreboding of his assassination. </p>
<p>There is a lot of occult tradition around The Ides Of March. It goes back to ancient sacrifice traditions during the spring time. I first heard about this during the Iraq War of 2003, I think it may have been one of Alex Jones old movies where he mentioned it was an old occult sacrifice period that elites always make sacrifices. Even the Hollywood elites have sacrificed a bunch of people in the last few days through this College bribery scandal. </p>
<p>Whether these Christchurch shooter(s) knew about this or not, they were compelled by the energies of chaos and destruction that manifests itself at this time of year, as things are about the be reborn, during the ancient pagan April spring renewal festival (Easter in Christianity). Fiscal years begin in April. The state requires taxes are due in April, or else you get a penalty. They are not due January 1st, which is the start of the calendar year, but instead they are due in April, which is the beginning of the yearly planetary period of renewal in the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>The shooting in NZ is a reversal of renewal energy because it is the end of summer in the southern hemisphere. It is 3 months after the solstice on December 21ist, and the equivalent of the energy we would have in September in the northern hemisphere. September 11th attacks in 2001 obviously took place in the fall sacrifice period. There was also a fall sacrifice period which would be traditionally in favor of hopefully not dying during the winter, while the spring sacrifice was to welcome in an early spring and bountiful summer month period. </p>
<p>Numerology and Astrology are not science by any means but an understanding of them can point to patterns of the deeper underlying patterns that our planet and the universe works on. The ancient people paid attentive detail to the motions of the stars and planets and how it correlated to what was happening to what was important on earth in relation to important things like seasonal changes and harvests, etc. They observed over thousands of years, and sophisticated societies recorded their observations and passed them on down for other educated people to continue to try and refine and develop their knowledge of the unpredictability of the forces affecting their lives. This is why the remnants of the most ancient civilizations like the Pyramids, Stonehenge and Mesoamerican ruins are aligned with specific places in the sky. They learned how to plan things out, plant crops, prepare for winter and survive in their world through their ability to observe. It was a different approach to science from that era.</p>
<p>This Christchurch shooting is designed by this guy or these people or Mossad or whoever was controlling the whole OP as an international terrorist attack which was live streamed on fucking Facebook for like 16 minutes. The last time there was massive real time violence like this that had international West vs Islam on video for the whole world to watch themselves was 9/11. I really have to try and remember the last time the media of the moment was used to traumatize the normal people of the world. They did &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; live on CNN on March 20 2003 in Baghdad, but that was seen as retribution in the consciousness of the West for 9/11, even though it took place during the sacrifice period. </p>
<p>This will result in retaliatory attacks by Muslims, probably at Churches in Europe and probably America, but really wherever there are enough Muslims. Australia would be an obvious target cause this shooter was Australian and Australia has a huge Muslim population. It will be the radicals who attack and they will be attacked back by radicals like this Christchurch shooter guy. Its leading up to major elections next year in America, this year in Canada, a re-vote on Brexit, and probably military intervention in Venezuela (in which Russia and Iran WILL get involved, as the US did in their backyard in Syria.)  
</p>
<p>The US election next year will have implications to come for the next century. If violent clashes continue in America and the democrats push for things like gun control and restrictions on freedoms, as well as their continued efforts to keep hyping up anti Trump rhetoric, the line between fake and real hate crimes gets blurred, it could be chaos by the next election. Too much instability could cause disruption of the normal electoral process in the United States and lead everyone who hates Trump to view him as a dictator if the elections do not happen or are postponed for any reason. The nation would break its tipping point and shit would go insane. If the elections happen and Trump wins, the left will go crazy, claim Russian interference and election fraud and call it illegitimate and shit would go insane. If any of these clown ass democrats get elected, the globalist hammer will SLAM down on all free people in America, you will have no first or second amendment rights, and because of that you will have no rights at all because rights will be considered as &quot;promoting hate.&quot;</p>
<p>Is it hopelessfag, Voat? If we are just completely fucked in any outcome, I personally just want to sit back and watch all this shit go down from as comfortable a place as possible. Smoke some legal weed, have a drink or two with a nice steak or bacon burger for dinner each night until the food runs out, maybe find some thot to fuck until shit hits the fan and make some good friends with people who live out in the country for when, eventually things get too fucked in the cities to handle. </p>
<p>I think the fake news media has to be exposed totally before the election and the democrats have to be destroyed by themselves in order for Trump to have any sort of legitimate chance at keeping the country from exploding from within. That is the only maybe possible outcome where everything isn\'t totally fucked up to all hell. What does Voat think about all of this? When I was a teenager in the 90s and the 2000s was around the corner, it looked like the future would be like Star Trek made into reality. I don\'t think anyone expected everything to fracture from within. But I could not even go to the theater this weekend to watch a movie filled with what should have been some great 90s nostalgia because it was starring a snarky feminist bitch for no reason other then their stated reason to make young girls hate men more then they are already taught to. The culture is all fucked up like 1920s Berlin and every generation born after 1980 is significantly poorer then their parents were and will be for the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Last time a major world power slid into this type of disarray and internal strife was 1920s Germany which lead to the rise of totalitarianism and the outbreak of juden orchestrated world war. Communist and Fascist extremists vied for power during the 1920s and it lead to the fight between both these totalitarian forms of government in the second world war. With China and Russia and Iran all eyeing a potential increase in world power, they will use Venezuela to occupy the American military while trying to sew chaos in the American continent. This is all perfect timing to really destabilize America if you are Russia, China and Iran. The foreign Psyop against the Vietnam war worked on the American voters and the nation building had to be abandoned, it could happen again and would be disastrous in a country as close to the USA as Venezuela.</p>',

            Jesus knew about astrology. He also knew about the forces running our planet, and the book of Judas tells it all.

            The only way to exit this hell is through unconditional love of all beings, intelligence through experience (your own 6 senses) and radiant joy.

            Alister Crowley said the easiest way to kill a man's soul is with a thousand tiny frustrations.

            Numerology is real. Each disciple stood for something and Judas was the ego. He had to die for the light to be resurrected.

             I am the same age right now that Jesus was when he was crucified. Now that I am older and actually have learned on my own about Jesus, I like him more and more. I like some of the ancient Gnostic texts, as well as the parts of the Bible that are directly attributed to what Jesus was saying out of his own mouth like Matthew 5:44. I would not call myself a modern Christian though cause they all eventually trace their roots back to the Catholic church which was the corruption of Jesus message.

            as you said, march is the start of the new season in the northern hemisphere. when the world wakes up from hibernation.
some said that you cant wage war during winter, march is when they start marching. hence the name.

            then i guess september is the end of the season and the time of harvest. the question is what happens in between? the planted seeds are developing.

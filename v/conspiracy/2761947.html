<p>They want Trump to win the election, he sends more money to foreign countries at war than any president before.  THINK ABOUT THAT.</p>

<p>the old, \'<em>powder in the mail trick</em>\' is old fucking news, only being done to cause sympathy for Trump and for republican candidates.  Poor Trump, poor crooked politicians, poor Hillary, poor fox news, poor CNN.  Come on guys, this is literally government propaganda being pushed and well timed for the upcoming elections.  The entire election was shown to you in 2016 that it was rigged and trumps victory the end game.  Stop falling for this trick and don\'t listen to their narrative.  if you don\'t push their lies, they will show their true numbers and they are small.  We literally out number the small group of people that control us 10 to 1.

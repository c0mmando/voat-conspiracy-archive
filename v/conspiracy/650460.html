<p>If you think about it, these Yale SJW people with the Halloween costumes are using the exact same tactic, although they might not realize it. They frame the argument in a way such that they are being &quot;attacked&quot; (by the administrators allowing students to express themselves freely via their costumes) and are therefore justified in <em>any</em> counter-attack. So you see them yelling and screaming in response to simple questions, but it\'s because they\'re emotionally reacting and they are certain they are right. They are in a state of righteous indignation, which they feel is justified. There\'s no mental luxury so great as righteous fury. When you\'re in a state of righteous anger, there\'s no need to try anymore. You can just let it all fly, which is what these SJW people want to do most. They want to tell people off and speak their mind without filter or awareness of social decorum, based on the assumption (which they see as fact) that they are siding with the downtrodden. It\'s like White Knighting, in a way. </p>
<p>Even my cat uses this strategy. It doesn\'t take a genius to pull it off, just someone who pays attention to incentives. She doesn\'t like the other cats and loves to see them get in trouble. So sometimes she will play the victim and ham it up like she got attacked really bad even if it was just a tiny scrach, which leads to me getting mad at the other cats. She knows this, and she uses it like a tool. It\'s annoying as shit and now that I\'m wise to it I\'ve changed the incentives so that behavior isn\'t easy and is instead difficult and unrewarding. Which is exactly what needs to happen in American culture. It needs to be socially difficult to be a jerk, and easy to be nice. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6TRCgJ2HkY">Like that video of the horse pinning its ears.</a> Instead it\'s mostly the opposite in mainstream society. The people who are jerks make it all over the news, and the nice people are generally ignored because they\'re not attention-grabbing enough. We are all fascinated with watching train-wrecks of people spout off about stuff, and we need to stop being fascinated with it because it\'s merely empowering the train-wrecks and giving them an audience. Like reality shows. Like corporate news. </p>
<p>Everyone is doing it. It\'s a power game, of &quot;who can be the biggest victim and is  therefore entitled to the biggest slice of the pie&quot; which only arises because we have such a focus as a culture on trying to help out victims, and not enough on just empowering average people. Victimhood dominates our news, justice system, political process, and military actions. Like how 9/11 justified the invasion of a country that ended up killing around a million people, even though it had nothing to do with it. We were victims and we lashed out, and the public at large supports this kind of thinking on a small scale and a large scale.</p>
<p>Helping out victims is of course a good thing, please don\'t get me wrong. Downtrodden people need help. Period. The problem arises however when the most obvious and accessible route to power in our society comes through playing the victim as thoroughly as possible. This drives people to <em>become</em> professional victims, as a means to sustain themselves. This is where the problem arises, because then their entire identity, self-worth, and maybe even income, is tied to this idea that they\'re a victim. If the stop seeing themselves as a victim, they no longer enjoy the social and financial benefits of being able to claim victimhood status. This keeps people from bettering their situation and wallowing and over-focusing on the areas in which they are victims, which creates bizarre people who group together to create bizarre social groups, which creates these bizarre situations we\'ve been seeing in the news lately. </p>
<p>Everyone gets offended because <em>our society disproportionately rewards people who get offended</em>. And we don\'t reward people who try to better themselves enough, instead we just take away the extra support as they start succeeding which creates an headwind against climbing out of the victim status. </p>
<p>Think of all the angry customers and complaint letters that have changed things over the years. If those people were ignored instead of catered to, we might have a chance at fixing our society. Basically everyone needs to stop humoring idiots because it\'s profitable, and because it\'s socially easy. Stop catering to the lowest common denominator, the offended idiot. If victimhood gives you power and money, then everyone will cater to victimhood and we have a society with a pecking order based on who can demonstrate themselves to be the biggest victim. </p>
<p>This is totally broken. The only way to fix it is to change the incentives, which means calling out people on their BS! The fear of doing this is exactly why it continues to grow. Crocodile tears run the world. Everyone is terrified to say the emperor has no clothes because of how much power these people have, and how over-sensitive they are, and how much society at large sides with these victims out of misguided well intentions. </p>',

            - Skip to the 4th video for quicker summery, or watch them all to get a bit more in depth.  Basically, there's a line of thought that genes and reproductive strategies drive the current culture war.  Those with "K" type reproductive strategies look forward to competition as a way to improve and protect society as a whole, while those with "r" ("spray and pray") type reproductive strategies look for ways to subvert society so as to make it easier to parasitically take advantage of society.
           </p>
           <p>
            What you are basically suggesting is that the "K"'s get wise and start realizing the tricks of the parasitical "r"'s.  But before you can do this, you need to realize who the enemy is and what their characteristics are.  It's all reminiscent of Atlas Shrugged (though not as harsh).

            </a>
            , I'm not certain about every detail -- and this is a problem in social theories, they can become a house of cards.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see your concern, though. In many of my interactions, I "go big or go home". You mentioned (western) countries where this is a common value. I think it is also popular among Muslims, who have been ramping up what is "jihad-worthy" for the past 200 years. The only counter-example that springs to mind is north India, which often tended to disengage -- until the disengagers (gurus) were pretty much overrun.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure that "helping victims" is necessarily a good thing. (I'm tempted to try to coordinate your entire post with the Dharmasastra, but... wrong sub?) For some, pity is something to be despised.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've given me a lot to think about. Thanks.

              Well, you might not want to interfere in their karmic debt? (That a potentially dark side to some Hindu philosophy. A Buddhist counter-argument is that this is a chance to improve your own karma.)

              I just can't think of an example of someone getting into a powerful position (as measured by wealth or the ability to make significant decisions and delegate orders) through playing a victim.  Can you?  I think power in US culture is more precisely obtained through greed and selfishness.

                I think "being a Clinton" helps, democrats loved Bill for some reason.  Yale Law school.  Pandering to corporate interests when in politics doesn't hurt either.

               Oh yes, there are many examples. Ellen Pao who ran reddit became wealthy and famous through lawsuits of victimhood.

               You must understand, I'm not saying being a victim is a route
               <em>
                to the top
               </em>
               , I am saying being a victim is a route to go from lower class to middle/upper class. So many lawsuits are won by a minority group or woman demonstrating how they were victimized because of their minority status. We even have a whole category of crimes, called hate crimes, that increase penalties for people who attack people who can demonstrate their victimhood belongs to a certain category. Things like child custody, divorce settlements, and other court cases are determined by proper demonstration of victimhood.

               No one is going to become the next Bill Gates by playing victim, but even Bill Gates uses this tactic. He's solicited billions by running this Gates Foundation organization which focuses entirely on the idea of helping victims (from poor countries, usually). This is how they gain power, by claiming they're doing something humanitarian. Same reason the US government invades all these middle eastern countries, they say its for "humanitarian reasons" even though it's obviously and aggressive invasion. The Susan G Komen cancer foundation keeps 95% of the money that gets donated to them, they're using the exact same tactic. Empowering themselves by pretending to help victims, or be victims. This is the victim support culture.

                 Pao graduated from Princeton University, the alma mater of her two sisters, with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 1991. She immediately after attended Harvard Law School with which she earned a juris doctor in 1994.[4] After two years of work, Pao returned to attend Harvard Business School where she received an MBA in 1998. From 1994 to 1996, Pao worked as a corporate attorney at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. In 1998, Pao worked at WebTV.[21] Pao worked at several companies in Silicon Valley including BEA Systems as Senior Director of Corporate Business Development from 2001 until 2005.[12][22]  In 2005, Pao joined Kleiner Perkins, an established venture capital firm in San Francisco, as technical chief of staff for John Doerr, a senior partner, a job that required degrees in engineering, law, and business, and experience in enterprise software.

                As to the philanthropy of the Bill Gates of the world, I don't think they're playing up victimhood so much as trying to mitigate the negative images of their obvious greed.  Pretending to help victims to improve one's own image is not the same as being a victim, or playing the victim.  That's "compassion."

                Bill Gates was a billionaire many times over and had lots of power before he started his foundation.

                As to the victim lawsuits question, we live in a very litigious society, and yes that's a way to attempt to milk or game the system.  But sometimes lawsuits are justified.  I wouldn't say "so many" lawsuits by minorities are won, and that so many of them can just retire because of the settlements or judgments in their favor.  Are courts and laws too much a part of US society and culture?  Perhaps/probably.
               </p>
               <p>
                And one last point.  Creating the category of hate crimes isn't about enabling victims but trying to end racism in our society.  Victims of hate crimes don't personally benefit from the criminal prosecution, it's just that the perpetrators are punished more because society deems racism to be more dangerous than, say, drunken brawls.

                 Gates gets donations now and can launder money through the foundation. He makes tons in speaking fees. This is not humanitarian, he's just using that as a reason to gain more power. If he helps some people in the process, great. But he's also getting his fingers in a lot of pies in the process.

                  Prosecutor's make the decision to classify something as a hate crime based on evidence of intent.  Then they have to prove that to the jury.  There's no 'playing up victimhood' because, by definition, there was a victim of the crime.

                 <p>
                  And rich people who donate to the Gates Foundation are not giving him more power but trying to latch on to the positive image that the foundation creates.  Bill Gates doesn't need any more money to further his power or to live bigger.  And I don't know anything about the money laundering claims, but I wouldn't put it past em.

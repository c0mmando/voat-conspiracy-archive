            The NWO is not starting to collapse. You are being manipulated into thinking that way. The puppet masters of the NWO remain tightly in control.
This will remain so until bankers, politicians and corporate executives start to die in large numbers at the hand of a rebellious citizenry.

            yes, but there's a long way to go
           </p>
           <p>
            AND, what most people don't realize is that
            <em>
             the answer to
            </em>
            the current PTB who
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            the NWO and *want us to fear a 'One World Govt' as they've already effectively got it with bullshit treaties like NATO etc and the UN and without 'global trade' there's no opportunity for the Banksters to continue their multi billion dollar Forex etc scamming IF there was a "one world currency"
           </p>
           <p>
            Whoa! No way! That's the
            <em>
             last thing
            </em>
            they want, which is why they fought
            <em>
             so hard to discredit
            </em>
            Bitcoin when it began to become popular in 2012 and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have been using "reverse psychology" to get the 'people' to think a "one world currency" would be a 'bad thing',
            <em>
             when in fact
            </em>
            it's
            <em>
             what we need
            </em>
            ! (for several reasons)
           </p>
           <p>
            WHY? Because what the people
            <em>
             of the world need asap
            </em>
            IS a fair and equitable
            <em>
             worldwide
            </em>
            form of exchange, what Bitcoin and other cryptos currently are, but they are limited in various ways
           </p>
           <p>
            We really do need a 'one world currency' *that's NOT the US dollar of Chinese Yuan, we need a 'new' currency based on a universal energy unit like kilowatt hours, as they're the same worldwide, just like gold but more easily used to establish the 'energy' used to make and ship a product from A to B
           </p>
           <p>
            After all, "money is just a representation of energy" which can be easily exchanged due to it having an "agreed value" ,, the core of All 'fiat currencies' (currencies 'backed' by nothing but this 'agreement' but no real  gold or assets behind it e.g. the money the US Fed has been printing for a while now)
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering we
            <em>
             already buy things from across the world online
            </em>
            ,, having a currency which "cut out the middle men" would (eventually, as this change would take time, but I reckon it could be up and functioning within a year or less) make prices so much fairer for every body, and as this "noncentralized currency" takes hold it would 'push' the big banks out of business, which imo is the only way we'll get rid of them

            It is like a double edged sword. The level of technology that is in the hands of the very powerful is very scary, yet the internet has exposed a whole lot and people are more connected and aware then ever. If the internet was shut down people would take to the streets and protest to the point that it would be out of control chaos. With that, said chaos also maybe part of the big plan. Induce chaos in politics, nations, finance, medicine access, wars and with the right catalyzing event it could send the US in such a state of chaos that the order that rises from said chaos would be perfect reason to usher in the NWO. But the subversive style of implementation of a one world government is less messy and violent and is easier to control and would be preferred. I think the powers that shouldn't be are focused on creating technology to get everyone on the same page in order to bring their vision of utopia about. As opposed to a massive war to do so. War is unpredictable just like human behavior and it could back fire on the grand plan. After all killing millions in the USA and billions of people world wide is not as easy as some think. Imprisoning people in re-education camps is also something that would be very difficult and complex. The one thing to consider too is that if there was knowledge that a catastrophic event within this century was going to occur 100% (like a meteorite hitting in 2035) the push for centralized control would be something that we would need for the continuity of the species moving forward. The more malevolent flip side to that possibility would be if there was in fact an extraterrestrial threat of some sort and we needed to "get our shit together as a species" to avoid extinction/execution than that would be another reason for the push of centralized control. Who knows it is all speculation and all one can really do is focus on the change one can make in their lives and that of their close friends and family while still staying aware of what is happening still. Take care and be easy!

            I don't think taking down power or the internet will work for the NWO. They will lose all ability to track the sheeple. And just containing and managing the chaos of the dumbed down &amp; uninformed sheeple  will consume vast amount of protection resources. Then add 350M+ guns floating around to keep people busy and undetectable... and I think it spells the final nail in the coffin for the NWO. I and many like me know to have a full tank of gas at all times and a elite hangout pinned on a map within driving distance. Some good spots are West Palm Beach, FL. Not to be confused with regular old Palm Beach, mind you. ...
Philipsburg, MT. ...
Aspen, CO. ...

Nantucket, MA. ...
The Hamptons, NY. ...
Big Sur, CA. ...

            If they take down power or internet, how will they track the sheeple? Not a great idea when there's 350M+ guns floating around the country. I cannot see them winning going down that path. ESPECIALLY if the sheep start heading to their playgrounds like the Hamptons, Aspen...

            Yes and desperation is a terrible thing in an enemy.  They will be unpredictable and any previously sacred target is fair game.  If 3k of us were deemed expendable before, then 300K, 3 million or 30 million is now on the table.  Seems like a Big One is on the immediate horizon, given the number of fronts they're losing and losing publicly.  Watch your six and have plans A, B, C and D handy.

            No, it just gets more intense, people are fighting each other more and more.
We and them are more around than before.
Left, right, jews, niggers, islam, putin, saudi, gays, cosplayers. Everyone has something to hate and ramble about.
While the world fades away...
You can't fix anything by participating this mental masturbation.
Oh boy, the masturbation it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there a way to fix anything? Is there a need to fix anything?
Human organism is overwhelmed and blinded, confused senses about.
Huge wall in front, illusion as is, solid one.
Anything that gets trough the wall is poisoned, distorted, thousands of tongues whispers sweet.

                  Thanks for archiving it for me. See other posts. First we do palladium fusion of heavy hydrogen using high voltage. This makes a powerful electromagnetic field. We use this to levitate a ship made of pyrolytic carbon

            No. Cold hard reality is hardly anybody realizes what is going on. I would share but to be honest it's a waste of time. I'm in a sea of propaganda and the swamp has engulfed all. Both sides playing the puppet roles. The NWO plan has never gone so well. That is the ultimate truth. Look at the world again. Love you.

            Speak to whomever you can about Podesta's emails, Wikileaks, cheese pizza is child porn, refer to cops being busted for searching for cheese pizza mothers.   Skip to how there are Talmudic Jews and Torrah Jews, 90/10 split, and the larger portion are not Semites but a bloodline of devil worshipers that spans before Babylon existed.  Explain that the Talmudic Jews/Zionsts do not consider the rape of a 3yr old child as long as it is done in the most depraved way.

            Yes, but don't let your guard down.  It is not over as long as the international bankers control the Fed.

             Very key. If we don't get the issuing of money back into our power, the NWO will continue to use our own labor and productivity to kill us off.

             Like Henry Ford basically said, if the normies woke up to that, we'd have lynch mods at the Fed, Goldman Sachs, the NY Fed and the City of London show up overnight.

                Nah. I don't think so. An EMP FF hurts them more than us.

                  Well, I 'liked' the EMP FF for a bit, but realized that it would have to be a fuck-it-all solution. That is what ties US to THEM. EMP? Yay! Good-bye taxes and debt! Good-bye surveillance cameras, tracking devices, others' unsecured smart devices! They actually need us to need the internet. Otherwise, how the fuck do they even monitor the masses.

                  I know its by multiple means, but consider how much the internet reveals about the average person.

                    I agree with that, and think EMP would def be reserved for 'killing the shit out of us'. It would have to be the nuclear option for them. People finally united and actually winning in a revolution type situation or something.

                   <p>
                    I would just think that there are trillions of $$$ invested in networking and digital surveillance that they wouldn't just do it for a few folks talking shit. I mean, surely by this point they've found a way to create EMP-proof devices aside from wrapping them in a faraday-cage, but that all just seems like a lot of work. Then again, I'm just a peon guessing at shit.

                     Yeah those are all good points. But a relatively small force of badass combat drones    and other DARPA stuff would be hard to deal with especially if we are unable to organize effectively because of the EMP.

                      True, and if you targeted the EMP better than just an all-out-fuck-it-all type that I referenced, they wouldn't just lose everything.. Hmm.

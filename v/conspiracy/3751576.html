<p>I thought I would post my response here, for posterity:</p>
<hr />
<p>Hello, (FRIEND OF FRIEND) - former classmate of (FRIEND), here...</p>
<p>Sorry to inject my uninvited opinion here, but seeing as you don\'t seem to mind unauthorized injections, I did not think you would mind.</p>
<p>FIRSTLY, let me thank you for accommodating my English, as I do not speak Hungarian.</p>
<p>SECONDLY, please allow me to insist:  everyone wants to live in a save and healthy society.  
</p>
<p>EVERYONE!!!</p>
<p>The question is... &quot;How do we best achieve this goal?&quot;</p>
<p>i.e., no one disagrees on the &quot;goal&quot; -- only the game plan is debated.</p>
<p>Here are some considerations:</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>MY BODY MY RIGHT</li>
</ol>
<p>In the United States (my birth country), there is a very strong &quot;pro-choice&quot; movement that guarantees a woman\'s right to have an abortion.  This is based on a &quot;my body my right&quot; philosophy, which basically recognizes that -- no matter how well intended the government intentions might be -- the government has ZERO rights to forcefully impose laws that trump a person\'s right over her/his own physical body.  These laws also stem from WW2 where Nazis were found to be forcefully injecting Jews and other political prisoners without consent.</p>
<p>Bottom Line:  There are a well established Laws -- worldwide -- that seek to protect your right to maintain control your own physical body.  For good and well established reasons.</p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>POSSIBLE SIDEFFECTS</li>
</ol>
<p>All &quot;medicines&quot; have side effects -- fact.</p>
<p>When you are sick... you weigh the risk of not getting better VS. the risk of the well established / documented side effects of the medicine.</p>
<p>Vaccines are for people who are NOT sick at all.</p>
<p>So in these cases, you need to weigh the risk of POSSIBLY avoiding the POSSIBILITY of getting sick -- with the risk of the (often poorly documented / tested) side effects of the vaccine regiment.</p>
<p>That is to say:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there are ZERO guarantees that you won\'t experience life-disrupting or permanent, life-changing side-effects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are ZERO guarantees that the vaccine work 100% for you -- you still may become infected with the vaccinated disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there are ZERO guarantee that you will get infected w/ the targeted disease if you DON\'T vaccinate -- i.e., most people (up until the 1930\'s) lived perfectly normal / healthy lives without having any vaccinations at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So ... </p>
<p>... it\'s a tough sell for people who are basically healthy --  a bit of &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; either way:</p>
<p>OPTION A: Russian Roulette -- DON\'T vaccinate -- you might get infected w/ the targeted disease (probably not);</p>
<p>OPTION B: Russian Roulette -- DO vaccinate -- you might suffer from vaccination side effects (probably not), and still no guarantee the vaccination will even work for you.</p>
<p>Given that informed choice, a growing number of people will go with OPTION A: &quot;don\'t fix what ain\'t broke&quot; -- especially give the knowledge of suppressed cures...</p>

<ol>
<li>MISTRUST OF BIG PHARMA™ <strong><em>&lt;-- &quot;the conspiracy&quot; aspect of this issue</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While capitalism has it\'s benefits, the profit incentive will (occasionally) drive amoral agenda.</p>
<p>As this related to the Vaccine Industry™, let\'s be clear:</p>
<hr />
<p>CURES (medicine for people who ARE sick) </p>
<p>VS. </p>
<p>VACCINES (&quot;medicine&quot; for people who are NOT sick)</p>
<hr />
<p>In terms of marketable products, we are talking about the difference between a product marketed to 100\'s or even 1000\'s (one-time usage) </p>
<p>VS. </p>
<p>&quot;BILLIONS&quot; of people (annually)</p>
<p>i.e., we are talking about pharmaceutical profits of thousands of dollars VS. TRILLIONS (literally) of dollars in profit.</p>
<p>That\'s an undeniable DISINCENTIVE to focus on the undeniably BEST solution.</p>
<p>And don\'t take my word for it... Goldman Sachs officially warns investors against &quot;pioneering \'#genetherapy\' cures&quot;, noting insufficient residual income / &quot;sustained cash flow&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html</a>  
</p>
<p>(These people are truly &quot;sick&quot; -- pun intended -- but that\'s the double-edged sword of capitalism.)</p>
<hr />
<p>BOTTOM LINE:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Vaccines are obsolete (so 18th century);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccines are an inefficient use of resources (no need to medicate an entire population when only the infected need to be cured);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Forced&quot; vaccinations are simply inhumane, if not entirely criminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gene Therapy Cures do absolutely exist -- just one example: <a href="https://riderinstitute.org/discovery/">https://riderinstitute.org/discovery/</a></p>
</li>
</ul>

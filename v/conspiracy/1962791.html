In order to free the American people from all the following listed oppressions caused by the U.S. Government and its political arm the mass news media, we the United Arab Kingdom of Goodness have invaded the U.S.A., after, of course, first destroying all the major ports, cities, and military bases.</p>
<p><strong>OPPRESSIONS:</strong>
1- Using the Mass Media of TV, radio, publishing, movies, videos, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and more to control &amp; dictate the thoughts &amp; emotions of the people; keeping them in a state of fear &amp; tension.</p>
<p>2- Keeping the citizens in a drugged state with dangerous pharmaceuticals of the American Drugs Cartel, thereby causing over 200,000 deaths per year and lifelong addiction for the survivors. 3- Incarceration of 2.5 million of its own citizens. The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate in the world, at 754 per 100,000.</p>
<p>4- Allowing very dangerous tinkering with the food supply by a few greedy corporations, that are only looking at profits and not caring for the people, by introducing Genetically Modified Organism into the food chain without labeling them as such. These are deadly and have been banned by most countries.</p>
<p>5- Imposing mandatory vaccinations upon all children from birth on. These have caused Autism, TB, and other neurological and health problems.</p>
<p>6- Kidnapping children from loving parents who do not want their children injected with poisons or given dangerous radiation and chemotherapy treatments and want to feed them raw milk. These regulators/controllers are usurping the parents and placing them with foster parents that have made foster care a business model and in many cases are pedophiles.</p>
<p>7- Brainwashing the population with political correctness, which is the Orwellian \'Thought Police&quot; where dissension is not allowed and is therefore a crime. This begins in kindergarten and continues till death, which deprives the individual of his or her full expression and limits him or her to the accepted lies and indoctrinations.</p>
<p>8- A government that no longer reflects the will of the people, but the will of major corporation and banker donors. Government Corruption where greed reigns and politicians sell their very soul to the highest bidder from bankers to corporations. They let the citizens be damned.</p>
<p>9- Deliberately enacting thousands of Laws, Regulations, &amp; Permits; all designed by lawmakers &amp; bureaucrats to control &amp; bleed every last cent from the people, and to prevent or delay innovation, freedom, and prosperity.</p>
<p>10- The toxins and manipulation of Americans (reason for worst health in the world) caused by G.M.O.s, pesticides &amp; herbicides in the food, fluoride &amp; chlorine in the water, chemicals in body care products, use of very dangerous vaccines, and the instilling of fear &amp; horror daily by the mass television, video, and film media.</p>
<p>11- Mandating that the only treatment therapy for Cancer be chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, all which have been proven worthless and deadly, and are very profitable for the Medical Establishment, while ignoring and demeaning natural cures that are safe and have proven for over fifty years to work effectively and without side effects.</p>
<p>12- Using Federal Agencies such as the FDA, EPA, &amp; USDA to squelch freedom of expression, speech, and choice by making it illegal to mention the health benefits of eating cherries or any other natural food, thus preventing the people from knowing what are the best foods, herbs, supplements, and tinctures to restore or maintain their health. And allowing pharmaceutical companies to police themselves regarding the safety and efficacy of their products, all the while putting restrictions, permits, and penalties on small businesses trying to survive.</p>
<p>13- Because of crooked politicians and judges making new interpretations of what the U.S. Constitution means in order to benefit themselves or their corporate sponsors. 14= Dividing the population into Democrats or Republicans, Left or Right, and always just giving them the two choices that the establishment has blessed and that will not \'rock the boat\'. Therefore, the establishment will try to eliminate any conflicting views.</p>
<p>15- Belittling and mocking people because of the questions that they ask. For example if someone says &quot; Was 911 an inside job?&quot; or &quot; Are vaccines really safe?&quot;; then the establishment will run amuck, label you a \'Conspiracy Nut\' and not answer. They will not accept questions or discussions that are outside the border of &quot;Political Correctness&quot;.</p>
<p>16- The deliberately inflation of the money supply in order to benefit the bankers and politicians by using a private corporation called \'The Federal Reserve\'. Because the word &quot;Federal&quot; is on the money and the name of the bank, the people belief that it is a Federal Agency instead of being a private bank. This is the biggest \'Ponzi Scheme\' of all time as money is created out of nothing (not even paper when loans are done as an entry in your account). In the case of a 100 dollar bill, it cost the Federal Reserve 3 cents to print it and they deliver it to our government as 100 dollar loan plus interest to be paid on 100 dollars. This is the madness of politicians that have and are allowing this to continue.</p>
<p>17- Allowing the IRS to bully and oppress the people, using strong arm tactics just as Hitler used against Germans, in order to squeeze every last penny from the people. And the people believe that the IRS is a government agency, when in fact, it is the collection arm of the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong>
For all these stated reason and more we, the United Arab Kingdom Of Goodness have decided to liberate Americans from their oppressive regime. We ask that you remain calm and give our soldiers food, shelter, and all the comforts of home while we occupy your home.</p>
<p>It looks like it is going to take longer than we anticipated to completely liberate you as there are many bands of rebels that do not want to be liberated and have weapons to fight us. We assume that these rebels are benefiting financially from policies that the previous regime put in place, otherwise they would have liberated you instead of leaving it to us to do so.</p>
<p>Why weren\'t these weapons banned by your regime? It would have made our Liberation Offensive much, much easier. How could these rebel call themselves &quot;Patriots&quot; and let all the above abuses to continue? Why didn\'t they say something when your government put troops in Syria, without being invited, which is a no no and an act of war against a nation?</p>
<p>We have a have a mutual defense agreement with Syria and we therefore knew that we had to liberate the American people after your government took that aggressive act.</p>
<p>We may have problems at home, but, we prefer to work them out ourselves. What did your Founding Fathers say about entangling alliances and foreign intervention? Please find out for yourself and then leave your comments below.</p>',

            Everything you have said encapsulates complety the gravity of the situation we're currently in. I am just amazed at how they got away with all this stuff and nobody in the generations before us were able to speak up and take action. Maybe it has to do with the rise of the internet, but the passivity of those before us has made our job infinitley more difficult, but still the goal of overthrowing corporate control is worth it at any cost.

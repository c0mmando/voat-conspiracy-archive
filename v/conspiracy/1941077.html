            In newspapers and TV shows all over the Middle East, it was reported that Osama Bin Laden died on Dec 16,2001, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Afghanistan (presumably unmarked to avoid it becoming either a shrine to some, or a target for others.)

            Is anyone still naive enough to believe that Bin Laden was "wanted" by the FBI &amp; CIA?
           </p>
           <p>
            Cmon guys, get a clue, Bin Laden was an
            <strong>
             asset
            </strong>
            of the FBI &amp; CIA. The CNN interview was tacitly allowed by the 3 letter agencies.

            Bin Laden is fascinating, because it's impossible to know the truth about him. So many lies have been circulated. There is the claim that he was killed years before the raid on his compound, which many intelligent individuals believe. There is good reason to believe that he was a CIA operative for at least part of his career as an international terrorist. There is also good reason to think that he was indeed killed in the compound raid, which appears to have been a complete clusterfuck. But if so, why weren't we shown even a single photograph of his corpse? Why was he buried at sea with no cameras or witnesses, other than the few military people who did it? Does that even make rational sense? Not to me, it doesn't. So what was going on with that? Was Bin Laden captured alive? Is he still alive? Because, if the CIA and Pentagon wanted to perpetuate the myth that Bin Laden was still alive, they could not have found a better way to do it than by not exhibiting his corpse and by burying him at sea. So many mysteries, which a few people must know the answers to. I wonder how many years will pass before the truth comes out?

            CIA created Al Qaeda through bin ladden. How do you think they got those stingers to fight off russia? They did the same thing with isis when the Iraq war started. They have already been to Africa, guess where the next theater of engagement is?

            And that brings us to John Miller. I've researched the man and his relations. He is a favorite of the deep state for his multipronged abilities and motivations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Frankly, Miller should be monitored at all times. When he is on the move, bet your bottom dollar that deceptive events are being fashioned by the state.

            Look at his bio for a few minutes and marvel at how obvious it is that the media, CBS in particular is a branch of the government.

            One of his skills is theoretical reporting. For example, after the Aurora Theater shooting he reported, "Authorities want to..." "They're looking to..." "The software is used to..." Note that nothing there could refer to actual events related to any real investigation.

             Probably some kind of C I gAy asset, they were all like this the Bush family, McCain, Carter, the Clintons, you even had Prime Minister Thatcher flying to Pakistan to publicly support the Taliban Mujahideen terrorists in 1981, Reagan also dedicated a Shuttle launch to the so called freedom fighters of Asscrackistan, basically a bunch of camel jacker terrorists...Reagan would doom the NASA Shuttle to failure some missions later with his disgusting jihad prayer. Basically its the whole truthful government representative vs the corrupt Deep State who are involved in all kinds of sleazy politics and lies...most of this should have changed after the 1st WTC attack in 1993 and the attacks on African Embassies, mccain, mschumer, pelosi, the pedophile dennis hastert, lindsey graham would support the Saudi islamists they are compromised by sleazy Coldwar era style politics and failed to evolve. After Saudi Hijackers attacked the USA on 911 the military then bombs Afghans and Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia feared Saddam and wanted him removed from power, Iraq was probably going to back its currency in gold or price its Oil in Euros instead of Dollars..another case of the tail wagging the dog and tinfoil conspiracy of freemasons, jews, globalists and royal illuminati pulling the strings behind the scenes? or so conspiracy theorist would say, they also say that initally Osama bin Laden was pro-American, even British educated himself in England...but he knifes America in the back, he was already trained in how to Evade when the Afghans fought Soviets. They say Syria today is kinda of a mirror of how things started to go to crap in Afghanistan but Syria is an even BIGGER CLUSTER FUCK.

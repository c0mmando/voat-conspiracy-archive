<p>Neoliberalism can be generally defined as government policy that “liberates” capital flows from democratic control for the benefit of large coporations and their shareholders, in the service of a neocolonial agenda much like that of past European colonial empires.</p>
<p>“Neoliberal elites” is not a made-up term; they are the beneficiaries of these schemes, which have been implemented across the EU, as well as in the NAFTA trading block, also in South and Central America, Southeast Asia, etc. The victims are the middle class, which is steadily being pushed into poverty.</p>
<p>For example, in the EU, driving the Polish middle class into poverty and facilitating Polish immigration to Britain, where Poles can be paid less than the British workers will accept, is a scheme to cut labor costs in Britain and enrich the neoliberal elite. Privating Greece electricity, cutting their social services, and turning the country into an IMF debt slave is another such scheme.</p>
<p>The exact same policy has been applied to Mexico via NAFTA; U.S. jobs are outsourced to Mexico, U.S. corn is dumped on Mexican markets, driving Mexican farmers into poverty; many then migrate to the U.S., where they serve as cheap labor that further drives down wages in the U.S., again enriching the neoliberal elites at the expense of the American middle class.</p>
<p>A consequence of these policies is increased populist anger at elites, as well as a great deal of tension between immigrants and other poor groups, who are forced to compete with one another for low-wage jobs.</p>
<p>That is what the neoliberal agenda is all about – screwing over the middle class for the benefit of elite interests, all over the world.</p>
<p>Neoconservatives are much the same as neoliberals, but when the neoliberal approach at colonial control fails, the neoconservatives promote direct military invasion to get what they want (such as Iraqi oil). Neoliberals prefer economic manipulation (as in Brazil), or covert regime change programs (as in Libya and Syria) to achieve their ends.</p>
<p>This is widely understood in the third world, but the Western corporate media, from the ‘liberal’ press such as the NYTimes, NPR, MSNBC and the Guardian refuse to discuss it (being owned by the neoliberal elite); nor does the right-wing conservative press, such as FOX, British tabloids, Wall Street Journal, etc. – (being owned by the neoconservative elite.)</p>
<p>Together, the neocons and the neolibs form two wings of the imperialistic neocolonial beast, the Evil Empire, a trans-national entity involving the Saudis, the Zionists, certain EU partners, international financiers, Wall Street & London banksters, fossil fuel corporations and arms dealers – the last remaining superpower in the post Cold-War era, which is now coming up on the end of its era; it’s just a question of how much damage it does to the world on its way out.</p>

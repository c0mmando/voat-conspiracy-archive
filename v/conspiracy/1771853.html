Most conspiracy theories have a true part and a false part from taking the original concepts too far beyond what\'s reasonable. The &quot;Taking it too far&quot; part is often pushed as disinfo, to distract people from the true part, and it has seriously muddied the waters of conversation in places where controversial topics are discussed.  
</p>
<p>True: The government has technology that is about 20-30 years ahead of what we have, and they hide it and use it to give themselves more power over others. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: They have secret zero-point infinite-energy technology. They have for thousands of years. They can communicate with aliens through a hyper-dimensional internet. They can communicate with the past/future and are far more powerful than you can imagine.  
</p>
<p>True: Bush allowed 9/11 to happen, he was briefed on it repeatedly and ignore the briefings. The CIA and Mossad had a relationship with the Saudis to foment terrorism so they can continue to get funding and advance their geopolitical goals by stoking fears in the public. The pentagon was hit by a missile in the exact part that contained the documents documenting the missing Trillions of dollars the pentagon had announced the day before. Building 7 was demolished, and was not hit by a plane, and also contained many floors owned by the DoD.  
</p>
<p>Taking it too far: The planes were not real and were holographic. The buildings were exploded by mini-nukes. Bush personally hired people to do 9/11 and organized it himself. The Jews did 9/11. No one died on 9/11. No one was in the planes. </p>
<p>True: Chemical trails are sprayed from some airplanes in order to influence the weather. Insurance companies will pay money for cloud seeding to make sure they don\'t have to payout on farmland they insure going through drought. China used it before their olympics, and weather modification is banned as a weapon of war since the 70s. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: Every single commercial plane is spraying chemicals in to the air. Every single pilot and maintenance worker is covering this up. </p>
<p>True: Things aren\'t as they seem and we are regularly lied to by the very people who are supposed to inform us. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: Everything I learned is wrong, therefore the world is literally flat. </p>
<p>True: Some people have reactions to certain vaccines or vaccine schedules, and the government has awarded a quarter of a billion dollars in compensation in vaccine damages over the last 25 years. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: Vaccines are designed to make us all sick, and are a secret plot by the medical industry to make everyone sick or disabled so they need medical care, which is profitable for the medical industry. </p>
<p>True: There is fluoride in our drinking water, and studies show it does not help teeth at all. Before we put it in our water, it was an unprofitable waste product of aluminum mining and the original advocate of fluoride in water owned an aluminum mine. It is now a profit center. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: We are being intentionally poisoned using mind-controlling chemicals to keep us docile. People with calcified pineal glands are spiritual zombies. </p>
<p>True: There is probably alien life out there somewhere. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: The aliens come to earth all the time, and run all our governments. Most youtube videos about UFOs are real. Lizard people walk on earth. Disclosure is coming any day. Project Bluebeam will probably happen. </p>
<p>True: The Rothschilds originated the current banking system design and play a large part in running the central banks of the west. As do the Morgans, Rockefellers, and others. The central banking system is predatory and used to control governments.</p>
<p>Taking it too far: One cabal runs the whole world and everything in it. Everything is perfectly controlled. This world is a hologram simulation matrix. Nothing is real, this is just a video game or a dream. </p>
<p>True: Moneyed globalists are pushing through corporations to take control of the US government, through both parties.</p>
<p>Taking it too far: Leftists are commies and the US is going to become communist Hitler Germany if we let liberalism win. Rightists are hidden neo-nazis who are all racists and want to control those who don\'t look like them through fascism, so if we let the right win the US will become fascist Hitler Germany. </p>
<p>True: Our mainstream society, thanks to the media and schooling system, is relatively abusive and power-seeking. </p>
<p>Taking it too far: <em>Every single person</em> in this society is abusive and power seeking. People are not to be trusted and you must go it alone. </p>
<p>It\'s so easy to believe the true, and then someone will come along and try and twist it and take it that extra illogical step that invalidates the whole thing. Got any more examples?</p>',

He rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.

            All you can do is look through the info you find and make the best assessment of what the truth might be. One cannot justify ignoring ideas they have never pondered. Never taking time to reconsider your worldview is dangerous, since it's impossible to expect one to start with the best info.

            I don't know why you believe the first part of all that, but at this stage I won't dispute it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The final part regarding the trafficking and border security are more along the lines of my thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would not be at all surprised if he announced the "state of emergency", or at least the "intent" to declare.
           </p>
           <p>
            For Trump to want to speak directly to the people accross all the msm, in itself means it's serious. He has a message that he wants to get to all the people live without editing. Even when it means "asking" the msm to air it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The main msm are even worried about what he might say, and are tossing up whether or not to air it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on this alone, I think it is something that affects the whole of the people.

             If I am right this is  very concrete.  I think that for trump to get what he wants ...the country behind him calling for a state of emergency . here needs to be something the news media is to shell shocked to dispute. I cant think of anything more shocking then the chief justice retiring....I am basing my guess on the fact that the maracopa   sheriff uncovered this and the fact that as of December the one thing that allowed chief Roberts to be blackmailed ended.  my bet is that he just wants out from what has happened and understands for the good of the country the best thing is to leave office.

              Very interesting article.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would certainly be good to get Roberts out of there.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know how, this could be done without the immediate take-down of Comey, Clapper. etc as well. ...............Which would have the D's screaming political attack.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem with publicly disclosing irrefutable evidence related to a crime, is that it can prevent a "fair" trial and provides an excuse to throw it out.... if a defendant is "proven" guilty before trial, the can of worms goes nuts.
             </p>
             <p>
              No matter what, it will be interesting and I can't wait to find out what Trump says.

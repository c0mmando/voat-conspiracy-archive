            that's fine, it's just incorrect that's all.

            if you see both "ignorant" sides you make a "informed decision" :
you assume both side have an agenda, it's pretty simple stuff really.

            agreed, but my point is:
           </p>
           <p>
            in the wider equation even if people 100% blindly followed that data, it often contradicts other "blindly followed" data so by default in a wider equation set partly balances that equation RT (Russia today) does a similar thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            i.e it's neutral and people talking against it are often from one side of that smaller equation.

            McAfee is definitely
            <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/12/ff-john-mcafees-last-stand/">
             a character
            </a>
            ... he's the sort of person I'd trust to speak his mind openly, but whether his mind is perceiving reality in an accurate way or not is hard to say. I'll say this though, he's definitely keenly aware of the fact that there are some bad people playing the good guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's appropriate to be skeptical of snowden. I think it's appropriate to be skeptical of julian assange and especially skeptical of chelsea manning (I may come across as extremely fringe paranoid, but I have my doubts as to manning's actual existence as we have been informed about). It's possible that the snowden leaks are part of some very large psyop, and its possible that
            <em>
             some
            </em>
            of the information from snowden is true and some false.
           </p>
           <p>
            What matters though is that the leaks have made the average person very conscious of privacy issues, and willing to support those who advocate for transparency in government and greater privacy in our personal lives. Whether the NSA spying program actually exists or is as widespread (or limited) as snowden says, whether it's just the NSA or if it's someone else, I don't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having read about McAfee and the life he has lead, I have to say that I'd take what he has to say with the same grain of salt I would take when evaluating comments from any random person on the internet.

            McAfee is a bit of an idiot. I might add that he most likely killed somebody. I'm going to now dispel some of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            1.- "He states that Snowden is a ‘man of soft character and limited experience in the difficult and dangerous world into which he so willingly and knowingly thrust himself’."
 Snowden was a solider before hand and this is from his wiki page.
" On May 7, 2004, Snowden enlisted in the United States Army Reserve as a Special Forces candidate through its 18X enlistment option, but he did not complete the training.[8][43] He said he wanted to fight in the Iraq War because he "felt like [he] had an obligation as a human being to help free people from oppression."[22] Snowden said he was discharged after breaking both legs in a training accident.[44] He was discharged on September 28, 2004.[45]"
           </p>
           <p>
            And as far as the limited experience thing his was consider a rising star in the NSA, and wouldn't be willing choose this life is bullshit as well. Source
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Nd6qN167wKo?t=8m">
             https://youtu.be/Nd6qN167wKo?t=8m
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            2- This is one is fucking grand. "McAfee believes there is absolutely no reason why Snowden had to leave Hong Kong for Russia. " Yeah he did the state department was trying to get him and he barley got out. He also didn't want to say in Russia that is where his passport got revoked and so was stuck there.  Source -
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Flight_from_the_United_States">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Flight_from_the_United_States
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            3- "Since when has the media been trustworthy?" The only good point he made and that I can agree with, but snowden didn't give the doc to the media as a whole. He gave them to Glenn Greenwald and so he could choose what was worth disclosing. And Greenwald has fought surveillance before hand. Source

            Wrong. Whoever wrote this knows nothing of Russia, and this statement make the credibility of the rest of his arguments essentially zero (I didn't even read Reason 3 and its rebuttal).

            Snowden gives the Russian government the opportunity to play up the Western civil liberties violations against their own population for the domestic audience, implying that the levels of power abuse and government corruption in the Western countries are on the same level as in Russia -- and therefore fighting against that is both meaningless and futile. As a pleasant bonus, it also gives the Kremlin an opportunity to annoy the Western elites, and to affect the general populace in the West with propaganda through Russian-sponsored media (such as RT), and various "useful idiots".

            If SNOWDEN were REAL there would be REAL shit on ISRAEL; To date there is NOTHING
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact its worst all the releases have been stuff to embarrass the enemy's of ISRAEL

           <p>
            In summary SNOWDEN is an ISRAEL (NEO-CON) Asset, is the INFO real? YES, it should be READ.
Is it BIASED yes, because your just looking at the shit dumped by the elephant, and U never get to see the elephant (ISRAEL)

            This is so stupid that I actually enjoyed it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where do I start?  I'm around 40 and have eaten vegan for the around a decade (I know, every vegan has to tell you they're a vegan, but it is obviously relevant to my post, so save the comments).  I have more energy than I did 10 years ago, and I'm in better shape than when I was in my 20s.  I've never had any issues with kidney stones or goiters.  How did I accomplish this feat?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's look at how she talks about her health.  She was zinc deficienct.  Well then fucking consume more zinc; it's not that hard.  She talks about the problems of carb-based, low-fat diets.  Well then fucking eat more fats; it's not that hard.  When I went vegan, I heard all the, "my friend's sister's boyfriend's dog walker tried going vegan for 2 weeks and nearly died!" so I studied up on basic nutrition, and ate a diet that met all of my known nutritional needs, and kept a variety of foods to address any nutritional needs we've yet to identify.  Once I knew what to look for, this was surprisingly easy and inexpensive, despite the common criticism to the contrary.  My diet includes plenty of fats and proteins, not just largely carbs.  I might be getting manipulated by the Big Spinach industry that she seems to think exists and is more powerful than the dairy and egg and meat mega-agricorps, but I also eat a fair amount of greens nearly every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            She talks about all the environmental nonsense and all the virtue-signalling she posted on facebook.  Fine, but that is a personal idiocy problem, not caused by any diet.  I don't even have any social media accounts, and eating a carrot doesn't give me cravings to get one. I don't really give a shit what you or anyone else eats.  I am a better person than you, but that doesn't have anything to do with our diets (calm down, it's a joke).
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, those are just my own personal anecdotes, just like the video was mostly her own personal anecdotes.  So let's talk about more generally applicable information.
           </p>
           <p>
            She talks about the fatness of vegans versus the fitness of Eskimos.  Well, Inuit communities still living the traditional life are some of the least fit, fattest, and shortest-lived communities in Canada, so her experience of them is clearly some exception or delusion.  Who is the least fat?  Among vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters in the United States, vegans are the only group who's average BMI is in the "healthy" range, with the other two having an average of "overweight" (meat-eaters getting closer to an average in "obese" every year).  But, maybe the HAES people are right, and BMI is a bad measure of health.  So let's talk about longevity.  The longest-lived community in the world is the Okinawan Japanese, whose traditional diet is almost purely plant-based, with meat only commonly added for specific holidays and special occasions.  The second longest-lived people are the Seventh Day Adventist communities in the Western U.S., who are religiously prohibited from eating meat.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl;dr: this girl is as stupid as she sounds, and is blaming her life problems on being a vegan rather than being an idiot.  Or, maybe I'm just a paid shill for Big Cauliflower.

            People, when undergoing any kind of lifestyle change like switching to Veganism, go to a nutritionist and have your levels checked on a regular basis to make sure you're not low on any nutrients. Watch what you eat and ensure you get your fill of daily nutrients while rotating your foods throughout the seasons. Yes, it takes more work than a meat-based diet, but if you remain focused there are many health benefits to be had. I'm sorry this woman had a bad experience, but personally it sounds like she wasn't eating a well-rounded diet and was probably lacking in some nutrients and too high in others.

              Let's operate under the assumption that an individual has their levels checked once yearly at a physical, and all results come back as being in a normal range. Then let's say that individual decides to adopt a plant-based diet, thereby swapping out some foods with others. Should said individual check back with their doctor after a smaller amount of time to ensure their levels are still good? Yes, of course. When you first make a big change like that in any situation, you should definitely check back a little more often at first to make sure nothing is going wrong.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you code a program, do you spend a bunch of time writing the whole code first, run it, and pray it doesn't need debugging? No, you take it in smaller pieces so you can debug it along the way. Similarly, instead of taking on a big diet change and not checking back in for a long time, you run the risk of not having substituted something properly.

             Yup.  This is so anecdotal because after major surgeries doctors recommend a plabt based diet high in protein such as Legumes, etc.  Digestion is the biggest energy user of the body, people need to eat less.  A couple handfuls of protein packed food a day is good,enough.  This whole 3 square a day is bullshit and,meant,to,keep your body constantly digestung,and,distracted.

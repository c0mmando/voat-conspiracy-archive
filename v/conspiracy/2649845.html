<p>Now that I\'ve gotten that out of the way, I think there is one core point that we can all agree on.  We are all getting fucked right now and it\'s not just you, me but everyone.  We know the people that run things, what ever you want to call the pricks, the illuminati, the queen, the president, the dictator, whatever you call it, it  doesn\'t matter.  We are all getting fucked.  
</p>
<p>if there is going to be anyway for the people of this world to finally have a better life, its that we all need to stop attacking one another.  So whether you are a pizzagater, a conspiracy theorist, a shit-poster, a liberal, a liberal nazi, a racist, a nigger, a catholic, a china men, a slut, an arab, a ham-beast we actually have one thing in common, that we are all getting fucked.  
</p>
<p>Look at what has happened to everyone.  One group blames the immigrants, another the niggers, the liberals believe everyone is a nazi.  Again, I\'m as guilty as the next guy, they have fucked us all so bad that we are angry.  EVERYONE is angry, rightfully so.  Being raped since the day you were born is not going to give you the warm and fuzzies all over. We are all getting fucked.</p>
<p>If anyone has actually gotten this far, I\'m sure I\'ll get called a shill, or a jew or a Muslim or someone\'s alt, that\'s fine, say whatever you want, because at the end of the day, I\'m just a person, just like you, who is really tired of getting fucked.  These mother fuckers keep driving small wedges between us, and the worst part of it all is that we all letting them fuck us.  We are all LITERALLY getting fucked.</p>
<p>So, to end this rant.  If we can all just agree one thing, I\'m telling you guys that this event would be the single scariest thing we can do to these bitches that think they can control us.  Black, white, Mexican, what the fuck ever.  If we agree single thing, we can begin to change our worlds.  I guarantee all of us on the right and the left would all just get along the day the fuckers got their dicks out of all our asses.  
</p>
<p>In every country there is a power elite.  Think about it, don\'t we all still have kings and queens or whatever they call themselves now. So whether you hate the arabs, the blacks, the whites, the gays, to lesbians, I\'m telling you all, it doesn\'t matter.  This mass anger is not being directed in the right direction, they have us all over the fucking map.  
</p>
<p>Whether you are hunting down the pedophiles (&lt;-hero\'s!), or naming the jew (&lt;-me) or really fat people, or a dude that dresses like a really ugly fucking lady.  i say we literally all get the fuck together and walk out into OUR FUCK STREETS and literally take them back.  I\'m telling you that if we do this as a single unit, we can move fucking mountains together and if we don\'t, well we are all getting fucked.</p>

            I know this site has a lot of racist posts and race/religion haters, etc.  I am not one of them.  I come here because freedom of speech and it gets exhausting to only ever hear the one-sided views of other sites, at least here you can hear others.  But I just can't be as angry and hateful as some of the people on here seem to be and I don't want to be either.  I will likely be called a shill too, whatever.  I think what you wrote was well said.  TPTB want us divided, they want a race war.  I have friends from various races, religions, and political beliefs, but we are still friends who just agree to disagree on some things.  The news only shows the extremists, but we all know that's not the norm.  Most people are too busy with family, social life and work to be crazy-ass protestors.  I do believe that we need to stop this division they created and start uniting and educating. You're correct that we all have one thing in common, we are being fucked by our governments.  If they keep us fighting among ourselves then when will we have time to fight them?

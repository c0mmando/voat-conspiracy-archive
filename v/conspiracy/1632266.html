<p>This just shows that media will lie to you over the big things and they will lie to you over the absolutely tiniest things. All they do is lie.</p>
<p>If they\'ll do this why wouldn\'t they lie about stories? The answer is they do. Or they omit facts and then invite guests that are misinformed to state the factually incorrect statements.</p>
<p>Russian leaks about Donald Trump. They only talked about the fact that the leak happened and then invited guests. Crowds. They only showed the pictures from before organized personnel placing the crowd onto the tarps to keep people from standing there for hours just to get a place (even though the media had pictures from after that point and during that point).</p>
<p>They implied one thing, allowed their guests to receive the implication, and allowed them to continue it stating it as an agreed fact.</p>
<p>So does CNN lie? No, but they do deceive. The viewer walks away with an understanding that differs from reality and that is the definition of deception.</p>
<p>Actually technically they do lie because the random selected questions is a bald faced lie.</p>
<p>Here is the crazy part. Crowd sizes don\'t matter. They spent multiple days lying to you in lock step with MSNBC showing the exact same picture and only that picture despite a multitude of other pictures many of which would have given them the same outcome for a story that is really a non-story.</p>
<p>Why would they be lockstep and lie? Clearly there is a single source. It\'s because CNN and MSNBC are 100% extensions of Soros-funded Media Matters. The organizations are 100% that and nothing else.</p>
<p>Here is the other crazy part. CNN and MSNBC have investors. Many of them are everyday people like you and me. They would like the company to appreciate so their stocks can go up in value. Is that what CNN and MSNBC do if their content is controlled by an outside organization? No.</p>
<p>A single investor can put a large organization into control by a small organization despite the interests of the investors. These people can steal the nation\'s wealth and its use right out from under us. Then use it to lie to us... ahem, deceive.</p>',

            Alternatively that's link spamming by shills pre-election.

            If you are an indexed investor, divest.  Better yet don't own stocks that don't have a financial basis for valuation, or indexes of them.  When we kill the Federal Reserve dividendless stocks are going to be worth ZERO.

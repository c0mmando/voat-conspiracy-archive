            The original article also contains nothing of any substance. It's just another opinion-based article with a heavy leavening of public opinion polls to support its flawed premise that seems to be "vaccines might be bad, m'kay?" The author of the article was kind enough to point out "over 750 million Twitter impressions", at which point I was able to determine that this was, in fact, not rooted in fact. The author even used the term "McCarthyism" in the title. I'm not sure if that's a reference to Joe McCarthy or Jenny McCarthy because you could argue for either reference, based on the content of the article.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is, it's a loaded term. It's a sales pitch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look, I happen to agree that we have every reason to doubt the benevolence of our for-profit medical system, and lots of reasons to mistrust large pharmaceutical companies. But that in no way refutes the fact that there is overwhelming evidence as to the effectiveness over time of our various immunization programs. And little except for rumor and innuendo to refute it.

            I could easily ask "What's with the anti-vaccine propaganda?" Because that is what this article is. It reads like an Anti-vaxxer's diatribe, complete with mis-information and innuendo. The fact of the matter is, Thiomersal was phased out of childhood vaccines in the US in 1999.  Besides that, Thiomersal turns into Ethylmercury, which unlike the Methylmercury found in tuna, does not accumulate in the body. So much for a current link to autism!
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, people. Do your own research before you buy into this poppycock!
           </p>
           <p>
            And speaking of Autism, are there any scientific studies anywhere, from anybody that directly link vaccines to Autism? ...I didn't think so!  The best the Anti-vaxxer crowd can do is "some guy" who "used to work for the CDC" said a bunch of stuff to "some other guy who repeated it in a radio broadcast."
           </p>
           <p>
            Hardly the smoking gun that this article promised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, arguing with an anti-vaxxer seems to be the surest method to entrench them in their beliefs!

             "the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children."

             It seems as if you don't know that ethylmercury is broken down into organic mercury...which is INDEED cumulative.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Thimerosal has been taken out of MOST vaccines...but it has been replaced by various salts of aluminum--which are dangerous still, and possibly even MORE dangerous than Thimerosal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember that Thimerosal is indeed contained in the ineffectual seasonal flu vaccines. The Pharma companies say that it's contained "in trace amounts" but an NIH article published on PubMed calls Thimerosal a "valid public health concern"--and much worse.

              It seems as though you are missing the point of my argument. There has been no link established between Thimerosal and autism, which is what the article was alluding to. This is not conjecture. No amount of dissemination will change that fact. Any discussion to the contrary is pure conjecture. Period.

              Unless you happen to have proof to the contrary?

               I'm not sure. You DO have a point, but, a few years back the
               <em>
                Lancet
               </em>
               did indeed tie ethylmercury to autism. It was a tenuous tie, and it depended on the age of the child (IIRC).

                  Yeah, he's just an all-around lump of shit! The reason that he started all this stuff was that he applied for a patent for a new measles vaccine, to compete with the standard MMR battery that has been in long use.  He made it all up to be able to disparage the Measles vaccine, so he could make some dough with his new vaccine. He's the one who roped Jenny McCarthy in, and convinced her that her son somehow got Autism from the MMR shots, or more specifically, the Mercury in the MMR vaccine caused his Autism. Unfortunately, as it turns out, Mrs. McCarthy's son does not even have actual Autism, he apparantly suffers from a different condition altogether.

                   This guy can probably come here (or to another country) and practice medicine again. God knows I've met docs that are FAR worse.

                   Here's my opinion: I'm vaccinated, my son is not (2 years old). BUT, he's about to be. I think that vaccines are safe IF not all administered at once and IF you give the child's nervous system (specifically the myelin sheaths that insulate the nerves) time to develop. Say 18-24 months I'm told.

                  <p>
                   Flu vaccines? NO. FUCKING. WAY. They contain mercury, are ineffectual, and just plain dangerous. Vaccines like Guardasil are so damn dangerous that you don't need me to tell you--just look them up.

                    Man, you are preaching to the choir on the subject of the flu vaccine. It has all been arranged to get your hard-earned money away from you, under the guise of "doing something pro-active about your health". Aside from the obvious profit incentives that big pharma gets from the flu vaccine, it's essentially a craps-shoot as to whether or not they are going identify the predominant flu strain for the year, months before it hits. This year they happened to miss, but you didn't notice them offering a refund for getting it wrong, did you?

                      thing. By the time I found out about Reddit, which was about a year ago, it had already descended into the bullshit that goes on there now.  Don't get me wrong...I'm totally down with a good conspiracy theory, but you gotta bring more to the table than rumor, innuendo, blatant hate-mongering, and half-truths. I've long felt that there is enough truly inexplicable stuff going on in this world without having to make stuff up, just to have something to talk about.

             Even if I'm pro vaccine, it does seems a bit wrong to me to inject a cocktail of heavy metals into children. I hope they find a way to get rid if this by the time I have children if I ever have any !

             You mean the show up and work that part time job on call 24/7 to make sure you can afford that bread. As for the circuses... so many people wake up, eat, go to work, go home, shower, eat, sleep, repeat step wake up. Maybe 1 hour in there is free time.

            I wouldn't call trump a puppet. He has brought the globalist agenda to the forefront, actually showing the world what they've been up to. They hate him, and will do anything to stop him.

            As for BLM, blacks are lazy and theyll fizzle out. No one with a brain is out at their protests, jamal steals car points gun at a cop and white intellectuals are supposed to feel sorry? Wrong, BLM is doing it all wrong, they use cases where the guy deserved to get shot. Go find that baby that had a flash bang thrown in her crib, burning her all over. Oh wait that was a WHITE baby.

            Hillary will be removed if needed. And biden, or kaine will take her place. I think she'll pull through only to then have bill die/have horrible health.

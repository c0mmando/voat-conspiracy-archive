            Except vaccines are injected, not ingested, and they don't pass without harm, there is a literal term 'vaccine damaged'. People are so brainwashed that a nurse I met that was paralyzed from the waist down from a vaccine DEFENDED vaccines up and down, after admitting to being bed ridden for a year, and never being able to walk without crutches again. It's actually amazing, either the stupidity of people, or the successful brainwashing of just about everyone.

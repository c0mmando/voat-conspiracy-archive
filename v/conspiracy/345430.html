<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/atko">@atko</a> responded to my question in the original thread mentioned. Response starts below the line.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with questioning things. Voat costs only $2/month to operate and we are just bitching to get as many donations as possible so that we can run off to Mexico and live happily ever after ;) Sarcasm aside, the answer to your question is partially already in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financing is an issue that is still being pursued. We are currently paying out of pocket to host Voat (you guys are super expensive with all your mouse clicks!).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: our cloud hosting partner does not take bitcoin payments. We need to resolve a few minor issues in order to legally use the money (as effectively as possible) you guys donate and we are currently literally paying out of pocket but we are working on this. <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikileaks-is-now-a-target-in-the-massive-spam-attack-on-bitcoin">Our old bitcoin wallet was also attacked</a>. Anyways, I hope this clears things up a bit. I wish I could publish as much information as possible but we also need to be smart with what we publish as we have made some pretty powerful enemies.</p>
<hr />
<p>The main point of this post is to update you all, but I can\'t help but wonder, is this answer satisfactory to you? I still feel it\'s sort of dishonest to directly ask for more money, through bitcoin, when they can\'t even use the funds they already have (for whatever reason).</p>
<p>Some side notes: </p>
<p>-All the bitcoin seen at the <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1C4Q1RvUb3bzk4aaLVgGccnSnaHYFdESzY?filter=1">original address</a> has been moved to <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/1BFqer7P9qqqiirbC63KqxfuZYXxk6RrBZ">this wallet</a> (so clearly the attack on their wallet isn\'t hurting the functionality of bitcoin anymore, good news I suppose). </p>
<p>-The new wallet is the current donation address for voat, which is good (they clearly aren\'t attempting to hide anything, yay transparency).</p>
<p>Anyway, that\'s all I\'ve got for ya. Party on, free-speakers. </p>',

            So, I'd love to see an expense report that justifies asking for more untraceable money. Basically, prove that they aren't already funded by a private interest, and that the bitcoin will be used on why they claimed it would be. That's all it would take to satisfy my curiosity.

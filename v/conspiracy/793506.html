   Our culture is biased to make us think we have little power, but it's time we realize we have lots of power if we each embrace it individually.

  'formattedContent' => '<p>We, as a populace, are controlled by information. The information we\'re exposed to informs our opinions and beliefs. If the information flow is controlled, people can be controlled. If certain information is omitted and other info is promoted, we get a biased picture of life. </p>
<p>Cattle are most easily controlled with physical fences, humans are most easily controlled through beliefs. We have proven we will fight against physical fences because they are too obviously controlling, yet we are all ensnared in the psychological fences of belief systems, most of us without even realizing it. </p>
<p>Therefore, the spreading of information that leads people to outgrow old belief systems, leads to the direct evolution of the culture of humanity. I\'m not just talking belief in god here, I\'m talking about belief in the state, belief in the usefulness of police, belief in a particular political party\'s ability to represent the people, belief in the validity of a certain information source or TV channel, belief that McDonald\'s is yummy, and so on. These are the beliefs of everyday that make up our minds, that guide our decisions, that cause our behavior. </p>
<p>Often, our media only exposes us to certain ideas, they artificially limit the spectrum of conversation with firm boundaries, but then within the boundaries unlimited argument and discussion is allowed. This vigorous debate gives people the impression of freedom, as if the answer lies in some subtle shade of gray between the two boundaries or extremes presented by the media. This technique allows the media to frame any national discussion in a way such that what appears to be the &quot;balanced&quot; center position is actually biased, and the real truth is &quot;out of bounds&quot;. And it is biased in a way that is chosen, by the people who own the media (and perhaps the people who pay those people), to push the national discussion in a way that benefits them. They\'re building mental fences to corral people to certain belief systems, which will create group behaviors that will result in profit (or prevent the loss of existing profit).</p>
<p>So if you really want to help humanity out, fill some people in on this little game that is constantly being played on us. These powerful people know what they\'re doing, they\'ve been honing their techniques for centuries and passing the knowledge of mass manipulation between each other. Culture often isn\'t our friend, culture is often an intelligence test. If we fall for the traps, we benefit the machines of monopolized industry, power, and control. If you fall in to the trap of buying in to one of their ideologies, you lose. Even the ideologies that are against the other ideologies, they\'re often traps too. It\'s time we grow to see culture as a sparring partner, not a friend. Every idea put forward by culture, regardless of ideology, must be carefully scrutinized. </p>
<p>They try and sell ideologies as package deals, where it\'s like cable packages where you have to also accept a bunch of extra shit you don\'t want. Christianity is a great example of this. The teachings of the guy named Jesus are pretty great. But what is all this anti-gay anti-abortion nonsense, and why is that just packaged along with it like it\'s just assumed to be part of the deal from the get go? These &quot;package deals&quot; are a huge part of how we\'re controlled. We\'re easily divided and conquered when we see ourselves as part of a limited group that is fighting against all the other groups. If instead, we simply see ourselves as &quot;humans looking at individual ideas&quot; instead calling ourselves by the label of whatever ideological package we buy in to, we would be much better off as a society.</p>
<p>Even this subreddit itself is controlled and pushed constantly. People on here are mostly aware of these narrative control and PR companies that are for hire, that are used all over reddit and all over the internet nowadays to add comments and influence votes. But I\'m not sure people yet realize their own power to counteract these pushed narratives. Think about how they actually go out of the way to hire people to fight thing things you say! Think about how you can buy 1000 reddit upvotes for $400. That means every vote you make is worth approximately 40 cents! You could easily do $100 worth of votes an hour, for free, just by expressing your own opinion through your own single reddit account. That\'s powerful! </p>
<p>There\'s a reason people spend so much money and effort trying to steer the narrative of the populace, because it works. People\'s beliefs are changed enough that it changes their behavior to an extent that it impacts TPTB\'s bottom lines! We, through our posts and votes and speech in real life, also have this power to change the narrative to influence people\'s beliefs and behaviors. It\'s why I\'m writing this right now, as a matter of fact, to bring awareness to our power as individuals when we speak our mind. It\'s why you should write your own posts, speak your own words. Because it has a big huge effect! It\'s a powerful thing. Every one of our voices is a powerful contribution to the culture at large, even if it doesn\'t always seem that way. </p>
<p>We are tricked through these ideologies in to believing that we are generally powerless. We are taught learned helplessness, verbally and emotionally beaten over the brow so many times that we stop trying. This is what school teaches us, this is what media teaches us, this is what work teaches us. To shut up and do what we\'re told, and stop acting in ways that don\'t conform to the design of the culture. Don\'t be weird, or people might not like you. You might even lose your job.  
</p>
<p>So people shut up. Well, <em>don\'t!</em> This is how we give up our power, by believing we have none. Simply being honest and stating your honest opinion time after time, is a revolutionary act. Possibly the most revolutionary thing a person can do is to be completely genuine in this fake culture. This is the pinnacle of non-violent resistance. This is the deep change that can stop war, that can end an unequal economy permanently. This is what people mean when they say &quot;To conquer the world, you must first conquer yourself.&quot; </p>
<p>Our culture has been infantilized in to silence. We believe ourselves to be helpless confused children, so we are. We are afraid to say something controversial, because we might be wrong. Do you think the people who are actually driving the cultural narrative now care about being wrong? Do you think just by having <em>any</em> inkling towards the honest truth you might have something far more worth contributing to the conversation, then any media or ideological person mechanically interjecting their ideas in to the conversation? Our culture is starving for well-thought-out ideas. If you have one, by all means, please share it with everyone you know, do not hesitate. This is how we grow beyond the shackles of a status-quo culture, by slowly pushing against the boundaries we are given, over and over. It\'s not a single act of rebellion that will fix our culture, it\'s a change in lifestyle across millions of people that will lay the foundation for a better future.</p>
<p>Imagine if our mainstream culture was organically created by each of us, instead of by a handful of huge companies! We can have this. We simply have to act like it\'s ours, instead of being scared of standing out and handing the power of the narrative to them. We have the power! <strong>And more than anything they do not want us to know we each have this power.</strong> Nothing serves TPTB more than being scared in to silence. All that has to happen for evil to succeed is for good to say nothing. Speaking out with your honest thoughts is the greatest and most fundamental way to challenge the system. </p>
<p>We have this great opportunity right now, in this era of the advent of the internet, to speak our minds to the entire world! Don\'t squander it, and then in 20 years when the internet is highly controlled, wish you had spoken out. The clock is ticking, this is not a dress rehearsal. Time to evolve. Only by realizing and making use of our own individual power can we flatten the hierarchy. </p>
<p><strong>tldr</strong>: If you see something, say something. If you are caught up in an ideological belief system or twenty, at least be aware of it. Learn how packaged ideologies control our behavior, and inform everyone you know about this because it is highly important.</p>',

            Somedays I think that it would be easier not knowing.  Sometimes I envy the sheep with their ignorant bliss.  My life was more simple back then.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't change a thing, but I can see why a lot of them choose to stay in ignorance.  The truth is uglier than I had ever imagined.  I don't think anyone wakes up to the truth without a strong will for it.

            I wish we could start our own propaganda (the truth but you know what I mean) to counteract their propaganda.  We could play their own game and flood comment sections etc.  The only problem is that they have the means to make our stuff disappear, like shadow bans for example.  We could purchase our own bots that make comments too.  A bot and tons of proxies could go a long way to help counteract their lies if a lot of us would do it.  I know a little about this stuff because I once worked in blackhat seo.  We can also build tons of websites.  There's a lot we can do if it's done in mass by a lot of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to see a lot of crazy stuff go to blackhatworld and look at some of the services people provide.  Most of those people on there are just trying to boost their websites up in search engines, but it will give you an idea how the sketchy side of the internet works.  Some of the bots are so good you'd think you're talking to a real person.  I think about what's on blackhatworld and I realize the gov has way more advanced stuff.  A lot of shilling and downvotes probably come from bots.  We also know people are paid to do this as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm getting a little long winded here, but let me tell you about a bot I once had.  (Oh and you guys don't get mad a me because I no longer do this).  It was called Scrapebox.  It would pull thousands of links from the web on a topic of your choosing that had commenting enabled on the site.  Then you would give it your proxies and type in whatever comments you wanted.  Then it would mass comment on all of these sites.  It would then alternate through proxies and post different comments that you chose.  This wasn't even one of the best bots either, it was really simple compared to some others.  Look up xrumer.  You can create mass amounts of accounts with it.  There are also captcha solving bots that help with account creation.
           </p>
           <p>
            So just those few examples will show you a tiny fraction of what the gov can do.  I bet these bots can't even touch what the gov has.

            Thats what gub'mint tells me! To be honest I have no clue why there is fluoride in the water, and quite frankly my gut tells me that it shouldnt be there.

            Ideology, in the Althusserian sense, is "the imaginary relation to the real conditions of existence".
           </p>
           <p>
            The worst Ideological beliefs are instilled from false propaganda to the direct benefit of the imposing entities perceived interests. Propaganda BELIEVED, eventually BECOMES brainwashing.
           </p>
           <p>
            People literally believe the world which they've been presented, and do too little to question or change it. They choose loyalty over morality or science. This is a massive human flaw. Its certainly exploited and possibly engineered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The real ability to conquer ideological beliefs will come from an effective way to show plain facts contrary to their stated propaganda and force SOME action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without FORCED action, even with the most vivid examples, people RESIST the necessary mental action needed to correct the situation. (!)
           </p>
           <p>
            Examples: 9/11, UFO's. Both present an overwhelming amount of PROOF showing lies and fabrications. Yet most people ignore it, or WORSE: Argue against it. They will literally argue against facts which they are not only non-expert in, but usually completely ignorant. They simply believe their 'trusted sources'..
           </p>
           <p>
            Presenting facts which simply cannot be refuted seems to be our Wedge in cracking this indifferent ignorance. I'm not sure about trhe Forcing action aspect. Maybe force a citizens initiative vote for independent inquiry into these issues, with SERIOUS judicial strength?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's your irrefutable arguments BTW: Building 7, expulsion cavities.

            TL;DR
           </p>
           <p>
            I get the basis, that is the whole power expectation of a republic.   The U.S. and other governments are considered "Democracy".   This in its' nature means a republic is null.  You elect people to represent your area/county/state and they may ignore it.   The States are a republic, the federal government is a democracy, that has became an oligarchy.  This is natural progression for a democracy.  Next natural progression is kings and queens and fascism as one person.    We need to pull this back.

            Simply put: David versus Goliath. We all have the power to make change based on the accuracy of the stone we cast.

           <p>
            The illusion is that no one can be accurate from the people to hit the right target. But ideas are like seeds - if you have a good one, they grow much larger.

            Read about the 7 Hermetic Principles. Get high off cannabis. Decalcify the pineal gland. Filter or purify your water from fluoride, heavy metals and other pollutants. Listen to music in 432 Hz instead of 440 Hz. Meditate, eat organic, and exercise. Play, laugh and think positive thoughts to raise your vibration to attract better things in your life. Avoid the T.V and other electronics, and even limit your use on the internet, because there is so much misinformation and lies and the only way to know for sure is for you to go out and live your life. Realize that we are all multi-dimensional beings living human experiences, and know that we are all capable of unlimited power no matter what situation we are living in individually. All it takes for the revolution to happen is to have enough people individually wake up and start to visualize and take action to improve their lives and the lives of others. You are your own savior.

            I'm starting to take another look at the bible. I think Jesus was basically a very strong spirit from God who took the form of a human to show the people what they could also do, as long as we embrace love.

             I like your ideas, you bring up lots of good points that we should all follow. The 432 Hz vs 440 Hz is nonsense though, it really detracts from the rest of the things you're saying, imo.

            OPs right. We need to help wake as many people as possible, even the celebrities are helping us. B.o.B has a whole mix tape and more, he's been tweeting about corruption  for a while and I'm sure there's more. People are starting to realize there's something wrong and its not okay to stand by and watch.

               ... The design allows all (pan-) inmates of an institution to be observed (-opticon) by a single watchman without inmates being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling their own behaviour constantly.

             I think of government as the scar tissue that has developed between billionaires and the plebs interacting. Sometimes it works in favor of the plebs, sometimes it works for the billionaires. It waxes and wanes throughout history.

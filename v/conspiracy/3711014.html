<p>This article should be read by everyone, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flu results in &quot;about 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths&quot; worldwide, Wikipedia tells us. &quot;The typical estimate is 36,000 [deaths] a year in the United States,&quot; reports NBC, citing the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p><strong>The numbers differ wildly from the sober tallies recorded on death certificates</strong> -- by law every certificate must show a cause -- and reported by the official agencies that collect and keep vital statistics.</p>
<p>According to the National Vital Statistics System in the U.S., for example, <strong>annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year</strong> -- fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743).</p>
<p><strong>Even that 500 figure for the U.S. could be too high,</strong> according to analyses in authoritative journals such as the American Journal of Public Health and the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Only about 15-20 per cent of people who come down with flu-like symptoms have the influenza virus</strong> -- the other 80-85 per cent actually caught rhinovirus or other germs that are indistinguishable from the true flu without laboratory tests, which are rarely done.</p>
<p><strong>In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only 18 were positively identified as true flus.</strong> The other 239 were simply assumed to be flus and most likely had few true flus among them.</p>
<p>Because the flu was rarely an &quot;underlying cause of death,&quot; the CDC <strong>created the sound-alike term, &quot;influenza-associated death.&quot;</strong> Using this new, loose definition, CDC\'s computer models could tally people who died of a heart ailment or other causes after having the flu.</p>
<p>The CDC\'s decision to play up flu deaths dates back a decade, when it realized the public wasn\'t following its advice on the flu vaccine. During the 2003 flu season <strong>&quot;the manufacturers were telling us that they weren\'t receiving a lot of orders for vaccine,&quot;</strong> Dr. Glen Nowak, associate director for communications at CDC\'s National Immunization Program, told National Public Radio. <strong>&quot;It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Medical experts and public health authorities [should] publicly (e.g. via media) state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes) - and urge influenza vaccination.&quot;</strong> This recipe, his slide show indicated, <strong>would result in &quot;Significant media interest and attention</strong> ... in terms that motivate behavior (e.g. as \'very severe,\' \'more severe than last or past years,\' \'deadly\').&quot;</p>
<p>Other emotive recommendations included <strong>fostering &quot;the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;Visible/tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness (e.g., pictures of children, families of those affected coming forward) and people getting vaccinated</strong> (the first to motivate, the latter to reinforce).&quot;</p>

<p>This is Propaganda 101, brought to you by the same <strong>fake news media and lying CDC</strong> that are now pushing corona fear like it\'s going out of style.</p>
<p>If these same people would lie, year after year, about the seasonal flu statistics and dangers, then why on Earth should we trust them about the Coronavirus?</p>
<p>I have noticed that some news reports <strong>use similar word manipulation</strong> when reporting their statistics. They say <strong>coronavirus-related deaths</strong> or <strong>coronavirus-associated illness</strong> when reporting on the numbers.</p>',

           </p>
           <p>
            Because the flu was rarely an "underlying cause of death," the CDC
            <strong>

            </strong>
            This recipe, his slide show indicated,

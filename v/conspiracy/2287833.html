            If you're impatient about the rate of swamp drain, you are unaware of the depth of the swamp. We are literally talking about not only DC being totally corrupt, but most of the 3 letter agencies, the Fortune 500 and the entire banking system. Trump is diffusing many nukes, simultaneously. Go too fast, and he risks imploding the entire world economy.

            lack of motivation to do otherwise.

            think about it - motherfucker is a billionaire with hot wife/great family/no reason to fuck up his own life and the GOP had a ton of people that could have won instead.

            the ONLY thing I can think of that would be conspiracy is that he is a plant by the rothchilds to create so much dissent that he by way of a short civil war started by the soros side is quickly won and american becomes nazi germany 2.0

              Same here. All he’s done is polarise the left/right more than I remember. No wall and didn’t drain the swamp.  But the kicker - loves Israel. Big red flag.

                  Wow.  The author (was it you?) clearly put in a lot of work here.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It's possible that whoever it was that wrote these pieces failed to consider a few things in both documents, namely that
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  1) Jews can and do marry outside their religion and heritage, albeit rarely. That includes the women. Jewish half breeds are typically not considered to be jews among the jewish.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  2) its easy to draw assumptions based on spellings of names in past records.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Clearly too the author does not like the president of the united states, which takes away credibility from the document as a whole since the attempt here is presumably to objectively make the case that trump is jewish.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As for hitler, it smacks in the face of reason and the historical norms at the time.  The jews had already "won" - the ottoman empire was crushed in WW1 and israel was already being drawn up via the sykes picot agreement.  Further, with germany devastated, the captians of industry were already largely jewish in germany.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  for them to use one of their own to smash such a wonderful house of cards with a gamble on destroying europe and making up the holocaust for years of reparations isnt worth it when, since germany was already under jewish industrial control, they could have just sent the money directly over the years.

                  Hitler wasn’t a Jew. That is disinfo that people perpetuate because it sounds compelling. Main Kampala could not have been written by a Jew. It is a scathing (true) report of the way they work.

            Trump is the first president after Kennedy to talk about taking out the military industrial / shadow state actors that have sold out their country. (Scatter the CIA into a thousand pieces, and VS Trump's talk of draining the swamp), and citing Wikileaks during his second debate against Hitlary. Consider why JFK was taken out in this context.
           </p>
           <p>
            After my jaw hung open, aghast that Trump would cite Wikileaks live as a potential president! I quickly thought it's just another politician talking air to get in power then do nothing to SERVE the people that supposedly elected him/her.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears Trump has trolled everyone.
            <em>
             I trust him because we are seeing the swamp drain
            </em>
            - just watch the news and it's clear as day. Promise, action, result and publicly verifiable results at that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider after seeing Trump visit Saudi Arabia, about a year later, a Saudi prince overthrows all corrupt SA officials. Why do you think this happened? How much was recovered from those detained and where do you think their dirty money was going before Nov 2017? Trump knew the answers to these questions many years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Countless Hollywood celebrities being outed as perverts, politicians being thrown under the bus, lobby group CEOs, senators and congressmen are resigning amid scandal after scandal. Do you think this is related?
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider that people like Feldman and Rose McGowan, and Leah Remini (on Joe Rogan)(the list goes on) have all been told,
            <em>
             It is safe to come out with all your truths
            </em>
            . Most alphabet agencies are either being brought back in line, literally overthrown (see marine helicopters land in Virginia), and+or the bad actors that have compromised every institution of all Western governments will be brought to Justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's simply that there's more of this swamp shit that needs to be cleaned up in the USA more than any other country. Trump is working very hard despite appearances. He does and says things to mainstream journalists because he knows most are fully compromised. He's actually gone a step further and is using that as distraction and weaponizing it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh also, Trump is a well known fan of
            <em>
             The Art of War
            </em>
            . Considered to be one of if not the best war/fighting/mindframe strategy books of all time.

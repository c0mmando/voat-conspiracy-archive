<p>Objective: Influence the behavior of a large portion of the global population to benefit the wants of a select few.
Strategy: Utilize globalization, specifically communication and travel, to spread a mechanism that will trigger a response from the desired populations.
Operation: Leverage existing virus\'s (HPV, etc.) that have optogenetic and epigenetic triggers embedded in them to \'infect\' target populations with influence triggers.
Tactics: Turn on these triggers via mass media (YouTube, Social Media, etc.) to get the desired response from certain segments of the population via these methods. Is it any wonder that it was social media, in particular FB that set off the Arab Spring? And the same could be said for other destructive insurrections that have no real target other than mayhem just for the sake of it.
A textbook distraction and diversion technique leveraging modern technology and biology.</p>',

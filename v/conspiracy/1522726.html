        1. Back in 1961 people of color were called ‘Negroes’. So how can the 

        Obama birth certificate state he is ‘African-American’ when the term 

        wasn’t even used at that time? 

        2. The birth certificate that the White House released lists Obama’s birth 

        as August 4, 1961. It also lists Barack Hussein Obama as his father. No 

        big deal, right? At the time of Obama’s birth, it also shows that his 

        father is age 25 years old and that Obama’s father was born in “Kenya, 

        East Africa”. This wouldn’t seem like anything of concern, except the fact 

        that Kenya did not even exist until 1963, two whole years after Obama’s 

        birth and 27 years after his father’s birth. How could Obama’s father have 

        been born in a country that did not yet exist? Up and until Kenya was 

        formed in 1963,  it was known as the “British East Africa Protectorate”. 

        3. On the birth certificate released by the White House, the listed place 

        of birth is “Kapi’olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital”. This cannot 

        be, because the hospital(s) in question in 1961 were called “KauiKeolani 

        Children’s Hospital” and “Kapi’olani Maternity Home”, respectively. The 

        name did not change to Kapi’olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital until 

        1978, when these two hospitals merged. How  can this particular name of 

        the hospital be on a birth certificate dated  1961 if this name had not 

        yet been applied to it until 1978? 

        Why hasn’t this been discussed in the major media????? 

        Please send this to everyone you know with the hope that we can force the 

        media, as well OUR NATION, to address this CORRUPTION.

            you're killing me smalls.  Snopes is not a source, Especially when they don't provide sources... If you don't want to spend 2 minutes reading all the words, jump to bullet points at the bottom, I think that will clear things up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your claim
            <em>
             "Barack's father was not an American born black man, (aka a "Negro"), so he is described as African because he is actually of African decent."
            </em>
            Is taken from snopes.
They almost use that phrase verbatim, and they don't provide a source.  So your source for saying the above statement, Is an author at snopes.... Just that guy, since he said those words, based on zero sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know you for sure got that from snopes. But I will be shocked if you can provide a single source, Other then them, that can substantiate what you claim.  And to clarify, a newspaper article, that use snopes as a source, is still not a source, since we've already determined a random guy at snopes, decided to type those words.  He didn't types those words based on a credible source... he literally wrote them, then others use him as a source.  Kinda Like you just did.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "All three of these statements are false. Barack's father was not an American born black man, (aka a "Negro"), so he is described as African because he is actually of African decent."
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Yes, All three of YOUR statements are false, and that because all three of your statements are incorrect insinuations/(Implications?), based on inaccurate claims.
But lets say you are correct about what those statements imply...
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            First off, your link doesn't go to anything that you're referring to. I Ctrl F'd "kenya" "africa" 1962" "African"... and I got nothing.  PLease send the correct source, because I am genuinely interested if you're correct in saying that. No offense, but based on your interpretation of the information we've been discussing, I can't take your word for it, Because you've said a lot of incorrect things. Also, Why the fuck are you mentioning 1962?  If you interpreted all of the information from that link correctly, It's still irrelevant, because the year in question is 1961.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The certificate claims Barack Obama's race, the certificate claims that the race is described as "African-american", and that the only term used for black people at this time is "Negro".
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Dude. Forget OP'S post. I'm not defending the wording of this post, nor am I even factoring it into my response to you. I was addressing YOUR Comment.  Every one of my comments, was simply a response to your comments. I took nothing from OP's post, and used it in my response to you.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you want to continue to change the point, fine. I will address it, because unfortunately you are still mistaken.  Or maybe it's me who is mistaken....I know I'm not mistaken based on what we've discussed up to this point... That's not to say your next comment wont completely blow apart everything I've said, and substantiate everything you've said.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Dude. "African American" is never mentioned, or talked about.  It's implied they are fucking american because of the american fucking birth certificate.  that'd be like listing "European American" as the Race on a US brith...  FUCK, That's like putting "american" after ANYTHING you put under race.   They don't do that. That doesn't make sense.  So if OP used "african american" in his post, he was wrong too. There is no debate as to what "african American" implies, since it is not mentioned.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            If you recall, My original response to you was, "Actually, It says african."
           </p>
           <p>
            You could have defended your point by  saying " yes, but it doesn't say "african American".   When I originally replied, I was more so being a smart ass.  I knew you meant it doesn't say "african american" and I was just being a smart ass since it did say african.... BUT THEN YOU CHANGE YOUR ARGUMENT, which I was not expecting... You abandon your point that "african American" isn't mentioned there, and started to explain why AFRICAN is there.  You said it was about Ethnicity, it wasn't... It specifically said race.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now you're talking about when Kenya was established as kenya.... I wasn't. Nor am I now... It's not relevant to any of the points I'm talking about.  I'm saying, IN AMERICA, In 1961 THEY DID NOT LABEL BLACK PEOPLE AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN "BLACK PEOPLE" or "NEGRO."  Like I said, your link doesn't work.... So I don't know if people in Kenya circa 1961, referred to their race as "AFRICAN".... But again, that's not relevant.

            <strong>
             Dude. Lets say everything we "know" about Obama's dad is accurate, but lets change his skin color from Kenyan Black, to Norwegian white.  So he's as white as he can  be, but he was born in kenya. What would they list as "Fathers Race: ???"  What you're implying is that it would still be listed as African. Correct me if that's not what you're implying.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's change his dad's birthplace from kenya, To Nicaragua... K? So no what you're implying is that it would say "Fathers Race:South American"
           </p>
           <p>
            So again,
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              You are saying that If obama's dad were
              <strong>
               WHITE
              </strong>
              , but born in kenya, His race would still be listed as African, on Obama's US birth certificate, in an era in which no one in america referred to anyone as African.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              you are saying that if Obama's Dad were born in Nicaragua, His race would be listed as "south american"
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              You are saying if Obama's Dad were born in RUSSIA, with black skin, His race will be listed as "European." hh
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I don't know if that's legitimately what you are implying, but based on what you wrote, that is exactly what you're implying.  You can see how that doesn't make sense, Right?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm up voting you for not being a dick.  Hopefully I don't sound like too much of a dick either.  And again, I'm confident I'm correct... But I am ok with being wrong.  I'm ok with being wrong about believing I'm right, as well as being wrong about the content itself.... But you've provided nothing to make me think that.  I only say that so you know I'm not debating this with the goal of being right.  I'd like to be right, because being right feels good... But If I will not defend my current position, if you give me a legitimate reason not to.
           </p>
           <p>
            And FYI, I've had debates where I've been as confident as I am about this topics (This very small, specific, topic) only to end up being 100% wrong.  So that could very well end up the case here... But at this moment, I'd put money on my current position.  Jesus fuck. I need to stop turning every comment in to a wall of words.

            I'm kidding. Well, maybe I'm not... I don't really know your motives behind this set of comments.   Are you just making things up? Or were you just making assumptions

           <p>
            First Off, It does not refer to the ethnicity of the father...Ironically, ethnicity IS NOT mentioned anywhere on the birth certificate.  Is specifically says

           <ul>
            <li>
             <strong>

           <p>
            <strong>
             It doesn't matter who is being classified as "African".  All that matters is that the word  "African" is being used to classify someones race.  In 1961, they did not use the term "African" to classify ANYONE.  If this birth certificate were real, It would say;

           </p>
           <p>
            You proclaimed that anybody "who fell for this" is retarded.  You justify that proclamation, with a false statement.  So your first comment  was condescending and wrong...and your second comment was infuriating and wrong... Infuriating is too strong of a word, I just mean it's annoying that you couldn't simply admit that you were wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            After I stated that African does appear, your next move should have been acknowledgement.  Simply, acknowledge you were wrong...If you really want to save face you could acknowledge the Irony in calling people retarded.  But simply admitting your statement was wrong, would suffice.
           </p>
           <p>
            But you don't do that.  You ignore the fact that you were wrong about African being on the certificate (which was the only point to your original comment)  But you then attempt to explain why "African" is on the birth certificate.  You were wrong about that too.  But the infuriating part is that you have the audacity to give your explanation as to why the word is on the certificate and what it means...  You explain why African is mentioned on the certificate(Again, Incorrectly), as if you're first comment wasn't completely wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOU: African isn't on the certificate, so people should feel retarded if they thought it was.
           </p>
           <p>
            ME: Actually It does.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOU: Well yeah, but it's referring to his fathers ethnicity.
           </p>
           <p>
            ME:  No it's not. Ethnicity is not mentioned on the birth certificate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't get it man...You're either making random assumptions, or you're trying to deceive people.... There's no way you actually looked at the certificate, and were able to confidentiality write those two comments.  There's no way to look at the certificate, and come to the conclusions you came to.

             forging an official document is a big deal.  and is very curious why obama would post a forged document, and if obama somehow didnt know about it, who did it. something is obviously going on, and we/they/someone needs to find out ant put and end to it

            thc listening not super concerned but still should maybe oughta just stay lurked out new guy in town right here.
            <br/>
            not a contributor, but i do like to look at some less mainstream news items and tell folk in my real life.
            <br/>
            pizzagate is completely horrifying, in that it has been labelled as conspiracy and brushed off by so many people already.
            <br/>
            but THC covers so many crazy topics I will just give you where I'm at:
Bigfoot:Probably at least was a thing
Aliens:Probably(Ancient styled, USO, etc. fairly skeptical)
9/11:i don't know what happened but i do not believe the official story.
DNC:smh,wtf.
flat earth:no, i disagree
moon landing:happened but with back up/alternate filming shot on soundstage possibly by stanley kubrick
hollow earth:somehow more plausible after listening to THC, they've had a few episodes if i recall correctly.
pizzagate:is the closest anything has ever come to ruining pizza and hot dogs for me.
ghost/paranormal phenomena:energy. magnets. science.
julian assange:presumed dead.
boston marathon:false flag. mk ultra/manchurian candidate?
us populace being manipulated towards all out race war:definitely seems like it.
Anyway just getting that out there. I literally browsed this sub within minutes of signing up and am a real person who voted green because he couldn't vote for the other ones. I am not familiar to or with this community so I don't know how this will go over. That said; suck a dick, dumb shits. wubba lubba dub dub.

             They are out there, but I somehow doubt they are close enough to even know about us, or vise versa. UFOs are probably 99% military craft, or strange forms of lightning.

            <p>
             Not positive, but it seems like a genuine terrorist attack that was ignored at multiple levels of government agencies in at least 2 countries (USA and Saudi Arabia). The owner of the 7 WTC buildings also 100% knew that was going to happen, probably though US/isreali intelegence channels.

             If its politics at a level above a mayor in a 5000 person town, I would bet money thay have broken a law or taken a bribe. Its just how power works.

            <p>
             Agree, possibly used the fake video you mentioned after getting the astronauts as far as the moon's orbit, before realizing that the landing was unsafe. Any other scenario requires way too many people staying quiet.

            <p>
             Agree. Hollow earth on its own is basically jast arguing that really big caves exist. Underground lakes and bio-lumanesent fungi aren't all that crazy either.

             Still don't know what to think. Its either the single biggest real conspiracy ever, or the single biggest effort to discredit researchers, ever. The only possibility I dismiss is that there is truly nothing going on.

             I'd wager he was either killed weeks ago, or was a CIA plant from day one, and is responsible for planting false info that could lead to my "pizzagate is a well built CIA trap" theory. Most likely he's just dead though.

             Most definately agree, and I don't think it is a natural conflict. I genuinely believe humans revert to peace with all other influences are removed, so long as they have enough food and water.

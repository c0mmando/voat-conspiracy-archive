<p>Mithraists are closed paramilitary homosexual clans. All governments of  the modern type are ruled by Mithraists. The origin of the cult of the  Mithra is from the Roman Empire, it is the cult of Mithra-Sol. The  structure of modern society: the union of the cults of Mithra and Cybele  against hetero men.The Imperial cult in the late Roman Empire was a double, two-part cult:  
</p>
<p>1 The cult of Mithra-Sol is the cult of deification of the Emperor and his troops.  
</p>
<p>2 The cult of Cybele, the Great Mother of Gods (the Mother of God).  
</p>
<p>Emperor  Julian wrote two main works: “Speech to the Tsar of Sun” (this is the  cult of Mithra-Sol) and “Speech to the Mother of Gods” (this is the cult  of Cybele).  
</p>
<p>In the modern church Cybele is revered under the guise  of the Mother of God (although, in the Gospels Mary, the mother of  Jesus, is a clearly negative character, she walk for Jesus and wanted  him to stop preaching; Jesus said that not she was his mother – Matthew  12:46-50). And suddenly, for some reason, the cult of the “Virgin Mary”  appears in the state imperial church. This is actually the continuation  of the veneration of the pagan Cybele.  
</p>
<p>Formally, the atheistic  secular state, but it is still the Rome with the obligatory reverence of  the Imperial cult of Cybele, in the Soviet version – the Motherland,  and the “sacred motherhood” as such.  
</p>
<p>Women’s interests are protected  by the laws established by the ruling homosexual Mithraists. For  example, now almost always women are left with children after divorce.  In return, women create an unbearable family environment for hetero men  and weaken them, making them safe for state homosexuals. For example,  they send their sons to school and the army, where they are putted down  and their will is broken.  
</p>
<p>In return, the ruling homosexuals guarantee  women small but regular contributions (the pension, for example). And  women do not rely on their husbands, but on the state.</p>

<p>There are three levels of power:  
</p>
<p>1 The uppermost are the ruling homosexual Mithraists.  
</p>
<p>2 Average – Priestesses of Cybele and women.  
</p>
<p>3 The most powerless: hetero men, husbands in families.  
</p>
<p>What is the point of women’s oppressing of hetero men, while remaining too friendly and loyal to homosexuals?  
</p>
<p>By  weakening hetero men, they increase the success of homosexuals in the  male hierarchy. The stronger men’s friendship, the more cohesive the  homosexual team is. Mithraists are able to build successful interaction  among hetero men. Hetero men are fighting with each other because of the  miserable pennies their females need, and hell and torture awaits them  at home from their wives. Homosexual unions allow Mithraists to  successfully violate the laws, which in principle were created to  oppress hetero men by women with the help of Homosexual “Tweed Ring”.  
</p>
<p>Mithraists  unions thus provide a comfortable environment for the oppression of  hetero men by women. And the Cybele priestesses unions provide a  comfortable environment for the oppression of hetero men by homosexual  men.  
</p>
<p>Not all homosexuals are Mithraists. There are non-system  homosexual men, and they are harassed by Mithraists as potential  competitors. Intra-species struggle it is very tough. That’s why they  “fight for morals”, “disperse gay parades”, etc. In fact, for  Mithraists, the fucking of boys and subordinates is a matter of course,  it’s just their nature. This is the fundament of the whole vertical of  power has stood since the time of Rome.  
</p>
<p>For a Mithraist, the sexual  act of a male and a male is the Mystery, it is a sacred act of  transferring the Imperial Logos. And when a Mithraist sees such  parades, with rainbows, “for freedom”, “tru-la-la” – it makes him  furious. For him, it is blasphemy, sacrilege, profanation of the Man’s  Mystery Miracles.</p>

            The declining Roman Empire was corrupt. Homosexuality flourishes in a corrupt and decadent civilization. So do many different forms of religion. That doesn't mean that Mithraism was homosexual. Homosexuality was probably widely practiced in all of Rome's many religions, with the exception of the new upstart, Christianity, which explicitly prohibited it.

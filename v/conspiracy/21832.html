I feel it does send a clear message tho, as to the direction the planet has been moving, from the micro to the macro, with a subtle kick up the bum to try and get most people thinking...</p>
<hr />
<p>If a very few people weren\'t so fucking greedy and allowed some to most of the money they own to flow back to the rest of the people, maybe some people wouldn\'t feel as if they needed to shuffle funds until breaking point and allowing things to become dire for both people and the utility alike as well as feel that they are both missing out and can no longer cope, hence the shuffling of money from the person/family to buy that extra day/week and the cutting off of water from the water corp to redirect their customer\'s attention back to paying the overpriced water bill. You can be assured tho, that if money is so tight that bills need to be overlooked now and then for the sake of medical, food or safety and now days, even to keep ones job, when that bill does get payed, somebody somewhere is missing out on the basics of living as a result. Vicious circle.</p>
<p>If a person earns more money than they are willing to spend in that same day or the calculated equivalent of their earnings over time, they are then earning to much money. I\'m not saying that they have to give that money away, I am stating that if they just sit on that money without spending it, it only serves to take away from the the common pool that everybody shares in. As it is unsustainable without creating more money to keep the flow of money constant for the have nots and then ultimately finding its way to the rich persons bank account as well, where it will sit and serve to accumulate more money, which in turn devalues all monies across the board and creates inflation, again devaluing the dollar in a vicious circle. this is why gold is so attractive to the rich as it holds its value and even appreciates as the market is artificially/or not, fluctuated most of the time like oil and other Commodities in order to evade tax as well as keep the price high.</p>
<p>The system as we know it is so emphatically broken, that it has come to this. A developed country such as America, denying their own citizens a basic human rights such as water because even the utility doesn\'t have the option to act from a humanitarian stand point any more, for fear of the entire system collapsing and everybody suffering. This also, is just the beginning, as a collapse in housing affordability isn\'t far off, given the amount of housing related debt atm, coupled with almost no jobs available and those that are available, rarely supply a livable income. Its getting to the point where a basic income may have to be implemented or people will die on mass without humanitarian aid of some sort. OK maybe that is a bit over the top for now. In saying that, bare in mind that the average person usually never sees it coming until its too late.</p>
<p>Any monies that the lower class earn are quickly put back into the system, out of necessity not indulgence or for the pursuit of happiness. Also every cycle of spending has a tariff attached, that tariff inches inflation forever higher in real time while paycheck are ever so slow at bridging the inflation gap, making the earned/working dollar, cycle from healthy to near worthless over time, sometimes sustained at the low end for years at a time, then if you are lucky, it may get matched to actual real world inflation, although usually it is poorly matched so that your effort to earn money becomes less and less valuable as time marches on, thanks capitalism and greed...</p>
<p>The mega rich are greedy and parsimonious in their pursuit of money/resources, the politicians are looking to big business with such gusto, its almost as if they know now, and have concluded, that human labor will soon be worth so little that it will be fazed out and become a thing of the past, as big business advances exponentially toward automation and the prospect of near free energy without the help of the consumer. Almost everybody else, is about to become ignored or already is ignored and seen as a burden to the already struggling system.</p>
<p>Atm, no scientist or intellectual contributors are coming across as important enough to be heard by the so called powers that be, as they do their best using the scientific method to advance humanity. They are tho listening to the payed scientists, using it to advance war and wealth and to restrict true progress with concepts like inbuilt obsolescence and laws that deny people the rite to free speech, not to mention, technology designed to watch our every move because somehow, none of us can be trusted with our own time, except for the watchers and the enforcers, who seem to quite literally get away with murder.</p>
<p>If the current trend of interest given from the top down is anything to go by, it is getting very close to critical. So much so that people en mass around the entire world, should start considering new ways to allocate money to the populace of the world. Better still, do away with money altogether and learn to divide out raw resources as needed by the people and only to advance all humanity, all over the world, at least try something because that is at least putting a foot forward and being considerate to people everywhere, anything that doesn\'t promote or institutionalize greed has to be better than this cyclic forced illusion of &quot;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.&quot;</p>
<p>It just cant go on the way it is, without the not so fortunate people suffering every time somebody at the top makes a grab for cash in order to satisfy their already bloated bank accounts...</p>
<p>Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errs, as that is not my strong point.</p>
<p>Please feel free to rewrite this information if you feel it makes sense to you, and you also feel that you can do a better job. I do not own ideas, I just try to propagate them. With any luck I didn\'t waste my time writing this and somebody smarter than me can somehow use it to try to make the world a better place.</p>

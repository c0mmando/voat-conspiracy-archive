<p>U.S. President Donald Trump’s ties to Saudi Arabia run long and deep, and he’s often boasted about his business ties with the kingdom. </p>
<p>He’s booked hotel rooms and meeting spaces to them, sold an entire floor in one of his buildings to them and, in desperate moments in his career, gotten a billionaire from the country to buy his yacht and New York’s Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park.</p>
<p>In 1991, as Trump was teetering on personal bankruptcy and scrambling to raise cash, he sold his 282-foot Trump yacht “Princess” to Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin-Talal for $20 million, a third less than what he reportedly paid for it. </p>
<p>Four years later, the prince came to his rescue again, joining other investors in a $325 million deal for Trump’s money-losing Plaza Hotel. </p>
<p>In 2001, Trump sold the entire 45th floor of the Trump World Tower across from the United Nations in New York for $12 million, the biggest purchase in that building to that point, according to the brokerage site Streeteasy. The buyer: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is the 45th president. And the 2001 and 12 in 12 million gives as a bit of meme magic numbers to play with. It was all telegraphed.</p>
<p>Look at the meme magic alone in the Plaza Hotel. Meme magic is real if you look close enough. The Plaza Hotel is a landmark 20-story luxury hotel and condominium apartment building in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City. It opened in 1907 and is now owned by Katara Hospitality. With a height of 250 ft (76 m) and a length of 400 ft (120 m), the hotel occupies the west side of Grand Army Plaza, from which it derives its name, and extends along Central Park South in Manhattan. Fifth Avenue extends along the east side of Grand Army Plaza. The Plaza Hotel is recognized as a Historic Hotel of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The hotel\'s main entrance at 768 Fifth Avenue faces the southern portion of Grand Army Plaza, which commemorates the Union Army in the Civil War, whence its eponymous predecessor derived its name.</p>
<p>History
Construction on the first Plaza Hotel at this location began in 1883, on the site of the New York Skating Club. The builders ran out of money, and the New York Life Insurance Company foreclosed and hired the most-celebrated architects of the era, McKim, Mead &amp; White, to complete the hotel, which finally opened on October 1, 1890.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent that the first hotel was far too small, and it was demolished in 1905. A new and larger Plaza Hotel, a French Renaissance château-style building designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, was constructed in twenty-seven months at a cost of $12.5 million, opening to the public on October 1, 1907. When the hotel opened, a room at the Plaza Hotel was only $2.50 per night, the equivalent of $65.66 in 2017. The same room cost over $1,000 per night in 2001. The hotel proved so popular that a huge 300-room annex was added to the hotel along 58th Street from 1920-1921.</p>
<p>Conrad Hilton bought the Plaza Hotel for $7.4 million in October 1943 (equivalent to $105 million in 2017) and spent $6 million (equivalent to $84.9 million in 2017) refurbishing it. Hilton sold the hotel ten years later, in 1953, to Boston industrialist A.M. &quot;Sonny&quot; Sonnabend for $16 million. Hilton sold the Plaza to raise funds for construction of the Beverly Hilton, but immediately leased the Plaza back for two and a half years, and then another four when that lease expired. Sonnabend became president of The Childs Company, a national restaurant chain, two years later, and Childs purchased The Plaza on November 18, 1955 for $6.2 million in stock (equivalent to $57.8 million in 2017). Childs had partnered in the development of the neighboring Savoy-Plaza Hotel, (now the site of the General Motors Building). Sonnabend created the Hotel Corporation of America (HCA) in 1956, to leverage tax losses from Childs. HCA assumed management of the Plaza from Hilton in January 1960. HCA changed its name to Sonesta International Hotels in 1970. Sonesta sold the Plaza to Western International Hotels in 1975 for $25 million (equivalent to $114 million in 2017). Western International changed its name to Westin Hotels in 1980.</p>
<p>Westin sold The Plaza to Donald Trump for $390 million on March 27, 1988 (equivalent to $807 million in 2017). Trump commented on his purchase in a full-page open letter in The New York Times: &quot;I haven\'t purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece – the Mona Lisa. For the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal that was not economic – for I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes.&quot; Trump installed his wife, Ivana Trump, as the hotel\'s president. After $50 million in renovations, the hotel was earning a healthy operating income, but not enough to make the payments on its heavy debt load. Trump made plans to pay off the hotel\'s debt by selling off many of its units as condominiums. A deal was instead reached for the Plaza\'s creditors, a group of banks led by Citibank, to take a 49 percent stake in the hotel in exchange for forgiveness of $250 million in debt and an interest rate reduction. The agreement was submitted as a prepackaged bankruptcy in November 1992.</p>
<p>In 1995, CDL Hotels International and Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal purchased a controlling stake in the Plaza in a deal that valued it at $325 million (equivalent to $522 million in 2017).</p>
<p>The hotel was sold in 2004 for $675 million (equivalent to $875 million in 2017) to Israeli-owned Manhattan-based developer, El Ad Properties. El Ad bought the hotel with plans of adding residential and commercial sections. Since the Plaza Hotel is a New York landmark, Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction management company hired to complete the renovations and conversions, had to comply with landmark regulations. El Ad temporarily closed the Plaza Hotel on April 30, 2005, for extensive renovations costing $450 million. Beginning May 2005, the Plaza Hotel\'s contents were available to the public via a liquidation sale.</p>
<p>The hotel reopened on March 1, 2008, offering 282 hotel rooms and 152 private condominium units; it is managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Diamond retailer Lev Leviev put in the first bid for a Plaza apartment at $10 million. Most of the condominium units are usually empty, used as pieds-à-terre by their wealthy owners.</p>
<p>In November 2008, the Plaza Hotel unveiled its retail collection, an underground mall featuring luxury brands such as Vertu and Demel Bakery (closed as of March 2010), an Austrian-owned business. In 2010, the Plaza Food Hall opened in the underground mall, anchored by The Todd English Food Hall in collaboration with Chef Todd English.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2012, India\'s business group Sahara India Pariwar agreed to buy a 75 percent controlling stake for $570 million from El Ad Properties. The stake included 100 of the Plaza\'s 150 hotel-condominium units and a retail portion that included the Oak Room bar.</p>
<p>In August 2014, Sahara\'s Subrata Roy announced he was seeking a buyer for his company\'s majority stake in the Plaza, along with similar stakes in the Dream Hotel in New York and the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. A $4 billion price tag was placed on the Plaza stake. Speculation that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei would be the buyer was quashed by the sultan.</p>
<p>In 2016, Saudi businessman Al-Waleed bin Talal, who already controlled a 50 percent stake in the building\'s hotel, restaurant, and retail portion through his Kingdom Holding Company, partnered with the Qatar Investment Authority to purchase the hotel, but the deal fell through. He partnered again in 2017 with Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation in another attempt to purchase control of the structure. In May 2018, the Sahara Group announced it had finalized a deal with Shahal M. Khan, founder of Dubai-based White City Ventures, and Kamran Hakim of the Hakim Organization to buy a majority share of the hotel for $600 million. That deal was expected to close on June 25, 2018.</p>
<p>October 2018, Qatar\'s Katara Hospitality\'s chairman His Excellency Sheikh Nawaf Al-Thani, announced the expansion of its global portfolio with the acquisition of The Plaza. </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           Conrad Hilton bought the Plaza Hotel for $7.4 million in October 1943 (equivalent to $105 million in 2017) and spent $6 million (equivalent to $84.9 million in 2017) refurbishing it. Hilton sold the hotel ten years later, in 1953, to Boston industrialist A.M. "Sonny" Sonnabend for $16 million. Hilton sold the Plaza to raise funds for construction of the Beverly Hilton, but immediately leased the Plaza back for two and a half years, and then another four when that lease expired.

Sonnabend created the Hotel Corporation of America (HCA) in 1956, to leverage tax losses from Childs. HCA assumed management of the Plaza from Hilton in January 1960. HCA changed its name to Sonesta International Hotels in 1970. Sonesta sold the Plaza to Western International Hotels in 1975 for $25 million (equivalent to $114 million in 2017). Western International changed its name to Westin Hotels in 1980.
          </p>
          <p>
           Westin sold The Plaza to Donald Trump for $390 million on March 27, 1988 (equivalent to $807 million in 2017). Trump commented on his purchase in a full-page open letter in The New York Times: "I haven't purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece – the Mona Lisa.

           In 1995, CDL Hotels International and Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal purchased a controlling stake in the Plaza in a deal that valued it at $325 million (equivalent to $522 million in 2017).
          </p>
          <p>
           The hotel was sold in 2004 for $675 million (equivalent to $875 million in 2017) to Israeli-owned Manhattan-based developer, El Ad Properties. El Ad bought the hotel with plans of adding residential and commercial sections. Since the Plaza Hotel is a New York landmark, Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction management company hired to complete the renovations and conversions, had to comply with landmark regulations.

Diamond retailer Lev Leviev put in the first bid for a Plaza apartment at $10 million. Most of the condominium units are usually empty, used as pieds-à-terre by their wealthy owners.

           In November 2008, the Plaza Hotel unveiled its retail collection, an underground mall featuring luxury brands such as Vertu and Demel Bakery (closed as of March 2010), an Austrian-owned business. In 2010, the Plaza Food Hall opened in the underground mall, anchored by The Todd English Food Hall in collaboration with Chef Todd English.

           On July 31, 2012, India's business group Sahara India Pariwar agreed to buy a 75 percent controlling stake for $570 million from El Ad Properties. The stake included 100 of the Plaza's 150 hotel-condominium units and a retail portion that included the Oak Room bar.

           In August 2014, Sahara's Subrata Roy announced he was seeking a buyer for his company's majority stake in the Plaza, along with similar stakes in the Dream Hotel in New York and the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. A $4 billion price tag was placed on the Plaza stake. Speculation that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei would be the buyer was quashed by the sultan.

           In 2016, Saudi businessman Al-Waleed bin Talal, who already controlled a 50 percent stake in the building's hotel, restaurant, and retail portion through his Kingdom Holding Company, partnered with the Qatar Investment Authority to purchase the hotel, but the deal fell through. He partnered again in 2017 with Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation in another attempt to purchase control of the structure. In May 2018, the Sahara Group announced it had finalized a deal with Shahal M. Khan, founder of Dubai-based White City Ventures, and Kamran Hakim of the Hakim Organization to buy a majority share of the hotel for $600 million. That deal was expected to close on June 25, 2018.

           October 2018, Qatar's Katara Hospitality's chairman His Excellency Sheikh Nawaf Al-Thani, announced the expansion of its global portfolio with the acquisition of The Plaza.

            Second time the government tried blocking my internet, phone, and even cable because you fear what i say. You must want to trigger the Streisand effect and prove me right by blocking me a second time you prove what i say to be truth because you are blocking my internet and phone and cable and fear what i have to say.

            The news, LVMPD, LVPD, LV FBI, FBI, government are lying and covering everything up. So is this what you want for we the people? To be put at risk? You're clearly not doing your jobs. What are they hiding? What are you hiding? Based on Las Vegas police captain James LaRochelle running away with evidence from the Las Vegas police evidence locker after Paddocks home was broken into while under police and federal law enforcement surveillance and while a federal and criminal investigation was ongoing we demand Las Vegas police captain James LaRochelle be subpoena'd. The Las Vegas police and FBI are covering something up and the government keeps blocking my internet, phone, cable today so you fear what i say because you fear i'm right.

            Bill Gates owns Four Seasons and Paddock used a Microsoft account. Hmm. Al-Waleed bin Talal owns Trump and Adnan and Jamal are involved. I wonder if Adnan dying in June 6 2017 had something to do with the shooting. Or they killed him? It's possible the account is a spoof account sealing Paddocks fake and incriminating and framing him.

            Vegas shooting live video - tarrzaan. Watch and listen you clearly hear overlapping sound and fire and multiple weapons firing at once.

            Stephen Paddock knew what he was doing when he sent those emails to Central Park 4804. Advertising his guns for sale. His guns were for sale to either dirty cops, spies, feds, dirty cops in our own government like James LaRochelle or Saudis. Are all those people dead because of dirty cops, feds, spies, Saudis, Trump? Trump has given our police officers, feds, spies, mercenaries a free blank check to mass shoot Americans like they fucking did in Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Parkland and get away with it. Hey Q anon fuck you in your cunt. Stephen Paddock sold his guns to the real killers and the real killers have something to do with Central Park 4804 and the Plaza Hotel. And they have something to do with Saudis and Donald Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Beilman lived in Fairport New York New York is where Central Park and the Plaza Hotel are. John Beilman made the type of devices the exact devices found in room 32-135 and 32-134 and 29-134. A military phone for black ops used by the CIA or FBI or NSA and i'm willing to bet when Stephen Paddock sent those emails on July 6 2017 John Beilman intercepted the emails or they went right to John Beilman and Paddock who probably along with his Flip girlfriend were feds so that is why they had the device or the feds and spies who were in the room had the devices from John Beilman. Stephen Paddock was a fed and so was his girlfriend and the military comms device and cameras and some of the electronic hardware came from John Beilman. How much you wanna bet LaRochelle stole a mil op phone from Paddocks home and took it and the guns to the ATF in AZ to be destroyed to cover up for the federal agents, cops, Saudis, spies or Paddock and Danley who shot up Las Vegas.
           </p>
           <p>
            Face it we've had True Pundit prove Marilou Danley was a FBI informant and we've had a LVPD cop on 4chan say Las Vegas shooting was something like gun walking operation fast and furious like under Eric Holder and we've had the same LVPD 4chan cop post and say Stephen Paddock was an FBI agent and the LVPD cop said Saudi Arabia was involved in the Las Vegas shooting. The FBI either sold weapons to Saudis to get Vegas shot up or the FBI shot up Vegas which is it? And the LVPD destroyed evidence James LaRochelle destroyed evidence of the feds, spies, mercenaries, cops, Saudis involvement in setting up and committing the Vegas shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why did John Beilman post on 4chan? That was him what was that all about? Well the FBI/NYPD killed him so oh yeah that was the FBI/NYPD who killed him just like what happened to Seth Rich and you know how Donald Trump is the police brutality president he loves when police break the law and rapes and murders Americans even alt right republican conservative Christian Americans he and the cops hate us and want us dead. The police and FBI killed every witness who saw helicopter shooters and multiple shooters. Why are the FBI and cops shooting and killing us? Donald Trump told those feds and cops to do it and kill all witnesses like he killed Jamal Khashoggi to cover his ass his cops ass and his Saudis ass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Law enforcement and this government are engaged in civil war with we the people and are responsible for the systematic torture, genocide, murder, slaughter of Americans this is it the US government and feds and cops have started to shoot and kill us so we need to fight back.

            Jamal Khashoggi's murder tells me the death of Princess Diana had something to do with her lover, Dodi Fayed. The Saudis did it. They killed Diana and Dodi. Those Saudi bastards lobbied Trump so no one could sue Saudi Arabia for 9/11. Those bastards did 9/11, Las Vegas, Princess Diana, and god knows what else.

            I agree with am parts of what you say, but not the tracking chip part. Those are expensive and only last awhile. If something is tracked the larger collars are used so they can carry the battery.

            Never underestimate the value of good binos, and donâ€™t dress like a hunter. Lastly, once they know you, they know you.

             they aren't gps but it doesn the same thing. with a high powered transmitter they can read them from quite far away especially out in the country without so many wifi routers...

            Buffalo were eradicated by the elite to exterminate the indians. Paid a dollar per hide and 3 dollars for 5 gallons of blood. That was big money in 1880. Citizens risked death from wild indians in the western territories, after the decimation of tribes the army moved in to protect settlers.

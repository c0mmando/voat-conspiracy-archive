            Yesterday a high school science teacher told me he wished A.I. would hurry up and take over so the earth's resources could be more rationally allocated, and so "crazy people could be controlled".  He was serious.

            Yeah, not really. There was not really a need to bring up guns or weapons in general, except to say that people will need to defend themselves against what appears to be a readily encroaching police apparatus, if not from each other when the SHTF. Most anti-weapon idealoges will typically invoke the "you cant shoot a tank with a pistol" argument in hopes to win. Fact is, one tank does not stand a chance against 100 people...

            The US isn't alone in this decline - what we are seeing is the accelerated decline of the western banking cartels and their illusionary world. The model that was built up since the early 1900's with fiat currency and world banking is unsustainable and will eventually collapse. This is the important part: when it collapses, the people need to be ready to take the reigns and change the course else another tyrannical and suicidal/insane power cartel will take it back and continue the status quo (or worse - outright enslave us).

             this why the media is focusing on the racial tensions in the country and everything else that might separate us with an economic collapse at hand.Polarizing people to the extremes is their agenda, they do not want a populace that is in accordance with one another.

            Some of the articles that get linked here, or to reddit are really poor. Yes the sentiment may be 100% correct, but the way it's presented and 'backed up'[sic] are horrible. It really does very little to spread the ideas that the writer/site holds.

             Been thinking about this - the "quality" of the article, or the media source is debatable in all cases.  Posting an article does not mean one agrees, disagrees, or has any opinion whatsoever about it.  The diversity of sources is beneficial imo and let the reader determine what suits their taste, or confirms their own bias.  Posting outside of one's own ideas about what's right, wrong, accurate, or not is a way to lessen the effect of confirmation bias and makes this site more interesting, again imo.  Let the discussion assist readers in their own search for "truth" whatever the heck that is.

            The US is massively broken at multiple levels, but so are most democracies after a generation. The EU isn't a pillar of purity on any front on that regard. As for the shootings, the US is flooded with guns so it's like a fish tank with a load of lead paint chucked into it, hostile to life but not so much that it just kills everything, it just makes the system more hostile and death more likely. The outcome of this is high suicide rates and shooting incidents, if a country were to fill itself up with knifes and blades to the point that every person who earned enough to get a few and then hand them on to the kids or just lose them somewhere, you'd get a massive amount of stabbings and deadly weapon incidents after a few years of entropy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US is in decline as a nation, not because of outside pressure but because of a steadily more upset populace to the point where the most common opinion is they love their country but hate their leaders. This isn't helped by the plutocracy. This has played out countless times on a wide array of civilisations and city states and fiefdoms and tribes, it just leads to civil unrest and then either fracture into several entities or complete collapse and conquest from an outside power. Pretending that this couldn't happen or isn't is just childish, humans haven't drastically changed their instincts in the last 4000 years. It'll play out like it always has, except this time we have global climate shift and nuclear warheads which are the only new things on the board and even the climate change is an old hand at this stage.

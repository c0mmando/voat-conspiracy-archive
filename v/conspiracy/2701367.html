            He keeps saying everybody has heard of this, but not I. I hadn't heard of it. To me this shouldn't be so much called a fraudulent documentary as much as a poorly produced educational video. If somebody wants to teach something, perhaps something true or false, perhaps knowing whether it's true or false or perhaps not, they may create a video that demonstrates the principle to the best of their ability. To me this educational video is something akin to an animated educational video. Yeah, the animation may be fake, but the child assumes that the creators are knowledgeable and telling the truth, so they take it as a truth. Yeah, the educational video is a bit more dishonest, but it's dishonest in a similar sorta way. Do lemmings do this suicide thing out in nature? I have no clue. Did the producers or whomever believe that they really do it? I don't know, probably? Maybe they were honestly trying to teach what they believe happens in nature, or perhaps they were trying to teach the metaphorical principle of lemmings while perhaps understanding or not understanding the true nature of lemmings, whatever that may be.

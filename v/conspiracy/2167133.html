LAS VEGAS POLICE RADIO TRANSCRIPTION STARTING AT:
22:08
            <strong>
             NOTICE
            </strong>
            For the record, I am in no way “suicidal”. I am not a member of any “organizations”. All my friends and family know I am of sound mind.
This is not a “word for word” transcription. I do not claim to know police jargon or know the city of Las Vegas, so there may be misspellings of locations, streets, etc. This is by all means a ROUGH transcript.  Some irrelevant information has been left out, but I can assure you that NO IMPORTANT INFORMATION IS OMITTED.  Every point is a “new voice” on the radio even though it may be the same officer. Again, this is not a WORD FOR WORD transcript of EVERY SINGLE WORD SAID in this hour of broadcasting. I don’t have the patience for that shit, so this is what you get. My personal comments are ALWAYS in ( ) or [ ].
 Here we go.

            Sorry pages are out of order, but you don't know the weird problems I have been having with my phone tonight. I think I am being watched. (After a little research, I figured out one of my phone's developer options was checked and it was wreaking havok on websites. Paranoia? You fucking bet I am paranoid.)

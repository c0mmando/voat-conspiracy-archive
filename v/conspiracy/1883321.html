            Nah, you are talking about MK Ultra mind control which is more advanced conspiracy level material than simply faking a shooting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The situations must be controlled, which is impossible if all faith is put in one guy who also is a liability if he gets caught to divulge who put him up to the task.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most importantly, if there were real victims we wouldn't see a complete lack of evidence of the attack or any real injuries or deaths. They would use the evidence in a convincing way, whereas with this event again we don't see any hard evidence it even happened.

            I'd love to meet a friendly psychoanalyst who could entertain this as an idea and try to describe the pathology. We know from

             I didn't say it had to be, I said it looks like one and gave examples why.
            </p>
            <p>
             A PA announcer does not and would not intentionally deceive patrons by feeding them false information, and in this case a fast exit from the arena would be warranted, not prevented.
            </p>
            <p>
             To answer the question of how the hell I know, well I have studied all or at least most of the terror attacks of recent years to make that declaration with confidence. Of course it's a tentative conclusion -- I'll gladly admit I'm wrong if there's a reason to think otherwise, but if you study these events in detail you see patterns emerge and similarities among them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's been almost a day since the event here. I am still able to buy tickets for that arena for a show Thursday, despite the crime scene and biohazard that would result from 22 people being blown to bits and dozens being maimed, and have still not seen good evidence of any explosion or any real injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kind of reminds me of the fake bombs that went off outside that soccer game in relation to the fake Bataclan hoax -- of course you might think that was a real Muslim terror attack.

            There you go. How? How do you do this? Contrary to the stereotype of the "lone wolf jihadist" we have come to know, most people do have a sense of self-preservation and do not wish to blow themselves up.  In other words people want to live.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, very simply put, these things need to be controlled and if you fake everything you can control it. Whereas you never know if some deranged suicide bomber you somehow get to agree to this is going to succeed. He might be taken out by security before he even kills anyone, and he could -- and would -- rat you out as the party who put him up to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing I always say in response to your sentiments is this: Why be guilty of murder or a murder plot when you can be guilty of just a hoax? You're going to get plenty of volunteers and crisis actors or whatever if you're just pulling off a well-paying scam; getting even people of low integrity to participate in murdering innocent people is a hell of a lot harder, and harder to cover up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, if there were real killings and bombings, they would not let the evidence go to waste. We would see evidence -- gory, bloody, messy evidence. There is none.
           </p>
           <p>
            I totally am with you that TPTB would not hesitate to kill innocent people, I just don't think it has come to that yet. The evidence is in favor of no real deaths or injuries.

            I said disregard #2 because I saw a lot of people disputing the time stamp of the tweet, but apparently there was actually a tweet from some "ISIS" looking Twitter account that did occur before the event and included the hashtag #Manchester or something. They were talking about it on

            lets say it was a falseflag op with real casualties (
            <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/92894366/desperate-parents-hunt-for-children-after-manchester-bombing">
             there are still parents waiting on confirmation from the hospitals if their childeren are among the victims
            </a>
            ) maybe focus on what kind of explosives were used. then it'll be clear that it indeed was a falseflag ; its really hard to get first grade explosives and its closely monitored who/what has access to these explosives. like wtc that were first grade explosives used in such a quantity that its impossible to have been excecuted by "muslim jihadi terrorists".
           </p>
           <p>
            when the "terrorists" use the methane gasses in the sewers of a city you can be sure it was a real attack.

              i wasnt there so i cannot confirm. 
if there really wasnt an explosion , it was a hoax and you are 100% right.
but if there was , its best to focus on what kind of explosive was used.

                it was the only thing i could find in a short time , i thought the flash itself was rather short for a bomb ,
the bang sounded more like a small bomb. maybe in a few days there will be more material available.

                 Yeah I'm sure more media will emerge but so far the lack of imagery and video that actually shows anything is speaking very loudly in favor of this being totally contrived.

             Absolutely, I haven't really looked into the Grande Illuminati stuff myself but I have seen a lot of it out there.

            <p>
             And yeah someone told me that there was a NSFW picture of the aftermath on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">
              /r/The_Donald
             </a>
             so I went and checked it out, and of course it's low-res, shitty, and doesn't show anything definitive except a badly staged "blast scene." And this is taken from a different room through several doors! Par for the course, just release one shitty photo that doesn't reveal anything.

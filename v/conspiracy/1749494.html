            That's ONE reason.  But there are several.  For one, there is virtually no competition.  If your car needs an oil change, you can shop at 20 different spots.  If you need a surgery, you go and get it immediately from whomever your doctor or health insurance decides.  There's no competition at all.  That's another HUGE reason.  Then tack on the fact that doctors are often shittier than mechanics, frequently kill people on accident, and have to pay billions in insurance for that eventuality....  Yeah, there's a million reasons our health care system is completely fucked.  This is just one of many.

            As long as we're not forced to buy something we don't want, I'm satisfied. So-called healthcare just means conventional health care, which is a huge joke. It causes worse health. Only proper nutrition etc improves health.

            I liked RINOcare because it set them up for market outrage and created viable alternatives (HSAs, insurance unions.) It would've killed the insurance industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it wasn't passable, so I say we should just block grant to the States, tell them to pick up the difference if they wanna help foreigners and the intentionally, content unemployed.

            The natural end of a healthcare system is rendering itself obsolete as the population in which it operates becomes healthy and no longer needs anything but treatment for acute injuries and illness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Traditional business models don't work for this. It's like being a company that sells rape whistles: if your business is too successful, then you'll be
            <em>
             out
            </em>
            of business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Industries like this are in my opinion a prime candidate for being provided by a government - though that is by no means a panacea, and it still has to be done well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The currency the healthcare system values needs to not be money (as ongoing treatment for condition is so much easier to monetize and profit off of than curing or outright eradicating it), but the satisfaction/goodwill of the people… government and religious institutions are the only ones I know of that are able to operate indefinitely off of that resource. And I'd prefer a secular healthcare solution, personally.

            We could try a true free market where hospitals are held to the same standard as other businesses where contracts that can make a real profit can't be enforced if signed under duress but profit can be made through additional care after making the consumer informed about prices.
           </p>

            Currently hospitals break all the common law.

            Why will no one talk about this?  Because every other reform discussed will make somebody money.  Nobody makes money off of hospitals conforming to standard business ethics.

            I paid 1,200 recently for what turned out to be a non-life threatening situation.  I cut my thumb really deep camping and was worried I could bleed out (not crazy when you're on a mountain alone).  The second we removed the bandaging it seems I had dressed it pretty well and was good to go.  But it didn't stop there.  I said I should probably go.  They told me I needed to stay.  I had no clue the costs so I didn't argue too hard.  Ended up handing them a blank check.

            I say you can charge at cost to save a life and then make money on additional care after informing costs.  In my case that would have been tetnus shot, antibiotics, reopening and cleaning.  There is plenty of opportunities for them to make money.  They just can't take someone fearing for their life, ignore their wishes, and then write whatever number they want on a bill with no breakdown.  That is theft and extortion.

            Insurance is the problem.  There is enough to be improved with business practices that together with government guaranteed loans everyone should be able to pay out of pocket.  Insurance is what makes this expensive.  Insurance really is paying interest on a loan before you've received the principle.  By changing it to loans you are just delaying paying interest for the time that you aren't hurt.  This also means you have more interest in your health because if you are very careful you can spend
            <em>
             zero
            </em>
            on healthcare.  Everyone likes spending zero on healthcare so people will take care of themselves to their maximum ability.

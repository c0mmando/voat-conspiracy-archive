            You respect Alex Jones???

            He's literally a sell out.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is controlled and paid off! He is controlled opposition. There is NO WAY he would be on the air, for as long as he's been, saying the things he says, if they were all true, and they were all some sort of 'leak' from a government source!

            He’s a man who usually speaks his mind. That’s why he’s bad at hiding the fact that he thinks she’s pretty. In lust though? I don’t think he’s that stupid after his first divorce. Plus any man or woman acts differently around people they find attractive. Doesn’t mean they’re going to cheat on their spouses.

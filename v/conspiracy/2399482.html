            I did a small amount of research on this. Nothing really stands out for me. I like to keep an open mind to the tools they use against us, but I'd be interested in knowing what interface is used to RNM. For example, wifi needs to have an appropriate receiver for the output to be understood. What many are talking about here is our bodies becoming a host. how is the 'signal' transmitted into out brains and how does it 'take over'?

            What does the voice sound like?
           </p>

            Can you suggest any videos to watch that are not only informative , but also provide solid evidence?

             For me it started off as a very intense dream with a demonic entity torturing me with the most complex music no human can ever dream of. This is what set up the belief that I was going through a religious transformation or something. After that I started to see things. And things would react when I would place my eyes on them. I would be driving down the street, and every other street light/traffic light would flicker. And then when I would focus my eyes on a person, or a vehicle they would like spaz out. A person would twitch for a second when I looked at them, and cars would either swerve or brake. Even police. And random people would scream at me in traffic. I thought I was gaining some type of super-power, and if I could master it I could use it for doing good. But then it got to the point where I would look at someone and they would react with disgust. One day at work, whenever I would look at coworkers they would cry. So I got freaked out and walked out mid-shift. After this, my phone and 2 laptops were completely taken over. The UI would randomly change, core features went missing, and mainstream websites were altered, like I was being fed an alternate internet. Not even dban would fix the problems.
            </p>
            <p>
             At night, when I would see a lights, they were in the form of skulls. And I would get cars that would follow me around with license plates that read "Demon" and "Death". I was gang stalked, but I couldn't talk about it because people thought I was crazy. And I don't blame them. But I did get some satisfaction when even people I was with, noticed cars following me.  I didn't hear voices directly talking to me, but I heard sounds, with visuals. The only direct talking I experienced was through the FM radio on my car. They made me feel like I was on a gameshow or something. I would drive, and they would encourage me to drive crazy, run red lights, etc. They gave me instructions and I followed the instructions, which led me all over the place. A parking garage, hospital.  They made it seem like there was a big prize at the end. But there wasn't.  I'll never forget, a couple months when this started, I had gotten used to it, to the point where I would ignore my eyes and ears because I could not trust them. I think this might have made whoever was messing with me bored, because then they tried to convince me it was aliens. They were literally beaming generic alien sounds from like a 50s movie into my head. And I would just smile because it was so pathetic and fake.

             The only reason I know of the term "Remote Neural Monitoring" is because I ran into a guy who claims to have worked for the CIA. It was a random guy at first, and we started talking. I mentioned to him what I was going through, and for the first time someone knew what I was going through. He explained it to me, and gave me some things to look up. Shortly after that, it all stopped and I went back to normal. There's a lot of details I am missing, and could probably write a book on my experience. The only solid evidence that I've been able to find is the 2nd link to wikipedia talking about Project Tempest, which admits that anything with an electric current can be spied on. Our bodies have electric currents and there is technology out that uses brainwaves to interact with computers. Is it really far-fetched to believe the goverment doesn't have the technology that can read and inject waves into the brain? I'll look for more reading material when I am free.

                I rely on intuition a lot in life. Based on what you wrote, my thoughts went to the Legion and Jezebel.
I believe that you are being honest with your story and that is how it happened to you. From an outside perspective it comes across like demonic or familiar possession.
I don't want to get all biblical on you, but I think if you had faith, NOT religion, faith, than whatever is doing this to you and people like you would not be effected.
               </p>

                If you put our Father in your corner, give him power, your vessel will have no room for anyone else. Just a thought. If you're interested in my words, I am happy to share what I know with you.

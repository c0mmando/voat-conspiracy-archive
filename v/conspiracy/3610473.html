            If matter cannot be created nor destroyed, how would the Big Bang Theory have created all the matter in the universe? The story seems to be there was nothing, then came an explosion that created everything. If nothing existed, what created the explosion? If the Big Bang Theory is correct one would think explosions create matter, but matter can't be created nor destroyed? This is an endless Circle.

             Thus viewing a distant galaxy with a redshift of eight whereas between here and there is another galaxy with a RS of four indicating it was speeding toward the more distant place, while from the more distant galaxy our galaxy the Milky Way would similarly have a RS of eight.
            </p>
            <p>
             So too would the intervening galaxy viewed from the far galaxy have a RS of four, indicating it was speeding toward us at a pretty good clip, it can not be speeding in both directions at once can it now .. when confronted with that the Big Bangers start on about balloons and expanding space.

            <p>
             Assume most spiral galaxies that look the same are roughly the same size, as distance reduces the linear dimension constantly so does redshift increase in proportion, thus a spiral galaxy that subtends an angle of one degree will be twice as distant as another two degrees wide,
            </p>
            <p>
             Similarly a galaxy half of one degree wide will be twice as far as the first and four times further than the other .. blue shift is observable in the discs of rotating galaxies thus the light from a distant galaxy will exhibit mean redshift in proportion to its linear distance.
            </p>
            <p>
             Expanding the image further as rotation brings parts toward us they will be slightly blue shifted back toward the norm, similarly as rotation takes objects away their light will be shifted so slightly even further toward the red part of the spectrum.

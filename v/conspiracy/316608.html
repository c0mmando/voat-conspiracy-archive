            Not to be an ass, but aren't there better subverses for this stuff? 
I think most people are here for political news which go against the Western narrative of history.
I'm tolerant towards religious people, even creationists, but you're flooding this subverse with your religous agenda.

            Just because a creationist has some conspiracy beliefs does not mean you should spam his garbage about refuting science with fundamentalist Christianity, many of his videos include his call to become saved bullshit. This guy is a for-profit religious zealot who uses his niche market to try and make as much money as possible, there is a reason he is a convicted felon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit- Also, creationism is not a scientific theory or explanation, it is religious doctrine and only the fringes of the religious community give it a second glance, most religions are not frightened that their entire worldview crumbles because the universe is more than 6k years old. This guy is a Fundamentalist Evangelical Baptist, need I say more.

             That is one of many disinfo/shit-posting accounts around here.  Look through the comments if you need more conformation.

             If you disagree, I'd advise you to downvote and more along. You simply can't argue with certain people.

            I always felt like hardcore creationism arises from a combinaton of dogmatism and a sort of existential fear. The dogmatism aspect involves, for many people who have never been exposed to ideas outside of Christian fundamentalism, a
            <em>
             legitimate fear
            </em>
            of going to hell for not accepting these teachings. These people are Biblical literalists, and to question the literal historical accuracy is to question God, which is to condemn oneself to a literal fiery hell. To most of us who grew up in normal, non-fundamentalist Christian traditions, or who were never really exposed to any Christian religious teachings at all, this sounds absurd. It
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            absurd, but fear is powerful, and these people indoctrinate their children into this way of thinking very early on. I say this as someone who has no problem with normal Christianity. I live in the Deep South, and I grew up here. These creationist types are a totally different animal than your standard American Catholic, Episcopalian, or Protestant church member.
           </p>
           <p>
            On a deeper level, I think there is a psychological appeal in the unrelenting
            <em>
             certainty
            </em>
            of these particular brands of literalistic, fundamentalist Christianity. The Bible is approached not as a divinely inspired human document, full of symbolism and open to interpretation and analysis, but as a
            <em>
             literal historical truth
            </em>
            -- the
            <em>
             only
            </em>
            literal historical truth. This removes uncertainty about the most basic human questions, the questions that inform not only our spiritual pursuits, but our scientific inqury as well.
            <strong>
             Who are we? Where did we come from? How did we get here? What is the nature of the world around us?
            </strong>
            Since the dawn of behavioral and cognitive modernity,
            <em>
             Homo sapiens
            </em>
            has been inclined to ask these questions, both speculating about them, and engaging in observations that can further inform us. We want to know who and what we are. For many individuals, especially in modern societies where people often feel rather groundless and alienated, these uncertainties can frequently cause existential distress when first confronted. After all, it ties into ego, in the form of needing a transcendent sense of importance for ourselves (on both an individual and collective level). Biblical literalism removes the uncertainty that has long been accepted and acknowledged in other world spiritual and philosophical traditions. There are no questions. There is no doubt. There is one nice, convenient volume that contains literally all the answers. I think that on a deeper psychological level, this is comforting-- especially to those who grew up immersed in Christian fundamentalist culture.
           </p>
           <p>
            To question the idea that the Bible is a literal historical document, quite literally written by God himself, is upsetting to many of these people. It shakes their idea of who they are, what they are, and why they're here. It introduces uncertainty, which is unsettling on a level that many individuals don't even fully understand. It
            <em>
             frightens
            </em>
            them that things may not be so simple as "God made the world within a humanly understandable time frame, in literal days, using clay sculpting and other methods that humans can intuitively understand." However, naturally, reality is far more complex. People have long speculated in many cultures the existence of vast expanses of space, other worlds, and inconceivable lengths of time, ideas which have recently been largely confirmed by our empirical observations. The advent of the universe and of life isn't a simple thing, readily understandable to a human mind. It's vast and complex, and has involved thousands of top intellects and centuries of inquiry to get to our current understanding. No one person can fathom all of it at once-- even expert evolutionary biologists and paleontologists, for example, may only have a general surface knowledge of disciplines like physical cosmology or quantum mechanics. It's so complicated, it takes multiple people and many human lifetimes to understand. I think that complexity and uncertainty is frightening to people who are so entrenched in the simplicity, comfort, and black-and-white thinking of Biblical fundamentalism.

            This is preposterous.   We have solid video showing an American gunship helicopter basically murdering a group of journalists carrying television gear in Iraq. Megyn Kelly comes on Fox News to tell us it's a video showing "our proud heroes overseas taking out some militants".    That was an absolute lie, and over murder to boot.  Nothing happened to Megyn Kelly, or Fox News in general.  Nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yet,  Brian Williams says "We are being shot at" non-chalantly and he is talked about for 2 weeks on blogs and goes on a 6-month suspension?    This is asinine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anybody remember Private Jessica Lynch?  The media all told us that she got into a firefight with insurgents in Iraq , wherein she "fought them to the last bullet", and then they told us that she was "captured and being tortured in an enemy compound".      Later we find out she was knocked unconscious when her truck crashed, and the insurgents delivered her to a hospital.    That was lies on top of lies. Nobody was sent on a
            <strong>
             6 month suspension
            </strong>
            for feeding that concocted bullshit to the American populace.

            In 6 months, the majority of the population will have forgotten all about it, and Bryan Williams can go on with his career.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's another confounding thing to me though.  After 6 months people will forget about it all and get used to Lester Holt or whatever.  But then what happens after 6 months is up?  All that the triumphant return of Brian Williams is going to do is remind people of why he was gone in the first place.  It makes no sense.  It feels like they can't fire him for some reason, but they also need him to be gagged for a while.  I'm sure his suspension is probably pursuant to him not being allowed to make any appearances or talk about it.  Similar to what happened to Conan O'Brien not being allowed on television for 6 months after taking whatever deal NBC gave
            <em>
             him
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            So 6 months pass and he's back all of a sudden.  And all of a sudden I'll remember where he's been.  Maybe it's really a non-firing firing.  So strange...

            I'm not taking sides but I can see where you're coming from. It felt a bit like a hit piece on him.

            There's no consistency with what is a 'career-ending' moment. Richard Quest was caught doing weird shit in Central Park with meth in his pocket - on a bad day that would be the end, but he's still on the air. I'm not saying whether or not he should go, just pointing out there there are double standards all over the place.

            Most of the time, people in showbiz get fired when it's convenient, not when something bad happens.

            They just repealed the domestic propaganda bans. We are now being propagandized to by the government. That is the change.

            What gets me is who really gives a shit?  I don't hear
            <em>
             anybody
            </em>
            talking about this in my day-to-day life.  I just hear it in the media.  As I said before, I just assume the news is stretching the truth to fit a narrative.  For it to be laid out so plainly doesn't really make me bat an eye all that much.  I wouldn't even be thinking about it if it wasn't being brought up all the time.  CNN especially seems to have a hard-on about it.  Is this just some kind of phoney facade of outrage they are throwing up so they can be like, "See?  We are serious about journalism!  We will not tolerate untruths!"

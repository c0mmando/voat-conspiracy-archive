<p>First of there was the case of the flags on his jacket from the picture that was his facebook profile picture, one from apartheid-era South Africa, the other from white-ruled Rhodesia — that have been adopted as emblems by modern-day white supremacists. There was many claiming that these had possibly been photoshopped. I did however find someone had posted this picture which appears to be an undoctored picture of that photo before shopping of the flags was done. </p>

<p>To me it looks just as suspect really, the quality is not that great and probably wouldn\'t stand up to any photo shop forensics. The patch itself seems like an odd placement, unless it was placed there to cover a rip or tear of course. Reverse image search pulled up nothing so I\'m dubious about it to say the least. </p>
<p>Then on to his facebook account, I never got there before it was shut down so missed inspecting it fully, but as far as most reports go it was just mere months old and only had one post and three pictures. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/LM2Tt">https://archive.is/LM2Tt</a>   - shout out to whoever linked me this archived version as it give me some leads to go on.  The first person to comment after the incident as seen here was gospel singer Marcus Stanley, and he himself was a victim of a shooting, shot eight times as part of a gang initiation. </p>
<p>I saw people claiming different amount of friends on his facebook friends list and also questioning why Gary Meek, who the media portrayed as his friend wasn\'t on there. Well I suspected that many people would have unfriended him as soon as they became aware of the situation to distance themselves from it, and I was right, I managed to find some early pictures of his friend list and it did indeed include Gary Meek.</p>

<p>At a glance it\'s a mixed bag, 50/50 white and black,  many guys and girls around his age. I thought I would investigate further and check some profiles out, I haven\'t had time to go through them all but I checked about a third and they all have been on fb for years and look like legitimate accounts of average teenagers with the usual posts and normal interaction and nothing looks suspect. A few of them haven\'t been online and their last posts where a while ago, and a couple had private profiles,  but many of them make regular updates. some of the ones who have updated have not mentioned anything about Dylann, perhaps unaware of events or maybe just not wanting to make it public that they had a gunman in their friends list. Others who have updated it seems have been harassed by media and others about the incident and they all say the same, they don\'t know who Dylann was and are not even sure when they friended him on fb. </p>

<p>You get the idea, feel free to check others out but please don\'t harass anyone, it appears that their inboxes are being swamped by truthseekers and media, and they don\'t even know Dylann or have any connection with him other than excepting his facebook friend request.</p>
<p>I also had a look at the on the census which came up with nothing    <a href="https://imgur.com/QgJjc0q">https://imgur.com/QgJjc0q</a>
He may have changed his name over time or the government may have put a block on it so I\'m not sure it means much.</p>
<p>But i did come across this guy, Dylanns\' name sake barring the one &quot;n&quot; in his name. When news first broke out it seems a lot of people got in touch with him believing him to be the shooter. As this picture shows he has had trouble being mistaken for him in the past and in fact often recieved things intended for Dylann storm roof such as yearbooks or friend requests, so I guess that proves he has existed as Dylann storm roof for a while. </p>

<p>Other factors that I found interesting around the event are....  Jeb Bush was due to visit charleston but cancelled because of this event. Hilary Clinton was already there on a presidential campaign fundraiser, not only that but the pastor of  Rev. Clementa Pinckney attended this fundraiser on wednesday. Now Hilary Clinton has always been very anti gun and spoke out about gun control many times, you can imagine that wherever Hilary goes there will be a small media circus following behind. So her being right in the centre of this is Hilary who has been campaigning for more gun control and an instant mass of media with her to report on it and push her agenda further.</p>
<p>Another fact that is known is that  Rev. Clementa Pinckney of the church had recently backed a bill to make it mandatory for all police to wear cameras. Coincident or not I think these facts are worth bearing in mind. </p>
<p>Anyone have any views on this or any other research they have been doing?</p>',

           But i did come across this guy, Dylanns' name sake barring the one "n" in his name.

As this picture shows he has had trouble being mistaken for him in the past and in fact often recieved things intended for Dylann storm roof such as yearbooks or friend requests, so I guess that proves he has existed as Dylann storm roof for a while.

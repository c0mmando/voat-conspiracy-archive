            There was no single killshot. JFK took three rounds, one from the front that hit near the right temple, one from the back hitting the same side of the head, and a small round from Jackie firing a deringer thru a hole in her handbag that hit JFK just below the throat.The latter was intentionally misconstrued as an exit wound, but was actually an entrance wound.

             The grate in question is more at the level of the overpass ahead, and it provides a clear line of sight to jfks right temple. I also think that the “pink cloud” shot came from the grate.

              One of those JFK shows back in the 90's had a guy angle out the shots.  Roof of Dal-Tex building, 6th floor SBD, and the last one didn't make sense because it appeared to come UP.  The guy walked the street, and about shit himself when he saw the grate being right where he predicted using video and maths.

               I saw a video where the guy opened the cover and stood in the depression - perfect concealed shooting spot with the grate facing the plaza. I think that the bullet was fired from the grate, through the corner of the windshield (a hole that was originally “missed”) and hit jfk in the head for the “pink spray” moment.

               As much as it seems like the driver was involved, it seems like the senator and his wife were directly in the line of fire. He may well have pulled a gun and was going to use it but his opportunity was blocked. When he saw someone else had made the head shot, he went back to driving.

             Derived from original research done in Dallas in 1968 when the memories of witnesses were still fresh, Mr. Newcomb's book made the case for the limousine driver shooting JFK so well he sent copies to the 1975 Congress and Senate, believing he would be guilty of obstruction of justice" if he did not do so.

            Don't be single dimensional on the Bill Cooper link, here the assassination occurred in the early hrs of Saturday morning Nov. 23, on the following Monday morning school scuttlebutt was adamant his driver had shot John Kennedy, this information was overwhelmed in the MSM that beat the "LHO did it" drum from the start .. the story never died and turned up intermittently in a Japanese publication that concentrated on offbeat material regarding aliens and things, other places as well.

             The whole James Files situ is a red herring designed to distract notwithstanding the wickedness of Files, while authors Wim Dankbaar and [the late] Jim Marrs were deliberately muddying the JFK waters with this type of material.

            <p>
             The JFK debate is riddled with false flag websites and sham forums, Mr Dankbaar is a polite and co operative man, despite he has banned me from participating in his on line forum at jfkmurdersolved.com!

             The same cannot be said of Marrs whose deportment at Waco Texas in 1993 during the siege of Mount Carmel that resulted in the deaths of as many as eighty eight Branch Davidians, was reprehensible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vernon Howell aka David Koresh had pleaded with the Press Corps for a fair hearing in that the ATF had entered shooting, and that he fired back in defense of his household .. Marrs led the response which was mockery and chanting!

               You never know. Have you ever read about the Lee Harvey vs. Harvey Oswald (2 men) theory? This has more to do with how he went to Russia and back and then Mexico City beforehand. Also Lee Harvey could have been there to do it and missed, we won’t know without more information. This situation has stunk for fifty years, and we didn’t get anything from the “declassification”

             There is a great write up about the film being developed by Kodak. The film speeds, having to leave the premises after developing but before the final print. So much room for manipulation. The developer also specifically mentions all cutting room floor materials were gathered afterward.

            Possible but unlikely. The sewer grate guy is just as plausible. Unless more info is released, we will never know

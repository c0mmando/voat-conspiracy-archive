            They stayed alive by not actually being against the jews.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Reminder that you will never, ever, ever, ever, ever answer any of my questions.
           </h1>
           <p>
            The jew cries out in pain as he strikes you.
            <em>
             You feeling salty, you little fucking leftist bitch? This is Voat. Your lies don’t get to go unquestioned here.
            </em>
            <strong>
             Here are some more questions you’re too afraid to answer:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you substantiate your claims?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the credibility of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why can’t you answer any questions that someone asks about the MERE CONTENTS of his statements?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did nothing he said in the first half of November come true? Much less any of his longer-term predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why would he ALERT HIS FUCKING ENEMIES about a mass arrest on a public venue?
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why isn’t he using this public venue (again, alerting all of his enemies and exposing him and his coup attempt) to DIRECT PATRIOTS AT A LOCAL LEVEL? Because he isn’t.
            </li>
            <li>
             If Q is real, why did these alerts begin MONTHS before the actual events? Do you have any idea how quickly these traitors can mobilize and flee a country? Still waiting for that martial law, by the way.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Do you fucking faggots put ANY thought into your spam these days? Why isn’t Q posting standardized, organized talking points that we, as individuals all around the country, would use in our home cities? When the fucking power goes out. When the fucking news comes on with, “We’re just getting word that Donald Trump has directed members of the armed forces to arrest every member of congress, much of the agencies of the executive branch, several justices, and may even be performing arrests of news officials. This is a coup, ladies and gentlemen…” NORMALFAGS ARE GOING TO BE FUCKING TERRIFIED, CONFUSED, AND WILL RALLY AROUND SOMEONE THEY KNOW AND TRUST IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITES (between rioting, that is). So if Q is real–and is a patriot–why isn’t he disseminating things for us to hold onto that can be spoken through a loudspeaker in a town square, when surrounded by friends, family, and fellow citizens?
           </p>
           <p>
            Because he’s not real. Because his earliest claims were proven false. Because only a fucking dipshit would give MONTHS notice to kikes of their “imminent” (Still waiting! Listen and believe!) arrests. And because only a fucking PAID SHILL would think we would fall for the “free lunch” scenario where the ✡government✡ (funny how Q, the civic nationalist, hasn’t directly mentioned anything about jewish control, huh?) arrests itself and we, the people, don’t have to lift a FUCKING FINGER, because the ZOG military will SURELY protect us!
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             TAKE HEED. WHEN SUPPORTERS OF AN IDEOLOGY ARE TOO FUCKING AFRAID TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE IDEOLOGY EVEN SAYS, THAT’S CODE FOR “THIS IS A FAKE.”
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now please, run along and kill yourself, you pathetic milquetoast piece of moral relativist shit.
            <strong>
             I call on anyone else who normally posts on CBTS or any of the other Q-related… what do I want to say, discussions… to enter into a dialogue.
            </strong>
            I’ve been following Q since the first threads in late October. I would like my questions answered, because none of the fucking faggots shilling for Q anywhere else on any other board is man enough to answer them.

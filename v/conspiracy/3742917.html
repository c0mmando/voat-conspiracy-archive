<p>SUBJECT: This paper together with its appendixes (missing from all FOIA documents) and inclosures [sic] is intend to present the first or a series of contributions toward a more complete knowledge of certain special factors bearing on threats to COMSEC. In particular this study seeks to increase our knowledge of one fact known as PSI which is presently little understood and could considerably enhence [sic] a human being\'s capability to guess the correct order of randonized [sic] key settings or the relationships between our operations code (KAC\'s) groups and their meanings, the underlying plaintext of an encrypted message or to influence an individual\'s use of keying material to hostile analyst\'s advantage.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII: Defense Against ESP</p>
<p>As noted in Chapter VI, the test scenes declines when the two subjects began to dislike each other and become bored with tests. For many years researchers have complained about the &quot;decline factor&quot; which as in most tests is caused by the tedium of doing the same thing over and over again in a boring manner. While mild doses of drugs and alcohol seem to enhance the ESP factor in some perceivers heavy drugs or alcohol has a destructive effect on ESP. Research has consistently indicated that a distracted calm on dreamy state is good for reception of ESP material but it is poor for transmission. A state of confusion in the subject especially when engendered in a skeptical environment has always been observed to hinder the PSI factor. Where negative ionization of a mild nature seems to enhance perception, positive ionized atmosphere inhibits and makes a person nervous and depressed. While intense concentration is good for transmitting telepathically, it is a poor condition for reception. From time immemorial it has been reported that enclosing oneself deep within the one-who-is• is a very strong protection against such attacks of perception.</p>
<p>The above defenses are principally passive but there are reports from primitive people and more sophisticated psychics that active measures can be used to confuse the mind of another. The British report some curious cases of malignant ESP where natives in the Pacific Islands were targeted for death by the tribe and didn\'t know it at the time, but they still died with no apparent cause of death discovered.</p>
<hr />
<p>NOTE TO THE READERS: These are 10 years before CIA\'s Stargate, Army\'s GrillFlame, or DIA\'s CENTER LANE. These program names are just a few among around 10 different programs that involved all military intelligence groups including FBI, and some Police Departments.</p>
<p>The two document reference #s are specifically Appended with NSA, like many of the NSA documents within the CIA\'s FOIA database.</p>
<p>Please consider the known and verifiable history of the CIA/NSA and the facts that they are all taught occult knowledge, but may not be actual initiates (makes for good snitches as they rat out their own populace like cowards and daddy\'s boys). Also consider what we know to be false-flags, war theatre, weather modification (atmospheric manipulation, radio towers, and 5G) among the many new-fangled consumer gadgets being thrust onto everyone.</p>
<p>Let us not forget the pharmacological aspects of the CIA, and government in general, span around 150 years in total. With or without the NAV/CIA/NSA/ARMY researching ESP and psychic phenomena, all of this knowledge is contained with all mystery school and sacred religious texts, which all came before these military arms proclaimed the discovery of something that lives within everyone. The rise of autism, mental disorders, super-soldiers, and whatever pop-culture pre-programming you can think of.</p>
<p>Lastly; Lolita Express - Discovered by remote viewers\' and handed to the FBI 17 years before Jeffery Epstein was even a name. Trade Tower and OKC also referenced by the remote viewers sessions. We should ask ourselves what came first, the prophecy; the art of making prophecies to affect change among the populace (rome\'s tribunes for all sects), or the blocking of it all-together and institutionalizing artificial dependency on technology and government for all forms of knowledge and learning?</p>
<p>Many of you do great work against what you believe to be satan. Many of you do great work against what you believe to be mass-child-trafficking (where do they actually go?). Many of you do great research into alien conspiracies and government cover-ups. If you have a problem believing these documents (even if you do not agree with the last paragraph\'s associations), then perhaps you should drop out know.</p>
<p>And if you really think the CIA is the only blackop organization, then your head is too far up your own ass. If you plan on reading these documents and the many associated with it, you may as well look into their research in radiation, 2G (millimeter waves), and the terrible side effects associated with microwave radiation. As a primer for those going to dig, it\'s all radiation. Microwave, Radio, EMF, UHF, 5G. They\'re just different names of the spectrum as they\'re deployed into other aspects of our lives. The mass roll-out of radio was more than just comms for the military. Whatever group(s) actually founded the CIA/NSA/NAVY (whatever), they know what they were doing. Learn about Church architecture and Masonic buildings (the real ones).</p>
<p>Indeed it is about the children. It has always been about the children. As we all know, they have to tell us their plans so that we make a decision going forward. Even the so-called &quot;good guys.&quot; The lies are deep and this is about more than your specific field of interest, or your specific fear of interest.</p>
<p>QRV/PIZZAGATE/VOAT in totality have spent years down-voting this all. Too close to their psyops goals and way above most of their people\'s experience level.</p>
<p>Please, as always, DO THE RESEARCH YOURSELVES.</p>',

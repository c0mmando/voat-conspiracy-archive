            Maybe we need to shake things up with a little military grade anthrax in the mail. Remember the folks duct taping themselves into their houses? Also, remember the plane that “lost its engine” the following week? It smashed into Queens or Bronx if I remember correctly. Never happened before or after.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              While the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 immediately raised fears of a new terrorist attack, federal investigators said last night there was no evidence to suggest that the disaster was anything but an accident.
             </p>
             <p>
              After recovering the cockpit voice recorder and listening to it, NTSB investigators said they were leaning toward the theory that the plane had suffered a massive mechanical failure before it crashed at 9:17 a.m.
             </p>
             <p>
              "All information we have currently is that this is an accident," said Blakey. "All communications from the cockpit were normal up until the last few seconds before the crash. It points to no criminal activity."
             </p>
             <p>
              But investigators last night were still looking for the flight data recorder. And they were interviewing witnesses who said they saw an engine separate - and others who insisted they heard an explosion beforehand.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meanwhile, investigators grappled for answers to other vexing questions: Why did the vertical stabilizer separate from the plane and fall into Jamaica Bay? Why did one of the wings fall off? What caused the engine to separate from the aircraft? Why didn't the pilot issue a Mayday alert?
             </p>
             <p>
              Some witnesses said they heard a pop and saw the plane plummet from the sky. They said the plane disintegrated before the fuselage hit the ground and burst into flames. A wing and the tail section fell into Jamaica Bay, while other pieces of the plane scattered through the leafy, waterfront neighborhood of single-family homes.

              It's impossible to swear that nothing went wrong, since you can never know if something went wrong you don't know about.

              But I'd expect that if there's "so much evidence of fraud- at least since of it would be presented to the courts, no?

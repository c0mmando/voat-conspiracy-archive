<p>The best genetic match for a mate is a second cousin based on health of offspring and overall fecundity. Cities have too much genetic diversity and too many distantly related people so fertility naturally drops as population density increases. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>There\'s a ton of research that has been tainted because of the IQ crowd. But there is a ton of forbidden research on aptitudes. The research was done using mafiosos and other criminals as a data set. Scientists wanted to know why different races gravitated towards different types of crime. </p>

<p>There exist wonderful data sets to show the decrease in criminality and mental illness as lead products were banned and shows how it persist in communities too poor to remove toxic building materials.

            The genetic diversity of Africa is really important for long term health of the population only because genepool outside of Africa is relatively shallow but probably as far as physical adaptability is concerned Mongoloids have everyone beat. Negroids and Caucasoids are more specialized and neither can thrive in the others  preferred climate.

<p>Often groups of informants are used to silence conspiracy investigators.  Informants may be unpaid criminals given a hard choice, but also include those paid for their services.

This video is aimed at fine upstanding businesspeople who may just need some form of &quot;trouble&quot; to disappear.  All the better if their trouble is with regulations, police forces, or financial in nature as they are then easier to manipulate and turn to the cause.   This goes beyond bribery and PR shill campaigns and uses the powers of &quot;The Network&quot; to actively silence pesky &quot;loud mouth&quot; investigators who uncover closeted skeletons.</p>
<p>After joining the Network the member will be called on from time to time to help stamp out someone else\'s &quot;troublemaker&quot;.  Secret societies have been doing such things forever, but now the practice is commercialized so you don\'t even need a cloak, dagger, or secret handshake to join.  Corporate espionage is a lot darker than some may think.</p>
<p>This vast network was once created by &quot;government&quot; agencies to combat political activists and celebrities under the guise of silencing agents of soviet subversion.  Today it\'s the secret weapon of The Powers That Be or any profitable business with the same vision of a new world order.  Those unfortunate idealists who find themselves in the Network\'s cross-hairs may feel like the <em>Whole World</em> has turned against them, but really it\'s just a cleverly orchestrated Network of globalists from all walks of life.</p>
<p>The controlled opposition term for the Network\'s HUMINT operations was &quot;street theater&quot;, now commonly known as &quot;gangstalking&quot;.  Due to its more corporate motives some now refer to the psychological warfare as &quot;cause stalking&quot;.  The disinformation campaign to muddy the waters surrounding this conspiracy is even aided by its victims themselves.  Not realizing the true nature of the attack, the PSYOP\'s victim will be convinced that even their neighbors are out to get them, and try to tell the world all about it.  Once driven to frenzy the victim\'s own family may be pressured into committing them to a mental hospital, &quot;for their own good&quot;.  Much as the Stasi used to do with their dissidents.</p>
<p>This may all be common knowledge, but it bears repeating.  And I thought the recruitment vid was interesting.  Some conspiracy investigators imagine a terrifyingly powerful collection of evil forces at the highest levels of society without understanding the compartmentalized tendrils reach all the way down to the rancher across town or the small family owned corner store down the street.  Too many wind up having to don the tinfoil shield against <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc-dH3Tl7oo">microwave weapons</a> because they didn\'t realize even hashtag activism against small business corruption can be fatal thanks to The Network.</p>

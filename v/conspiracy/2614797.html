There’s rumor on the dark web about the FBI building in Las Vegas being hard-wired for a 9/11 demoltion style as a bomb narrative. The clock is ticking... Tic-Toc, Tic-Toc, BOOM!
my own personal OPINION-They are ALL THE SAME PEOPLE. Antifa, Spencer, KKK(oh heck YES they are)working for their F.B.I. field commanders that work for the CIA which is ultimately run by the English Royal Family. Why? The English Royal Family is stamped all over every slave empire in history. Spare body parts? The English Royals are so inbred their DNA is tied in knots. They have been using all humanity as a MENU for whatever human flesh they need to keep from going extinct. 
I think Paddock was planning to sell or give weapons to ANTIFA to be used at the NOV. 4 event that FAILED. And there was a Saudi coup the same damn day. Weird. FBI guy in charge is agent Aaron C. Rouse. Here are a few interesting things about him: He was appointed to the Las Vegas division of the FBI by James Comey in July 2016. He was section chief of &quot;clandestine&quot; operations, which by definition is...&quot;an intelligence or military operation carried out in such a way that the operations goes unnoticed by the general population. Aaron Rouse\'s brother Gordon is married to Megan Podesta John Podesta\'s daughter.
Also, James and Heather Murren are both Obama (Deep state) appointees and James Murren is CEO of Mandalay Bay. It makes sense that Steven Paddock\'s home was broken into after the shooting. It gave time for the FBI (and/or CIA) to clean up any connections

Amazing that the Mandalay has over 1600 CC cameras and nothing has been released. Campos getting shot in the hallway and not one frame of footage released? Everyone with a brain cell knows Paddock as a patsy. Foreign PMC responsible. FBI doesn\'t want the public to know they can\'t protect you OR the PMC double-crossed the initiative
Okay, we can all talk about what happened and speculate but bottomline is that THERE IS A COVERUP and (most) of the  American People are just shrugging their shoulders and moving on after young people DIED &amp; were traumatized forever.  It makes me sooo angry!  I think we should BOYCOTT VEGAS!
WTF HAPPENED IN VEGAS!?
Now I\'m not sure how true it is but I seen a video somewhere where 11 Saudi princes was arrested and one confessed that he had snipers in Vegas and was responsible for the shootings as a cover for a assassination attempt on another Prince if I remember right have you hurd anything about this?
There are a few videos that talks about the Saudi owning the top few floors of the hotel, and one of the prices said he had snipers at the time in their suites.﻿
that is Prince Al-Waleed bin Tala, part owner (with Bill Gates) of the floors just above Paddock\'s room. The reported confession has been in print with the suggestion that he is talking after being tortured. If a team was going to attack someone on floors owned by Al-Waleed, a great location for the weapons supply arsenal would be a floor slightly below, at the end of a wing, right by the stairs that go to Al-Waleed\'s floors. This could also work the other way, if Al-Waleed had guys on his floor to be used for an attack (the primary target would be his opposition and not people at the concert), it would still be a good location for the arsenal. Either of these would explain the large number of weapons. That quantity of guns and ammo does not make sense with the lone gunman story, IMHO.
What if the FBI needed a massive influx in heavily armed security personnel.  Quite logical to go to PMC sources.  They may have had intel that made them suspicious that the RT 91 was going to be a target for a retaliatory strike for the closing of the Alpha Bay dark drug market.  This is very normal behavior for a drug cartel that has not been put completely out of business.  They dumped manpower at the situation.  Typical government reaction.  Still seems like a hit.  fire up Tor and make a few inquiries on the dark net forums.  They may contain additional intel.
The first overseas trip of the administration was to Saudi Arabia that was in the middle of a power struggle. The opposition leader visits Vegas and stays in the floors right above Paddock\'s room with his security guards. This is the only place in Vegas that the (former) opposition leader and his associates stay. That important fact has been withheld from the public. If someone was going to have a team attack there, what would be a great place to stage the armory? Does it make more sense for a big cache of expensive weapons to be for one guy or many guys? Is it really that hard to connect the dots? Police scanner tapes show reports of gunfire at many different places. Multiple witnesses back that up. I analyzed the soundtrack of the start of gunfire. The sound waves show an obvious weapon change after the first 5 single shots. The change happened in less than one second indicating a second shooter. The fuel tanks had a bullet penetration. Due to tank construction requirements that would not be possible at a range of 620 yards, with the weapons in Paddock\'s room. There was obviously not 1100 spent shells in Paddock\'s room. As far as I know there has never been a mass murder done by someone with a profile at all similar to Paddocks. The cabbie video soundtrack, and witness accounts, indicate near gunfire and then far gunfire. The webcam history from the Bellagio at the time there was a shooter there vanished. There is obvious lying by the only witness at the scene. The FBI has confiscated all the cell phone video they could, and is withholding that (and virtually all the other evidence). You may say that there is nothing that you would accept as &quot;proof&quot;. That is fine but you are rejecting all the logical conclusions, and buying into the very unlikely ones, IMHO. For too many people, the definition of &quot;proof&quot; is someone with a uniform talking behind a podium. That is not good enough for me when the story smells fishy.﻿
Since five eyewitnesses died under suspicious circumstances after speaking out about multiple gunmen, perhaps that could be the reason why people are either too terrified to come forward, or they speak out anonymously. Just my thoughts. Keeping an open mind as many people try to do. This seems to be an intelligent audience. Appreciate another perspective.﻿
Which country is ultimately funding ISIS mercenaries? It has been said America formed them initially. And we hear Trump and Putin are working towards eradicating them. What is the truth eventually? Are Blackwater aka Academi, brothers in arms with ISIS? Could they band together to overthrow certain small countries, and set up shop, so to speak? Since Erik Prince is a billionaire, isn\'t he now super-powerful? Mr. Trump is chump change compared to some Saudi billionaires, huh? His $10B compared to some there having over $100B...!
I have never seen a list of the people who were killed or injured. Why? Every other incident had a full list published within days. Has anybody on a citizen level tried to compile such a list? Could we use social media to do it?
This is a CIA op this is their style gunning innocent people down from helicopters that’s my conclusion from watching other vids. That’s way when people are reporting shots fired in other casinos they can’t locate any shooter because they are on the helicopter not on the ground
You can hear the helicopters in the air on a lot of the video people shot. There are also a lot of witnesses that made reference to the helicopters in the air. One girl said it seemed almost like the were following them. She said she no matter how far she went she still felt the were right behind her.
A HELICOPTER WAS FLYING CLOSE IN FRONT OF THE MANDALAY HOTEL LEVEL WITH THE 32ND SECOND FLOOR...A VIDEO SHOW A HELICOPTER FIRING AUTO FIRE , NOT A STROBE LIGHT,RIFLE FLESHES WAS ON FOR A GOOD 20 SECOND--THEY STOP TO RE-LOAD AND THE FLESHES STATED OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN... ANOTHER VIDEO SHOW HELICOPTERS PICKING PEOPLE FROM THE ROOF, SNIPERS ???
the explanation for this shooting is beyond simple USA Jewish gov. agency did a favor to some very wealthy muslims to get a chance at shooting american soldiers/civilians (infidels) like fish in a barrel. There was more than one shooter, and enough guns for atleast 3 shooters. The actual shooters definitely got away with it alive and free. and the jew-fbi just used some random white guy to take the fall.
they landed on the roof and did a drop off and picked up mercenaries﻿
So, is it the SAUDI PEOPLE? or is it our own? Fbi /cia/ blackwater hit team???? Who was flying these helicopters ?!?!?</p>',

            So 1 guy with NO military background, no weapons training, No tactical training...broke a 800lb hurricane glass with a sledge hammer, avoided to be seen by ALL hotel cameras, Set up reconnaissance outside his room, THEN managed to ACCURATELY fire down upon people killing 50+ and injuring 500+ with also managing to handle the rate of fire from these rifles (23 to be exact)....yeah i call bullshit 100%﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            When I saw the two glass holes in the side of the building my immediate thought was  WTC 911 where they created the outline of an airplane just like the outline of the cow in the cartoon where the farmer chases his cow out of his house and the cow runs through the wall and leaves the outline of her shape.  It was all psychological.  So too are the windows broken out in the building.  Of course you are going to think  SOME ONE SHOT FROM THERE.  That's why they "created" the broken glass and why everyone naturally thinks that's where the shooter is.  But the real shooters were not there. The room was staged.  Anyone familiar will see all the anomalies in that room scene.  The guns were positioned the wrong way.  They were all positioned with the barrels towards the shooter position. That's not correct. If the shooter wanted to take the next gun he would have to take the time with each gun to turn each gun around and when he was finished with them he would not put them down with the barrels facing him.  It's said he shot 1,100 rounds yet you see only 40 to 50 empty cartridges on the carpet.  The are not in a position that the AR-15 extracts them and tosses them out. The AR-15 throws the empty approx. 12 from the gun and they land in an area about 4ft. by 4ft.  They would never be positioned as you see them in the picture with them all being 180degrees to each other as if someone had them in their hands and tossed or rolled them out onto the carpet..  The AR-15's extractor pulls the casing out of the chamber and flings it back out and it hits the protrusion that's made to direct the empty casing out to the right of the shooter.  When it does this the casing is spun like the blades of a helicopter and they land in all different positions.  So what you see there with the casings all in a row is staged.  And if Paddock did shot himself it had to be in the mouth because there were no other wounds in head.  So the revolver that he shot himself with couldn't land behind him like it is shown in the photos.  The whole scene is phony and if you know anything about guns you could tell that it was all set up and staged. NOT REAL.
And the police have all his guns and they should have at least 50  bullets from the victims and more from all the wounded (500).  So what are the results of the gun forensics.  When know they can tell from which gun a bullet came.  Right there they can prove it was one gunman because the gun forensics should show all the bullets fired into the victims and wounded came from the guns in Paddock's room and no other guns.  That's police work 101.  Where are these test results???  And why hasn't the Press asked about it.  The answer to the lone shooter or many shooters can be determined so easily with the matching up of the bullets in the killed and wounded to the guns in Paddock's room.  No one mentions this aspect of police investigation.  SOMEONE PLEASE ASK THIS SIMPLEST OF QUESTIONS.  What are the results of the gun forensics????  Did the bullets in the killed and wounded come from those guns.  They have the test results and the fact that they don't present them tells us there is a cover up.  The Press should be ashamed and the people should hold them and the police to a higher standard﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            Why on earth would you take that many guns to a hotel room, with so much AMO and not fight it out with the fbi/swat team and just blow your head off, and have gloves on and cameras set up. on the outside..... jeez guys, this is such a bad set up. His brother slippin up with arms dealer, no cctv evidence shown of him leaving and entering the hotel let alone that room, probably because it was with undercover agaents. plus you would not be that rich form just going to loads of Casino's. friggin weird and so sad.﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            MORE THAN one shooter . victims said they was chased by more than one let alone one in hotel , there are more video cam in las vegas than rest world combined , you CAN NOT flip a coin in las vegas without BOTH sides that coin being read by 50-100 dif cams
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think that the bullets taken out of the bodies and victims in hospital will match all the guns on display?
You can tell if the bullets came from the same batch. factory..have the same metal ratios..
But the government is going to cover this up
           </p>
           <p>
            Dude he was FBI undercover. They were doing a gun deal went wrong. They shot him and made it look like he did it. Too many gun for a guy to have to do a job like that. He was going recording the gun deal. FBI not going to tell us the truth.﻿

            Wow this is a set up from the word go, someone who was killing people wouldn’t shoot him self. He would have had a fire fight with the police for sure, and a bump stop fires faster than ALL the videos show. It was a belt feed weapon for sure, and no muzzle flashes from the rifles while shooting is ridiculous. Where’s the video from the lobby showing him carry 15+ bags or cases to his room.... they have hallway cameras too so where are those videos, such a set up.

            No, that man was used, there are other forces at work, while people are busy checking him out the real culprits are having fun at their success. I am an outsider, I don't live in the US but I stay in touch with the news.  What if it was the illuminati, who carried out a mass ritual of bloodshed.  At present these people are unable to carry out their rituals since the change of government. And they figured that ISIS would be blamed if anything.  Devil worship is a real thing I  realized  and payment to the Devil is a must for the followers.  Then it would make sense.  There may be big guys involved, hence the lack of information to the public, perhaps he was given the amount of ammunition/explosives to blow up people with the car, and he declined. Perhaps, he did as he was told, but never fired from the Hotel, or he fired blanks and the real shooters were elsewhere, near the crowd.  In the dark, no one would see clearly who was shooting as the shots were in the distance.  Perhaps, this was meant to be worst, with more dead, maybe he did what he thought was right knowing that he would be killed anyway.  It could be he took money from someone, who made him do what he did.  He was a gambler, and he gambled his life away, because if he stayed alive and talked.  That would be great trouble. America has many enemies, and they must always be aware. Now ISIS loves to tell people they are going to die, before they commit their acts, so I will not rule them out as they now have base in America and they are very good with camouflage. However, Americans kill Americans too, so this is a really tricky situation of finding the culprits.﻿

            These little guns did very little shooting the most fir was by a belt fed machine gun . There were 3 shooters. The advertised for crisis actors in Southern California in August... part of this video...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzO_KMMB7_Q... I think the FBI was a big part of this planned event !!
Could have been a gun sale that went sour....Stephen Paddock's plane was purchased by an Obama planner who was an intelligence contractor like Snowden was.... Paddock had no training to do something like this.....500 pounds of weapons--and the hotel does nothing? wtf! They should have requested to see the luggage contents, at least!
I am having a difficult time buying this whole story... or lack thereof. I don't trust the CIA or FBI.  Other videos I have seen calls into question people on the ground shooting into crowd.  I am not buying this event as it being this guy.  I think he was dead before shooting began
it had to be a political shooting,,why film it unless you have a message to speak,maybe he was a democrat trying to kill republicans?,,it sounds crazy,if no clear motive comes out somethings being covered up,,it was too well planned,,i counted 100 rounds being fired,was a 100 round clip found with him,,those clips in the pic dont look like 100 round clips
The rumor is also that Stephen was an undercover FBI agent on a sting that has gone wrong.  The body camera and camera under the cart may have been for FBI surveillance, not to look out for cops or leaving a message.  The rumor goes that he was selling weapons to ISIS - U.S. and were trying to bust them until ISIS realized they were being setup.  There are bomb making materials in Stephens room and his car, but they were materials, not actual bombs.  All evidence, thus far, points to multiple shooters and weapons sales.  LVPD, FBI, and MSM are lying about what's going on.

            September 26, 2017 WASHINGTON — A man arrested near the White House on Sunday morning is a former Memphis police officer who had an arsenal of weapons in his car and believed the CIA had implanted a chip in his head, according to court documents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Timothy J. Bates, 37, of Collierville, Tenn., appeared in a District of Columbia court Monday morning on charges of illegally carrying a rifle or shotgun.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to court documents, Bates was approached by uniformed members of the Secret Service on Sunday at the corner of 17th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue as he appeared to be publicly urinating. He told the officers he was trying to reach Defense Secretary James Mattis or NSA Director Mike Rogers “for advice on missing paychecks and how to get the dog chip out of my head.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Bates gave officers permission to search his illegally parked car and they discovered nine firearms, including a Bushmaster assault rifle and a loaded AK-47.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to testimony by the arresting officers detailed in the court documents, Bates told the Secret Service officers that he had been offered $28.7 million by the Department of Homeland Security and the state of Tennessee to participate in the CIA’s “MK Ultra” program and that he had a chip planted in his head that was causing him “severe headaches, shaking and convulsions.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Bates told the officers that he had driven from Tennessee to seek advice from Mattis and Rogers on how to remove the chip and recover the promised payment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The court documents state that Bates is a former police officer who was “medically retired” in 2013 and that he was “involuntarily committed for mental health reasons” in February 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was not immediately clear if Bates had his own defense attorney.
           </p>
           <p>
            The charge of illegally carrying a rifle is a felony with a statutory maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000. The court documents state that Bates had been placed under observation for mental illness.
As news of the deadliest mass shooting in US history was breaking in Las Vegas early Monday morning, deputies in Tennessee pulled over a vehicle for speeding and found inside a large arsenal of loaded firearms, including two machine guns.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal, his officers arrested Scott Edmisten, 43, after a traffic stop led to the discovery that Edmisten’s license was suspended for failure to appear in court.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edmisten was initially found to be speeding on Old Jonesborough Highway in Johnson City, doing 55mph in a 30mph zone at around 4am Monday.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the deputy signaled for Edmisten to pull over, the man sped up to 80mph, but finally came to a stop a half-mile down the road, according to a press release from the sheriff's office.
After the driver was taken into custody for allegedly driving on a suspended license, the deputy searched his vehicle and discovered a .357-caliber Magnum; a .45-caliber semi-automatic; one fully automatic .223-caliber AR rifle; a .308-caliber fully automatic AR rifle, more than 900 rounds of ammunition, and survival equipment, including knives, a hatchet and a fire starter.
All of the weapons were loaded, and according to the sheriff, neither of the fully automatic rifles were registered or even had serial numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sheriff Graybeal said Edmisten had modified the two AR rifles himself to make them fully automatic.
           </p>
           <p>
            As he was being processed at the local detention center, Edmisten allegedly made threats toward the arresting officer and other staff members, and lunged toward investigators who were trying to interview him
The 43-year-old suspect was eventually subdued and placed in handcuffs. He was charged with speeding, felony evading, and possession of prohibited weapons.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was later arraigned and ordered held without bond pending a hearing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators are still working on the investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have been called in due to the unregistered machine guns.
           </p>
           <p>
            'Anytime you have several firearms and several hundred rounds of ammunition in a vehicle, that always causes a concern,' said Michael Knight, an ATF spokesman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities still haven't determined why Edmisten was carrying all that firepower, but they 'don't see a connection' to recent mass shootings, Knight said, adding that investigators are tracing where his weapons came from.
           </p>
           <p>
            'Our priority is reducing violent crime on the front end, so that's the other thing we're looking at, along with motive: Were these items going to be used for a criminal act or were they just being transported from one area to another area?'
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking to the station WJHL Monday, Sheriff Graybeal said it took his deputies about two hours to compatible a full inventory of the items recovered from Edmisten's vehicle, making it the largest weapons haul his department has ever seized during a single traffic stop.
Bad timing: Edmisten was arrested just a few hours after a man holed up inside a Las Vegas hotel with two assault rifles opened fire on a country music festival across the street, killing 59 and injuring more than 540
‘I think it was a splendid traffic stop, especially after what happened in Las Vegas,’ the sheriff said. ‘Whether this guy had any intentions of anything or not, I don’t know, but he was ready for something, every clip was loaded, every gun was loaded, everything was loaded that he had with him.’
           </p>
           <p>
            According to his Facebook page, Edmisten has a teenage daughter and a younger son. His page is filled with memes and angry posts railing against Family Court and Child Protective Services.
           </p>
           <p>
            His final status update, posted about 15 minutes before Monday's traffic stop, consisted of a link to a YouTube video featuring Ted Nugent's song Stranglehold.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 43-year-old suspect was arrested just a few hours after 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock, of Nevada, opened fire on concertgoers attending the Route 91 Harvest Festival on the Las Vegas Strip, killing 59 people and injuring more than 527 others.
           </p>
           <p>
            He committed suicide before police arrived at his hotel room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay, across the street from the venue hosting the sold-out country music festival.
           </p>
           <p>
            When a SWAT team entered the gunman's suite, they found two modified assault rifles and 21 other weapons, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition.
Ummm yeah both TN cops are linked and linked to Stephen Paddock and the TN naked waffle house shooter and the one busted in Sep 25 tried to do something to Donald Trump. Fuck the FBI/CIA and the alhpabet soup agencies.

            I may have figured out the missing link.  I believe there was a precision guide military grade rifle used. The scope is similiar to guidance system in  fighter jets. This weapon comes with ipad, abililty to live stream,upload videos, has wi fi. and a weird pain in the ass battery.  I'm reaching out to you all, because I'd like this seriously considered and some feed back.  Thank you for your consideration.  : )   Smart rifle means hunters never miss

            They are manufactured by trackingpoint precision guided rifles, They are 27,000 and up. If the scope, and  the pad, were removed from the scene... There could possibly be some weird placed wires. The ONLY THING THIS SCOPE WON'T DO IS CALCULATE WIND SPEEDS. HERE is another good link on what this weapon does

            This could also be the peice that ties in the battery guy ( the one that killed hishandicapped daughter then himself)  as well.  This is the little ditty I put together in regards to this  High Stake Guns use High Stakes Streaming

            Stephen Paddock's past needs to be looked into if he was FBI arms dealer he has history that can be looked into. Video of transactions. Everything. Dig up everything you can find on him all the way back to April 2015.

            If Stephen Paddock was an arms dealer he was a merchant of death and got people killed. Maybe he was retaliated against. But why shoot up the strip and become a monster? Saw guns were used but from helicopters with shell casing catchers. And there were shooters right above the girl cab driver with saw guns and they were shooting with tarps under their bodies while prone. Look at the Mandalay Bay from above you'll see what i mean. And there was a shooter on the one oh just you'll see it when uou look at the Mandalay Bay from above looking down it'll explain the flashing from the 4th floor window it was a shooter outsiee the infamous 4th floor window with the flashing light.

            Helicopter likely used in Las Vegas shooting. Created a timeline of auto burst gun fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Helicopters not on Radar close to mandalay appear to do the shooting. Helicopters according to radar should not be there for the minutes before the shooting starts and 5 minutes after the shooting ends.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mystery heli (not on radar) shown shooting during the 4th burst of fire.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see the mystery heli between Mandalay and Delano then you see it fire then gun shots. (look at top left video portion of this combined video between the two buildings) Damaging evidence (should be around 10:07 PM for 4th burst) (at 2m16s in the video below)
           </p>

As soon as the sun rose on the day after the shooting; both the Vegas police and the FBI would have been able to tell you for sure if there were multiple shooters or not because of the bullet marks made when hitting the ground. If all the marks were in the same direction, it would indicate either a single shooter or multiple shooters from a single location. If there were any marks (let's call them skidmarks) on the ground going in another direction it would indicate that there was a shooter, (or shooters), in another location. If there were marks on the ground in a third direction; then three different shooting locations; etc., etc..... If there were bullet holes through a fuel tank, or a vendor's cart, or any solid body; the law of reciprocity could be used to reverse engineer what direction the shooter was firing from by something as simple as shining a laser through the two holes to point to the direction, (not the location, but just the direction), that round came from. For bullet holes that did not go all the way through something, another tool called a 'boresighter' (a tool used to sighting in scopes without shooting the rifle), could be used to get the direction the projectile came from; by simply sticking the end of the boresighter into the hole the same way you would stick it into the barrel of the rifle. And the laser on the boresighter would point in the direction that bullet came from. A determination could have been made in less than an hour to answer the question of if there was a single shooter or multiple shooters; and by the next day, (they need darkness to use the lasers), they would be able to tell you the direction(s) where the shooter(s) location(s) were..... At this point in time, with so many holes to choose from, they could use triangulation techniques to point out the shooter(s) exact location(s).﻿
Paddock did not shoot anyone unless you believe in Zombies he had been dead 3 hrs when the photo was taken . The reason why no shots can be seen from his room because this was a withdrawal action with covering fire . The gunfire from the 32flr began at 10:12:40 and after 3 much shorter bursts followed by 2 individual shots ended at 10:13:30 . The shots were spray and pray through the openings ,the windows having been broken 40 seconds beforehand . At this point most of the spectators /witnesses had fled and very little cellphone imagery or more importantly audio exists , but it does exist , you just have to find it . The second most important video fixes the timeline I have just discussed . These are all supported by at least 2 secondary recordings . I doubt if the gunfire from the 32nd floor hit anyone ,it was intended to direct the police to that area to allow shooting to occurr later at other hotels like the Bellagio . The last 2 shots ? One went through Paddocks head to fake the suicide the other grazed or created the 'non critical' wound in Campos leg . Ever wondered why the cabbie never heard the glass breaking and falling to the ground ? Now we are talking roughly 60 sq ft of glass being broken and falling 300+ feet to the ground ! She had her window open and never drove over any broken glass on the road to the entrance . Now you know why , she was long gone before the glass was broken !The closer you get to the beginning of the shooting the more evidence there is of multiple shooters , which is a minimum of 5 .3 of which were permitted to withdraw under spray and pray covering fire .2 stayed in the hotel, and for those of you who forget yes the Phillippines links to this massacre and is involved and needs to be investigated.

            Las Vegas Shooting- Armed suspect running on Tropicana rooftop.
PAYDIRT!
This is just proof of another possible person involved. This is almost an hour after the initial concert shooting. I don't think anyone is trying to say this person was shooting at the concert from this location. There were multiple locations after the police received reports of gunman or hearing shots at several other hotels. This seems to be very strong evidence that this was true.﻿ Yup...the cameraman knew what he was doing. staggering. staggering co-conspiritors and collaboration. Only way to even begin to plan a shooting of this magnitude. staggering. what looks like a rifle sticking up behind his back. 11:15 timeframe, there are cops who have been meeting up and establishing teams. As body cams show, If they aren't meeting up to team up, then they are holding position somewhere, helping victims find medical, or now responding to the very fresh calls that have just began pouring in for about a 35 minute period with reports of gunshots all around the city. The reason they are teaming up,....well we'd be speculating wouldn't we? Anyway, teams of cops are about to start what looks like a manhunt mission. Plenty of video showing this activity. Yet we have this one guy operating all alone like Bruce Willis up on a dark roof top with no flash light going or back up. Jogs west across rooftop and stays at overhang right above valet for just over 1 minute, then goes in a full sprint back the other direction, leaps up a wall and proceeds to disappear. He is either chasing someone or he is being chased by the cameras. Those are our two options. He wasn't in a good location to snipe anyone near the venue or Mandalay. He wasnt responding to the shots fired at Tropicana as that call was just coming in. If there was a reason for a cop to be up there chasing someone, he'd have plenty of help.﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm SO IMPRESSED &amp; excited at how F**KING AWSOME the hardworking &amp; dedicated group of truthers are to have uncovered this IMPORTANT piece of the puzzle You guys ROCK!!! It must feel good to FINALLY be able to show REAL evidence that there is MOST DEFINITELY a cover up going on with this investigation....or that the LVMPD are the most incompetent fools around! If they actually missed this (they didnt!) then they need to turn over their taxpaid salaries to these truthers who are ACTUALLY TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO DID THIS &amp; WHY Your hard endless work is starting to show UNDENIABLE REAL EVIDENCE that your were right not to give up or be complacent to the official narrative... GREAT JOB! Ever wonder why the camera, while filming the crowd, focuses on just north of the kill zone. The beer stand, at the northern end of the Catwalk that divided the crowd, had a lot of action and was focused on intensely. The FBI picture of the cleanup shows this beer shipping container/concession stand being examined intently by agents. Also notice in FBI cleanup, how bloodstains or spraypainted markings on ground being painted with black paint. NOTICE ALL DARK PAINT SPOTS DIRECTLY WEST OF STAGE AND BACKSTAGE WEST. Some action happened backatage, if u recall the video at ARCO gas station sign, the yellow shirt security said ' dude was shooting from backstage". Idj, possibility﻿ Im wonder with you on the selected camera position. The more people you film running, the less people you film getting shot and the longer you can take deciding your actions. I havent ruled out someone shooting from that general area back there. Others have seen what looked like muzzle flash back that way. If they did they mustve split pretty quick after just a few shots, but that splitting quick after just a few shots would make all those people who called in shootings at the hotels would be a little less crazy than say oh.....Lombardo makes them out to be.﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            And remember Hooters. People were pouring into back entrance of it. Someone even reported a shooter got in that entrance after shooting, as there were some ground shooters likely, as you've highlighted. People were on the move by foot, car, chopper I believe. Just points to a wide or at leasr 2-3 conspiracy﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            Collaboration on behalf of Tropicana and Mandalay Bay cameraman and rooftop person(s)?? Does anyone believe some co-conspiritors/ accomplices, were streaming on social media and, or ,had dedicated radio channels that were helping bad actors get away in the hour after shooting? Think about it, real time updates about traffic, road blocks, non populated areas, all being given and shared to co-conspirators.... WHY DOES LVMPD NOTTTT WANT SCANNER CHATTER PUBLIC ANYMORE?? They put the painful pieces together. Scanner audio was used against their police officers that night. Public streaming, as invasive as it is in society, had to have also been used for this plot that went off, almost without a hitch There is evidence there that can be perceived as people who had foreknowledge. From the people warning and taunting others about an attack that was thought to be happening that night at the venue, all the way down to the yee yee yee yelled before rapid fire. Then we get into these reported shootings around town an hour after everything has stopped at the venue. Now, how many 911 calls came in reporting shots fired here or there? A group of medics call in claiming to be within range of gunfire? We see one guy for sure on a rooftop and something was going on the fire station at the airport requiring police presence? Scanner chatter accurate. Man on roof of Tropicana valet roof. There were also reports of suspects on Luxor valet roof I believe. A chopper is called to area, and chatter about what side of the Sphinx, is in question, can be heard. This is around same time of this Valet roof figure, 11pm, I believe﻿ I wonder if the cops that said there were no shot at Tropicana were telling the truth lol Maybe they are corrupt and part of the shooting lol. So.... everyone knows this was an assassination attempt on the saudi prince right? Stephen Paddock was a gun salesman working for an alphabet agency. Note he didnt load many magazines cause he was just showing guns not using them. So once the gunman killed Stephen Paddock they had large pauses in the shooting to reload magazines. Look up the tropicana video of the prince being escorted by his armed security. Things arent as we have been told. This runner spent 1 minute 17 seconds at that ledge he ran to, then absolutely hauled butt back the other way. Drop the weapon, blend in with crowd, adios! Sure does know his way around a Tropicana roof top.﻿
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I just heard and saw. 11:15pm-11:37pm this 1 guy, with the rifle, who may or may not have actually wounded anyone or killed anyone. Just kept the police dept busy for 22min. At least. I'd say Diversion. Paid someone to just run up over there, fire a clip or 2 and dip set. I imagine tho, that if that's the case, there'll be some evidence. Shells at least.
           </p>
           <p>
            So much for the theory that 'Paddock' was a lone crazed gunman.
           </p>
           <p>
            TheGunit272 said this. "I am a Surveillance Investigator that works here in Vegas. I watch and record video everyday for a living. Please tell me the time stamp on the frame you can see a rifle/gun. I see someone running across. Let me say I believe 100% that there is a cover-up and we are not being told the full story. I worked that night for another casino and remember hearing multiple shooters at multiple places. I wish I could see the weapon you claim is in this video. Sorry I don't.﻿" I wonder if this ties in with the armed crew walking through the Tropicana casino with guns drawn escorting someone...? Great video but I would bet there are more videos out there that the FBI knows they have and put the fear of God unto them to delete it or the FBI confiscated there videos. The FBI has there own videos that will never be seen, because they were in on the Shooting and I still say the ones in the helicopter had a Machine Gun that was belt fed shooting the people because it’s distinct noise an AR does not sound like this There's a video of the whole incident of the Tropicana and all the ambulance and police car showing up there. And then like 5 to 10 minutes later you see other ones going to the concert.﻿
There is an extended recording (
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-CoYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-CoYouTube
            </a>
            ) of the police scanner during the Oct 1st Las Vegas shooting that provides evidence of multiple shooters. In particular I would like to call your attention to:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Police report of shots fired at the Bellagio (15:00-15:11
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=15m0sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=15m0sYouTube
            </a>
            ), 2) which is then denied (18:07-18:13
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=18m7sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=18m7sYouTube
            </a>
            ), 3) followed by a report of a man with a rifle entering the employee entrance of the Bellagio (27:58-28:16
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=27m58sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=27m58sYouTube
            </a>
            ) 4) followed later by the sound of automatic gunfire on the scanner itself (45:02-45:20
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=45m2sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=45m2sYouTube
            </a>
            ), 5) followed shortly after by more description which says the most recent caller reported it at 11:55pm and says suspects are inside with them and so they're whispering so as to not be heard (45:42-46:14
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=45m42sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=45m42sYouTube
            </a>
            ), 6) followed by an exasperated-sounding dispatcher now saying there was no gunfire "per security" which she knows is not true (46:41-46:48
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=46m41sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=46m41sYouTube
            </a>
            ), 7) followed by what sounds like a police call for an additional strike team at the Bellagio (51:03-51:07
            <a href="https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=51m3sYouTube">
             https://youtu.be/P43wY1jK-Co?t=51m3sYouTube
            </a>
            ).
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that this is well after the police scanner has confirmed Paddock is dead. This police scanner activity lines up with other eyewitness testimony (
            <a href="https://youtu.be/-m7X63stwf8YouTube">
             https://youtu.be/-m7X63stwf8YouTube
            </a>
            ) from the Bellagio where the witnesses heard the gunfire at the front of the building themselves, which is seemingly what triggered the lockdown of the Bellagio.

            I wish you would bring to light that alot of people don't know like all the symbolism involved. The names with all the people. I mean give me a break the security guards name is JESUS ANGEL CAMPOS . BASISICALY JESUS ANGEL CAMP... TOO Many in America is sheep and can't see. I could go on and on about the symbolism it's obvious to me to people who is versed and know of certain things to look for. There is thing after thing. The last interview the sheriff did that was like 25 minutes and didn't take questions he said a statement that caught my attention where he said there was FULLUMINOUS amounts of information. That was a word for people in the know. Kinda like the ulliminatti. I am convinced it was an operation to try and start a coup  by the left you notice before a day went by they all talking about gun control. Also look in the Oathkeepers which is big in vegas they recruit police fire and military. Right before shooting Obama and Bill Gates had a meeting with the Gatekeepers. They laid out their idea of what the US and world in their view would look like in future regardless who is president. I honestly kinda think Oathkeepers and Gatekeepers are involved together.  Also Bill Gates has toes with the prince who got arrested and owned the fourseasons hotel part of Mandalay Bay. If you watch old videos of him thru the years you can tell he has total contempt for United States.  He is the prince who showed up in New York and gave Juliani a 10 million dollar check for victims and then had derogatory  statements about IS and Israel foreign policies just few days after attacks while buildings still smoldering . It pissed Juliani off so much he gave. Check back to him and told him he didn't want his money. So I am sure alot more was said that the public wasn't told for him to give back 10 million dollars. He is basically a billionaire who has felt he can do anything and I would bet he had large part in 9/11 being all hijackers was Saudis. Donald Trump has knew that the wrong people was went after. I honestly think Osama Bin Laden was a patsy. I kinda feel like Paddock is a patsy. I kinda think that is one reason why all those princes was rounded up with TALWAWEED BEONG ONE OF them a man who 4 years ago was worth 20 billion dollars. That is something very major that was not much said about it but Trump did tweet that the King knew what he was doing and had things under control. Imagine if the public was to find out those princes was the ones behind 9/11  which has alot of symbolism in it as well just like Las Vegas incident letting certain people know who is behind each event. The sheeple or people who don't study don't have a clue and go man that is just horrible. What a crazy person. It's alot bigger than people know . I wish the truth would come out and I honestly think the Democrat Party and Soros and those princes had alot to do with it. If you think when Democrats lost power last time few months after they lost power we had 9/11  They lost power when Trump was elected but while in power they always put people in positions of Goverment that they are loyal to their cause. Then few months almost close to same number of months another symbolic attack. Not to mention it happened on major Jewish holiday and when a major Arab holiday started next day. The Kabbir. If you look back in history of major attacks they corilate with dates that have meanings or ties to Holidays tied to Jewish or Arab holidays. More research needs to be done and exposed. It no coincidence and it's a larger community than people have a clue. The US is infested with them bit the major enemy is overseas. It goes all the way back to and war. Nazi Germany. They had SS Muslim divisions  of Nazis who was allied with Hitler who was fighting in North Africa. When Germany fell the Muslim divisions disbanded but kept fight gong until  today. The guy who started Hezballah was Yadir Arrafat and his uncle was the guy who was allied with Hitler and commanded the SS Muslim divisions. From Yassir Arrafat and Hezabalah you have got so many extremist Muslim groups with the same goal. People of today seems like they don't understand the comncection. For some reason people have an idea Nazis means white men. They have so many people around world confused and  Muslims like Iran  know it and want the world to be confused. Until people start to understand the problem nd who we are fighting we are going to lose this war because people better start to realize we in a major war and they using our free market system to fight it. They founding major corporations to fund certain operations around world. Alot of major corporations founded in Nazi Germany is still operating around the world and in the US. Just because people think the war ended for alot of people I think they don't think it ever ended they just changed their strategies and they have every intention of making America a police state like Germany was and they are doing a good job at it. They have basically used insurance companies to pass  crazy ads laws to make people to have buy car insurance and health insurance and raise money and lobby lawmakers to pass certain laws. People better start to wake up.﻿

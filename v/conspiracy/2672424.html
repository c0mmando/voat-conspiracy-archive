<a href="https://imgoat.com/uploads/2a0e188f50/135636.png">come on now</a></p>
<p>just saying to the real voaters that there is a narrative being pushed to keep people divided.  stop fighting the left and realize while they are faggots, they are American faggots and we need to be fighting together against these Zionist pricks and not keep the division between us.  This is the king of little things these bitches do to keep the people divided.  literally open your eyes to the little things these losers do to try and sway the public.  
</p>
<p>I mean come on, the faggot uses SovietFerrari as the username which is great if they weren\'t promoting more division between the america\'s fine people.  This ass clown and those like him are easy to spot once you see it.  Literally you just need to open your eyes and not instantly react to what you immediately see or read.  it\'s easy for meme\'s and slogan\'s like this to take fast effect because it\'s catchy however when the left and the right finally figure out we are all getting fucked by faggots like SovietFerrari and this propaganda machine the sooner it will end.</p>
<p>Literally start being aware of how they promote this trash like they did with gangsta rap, most very likely everything related to Q, anything a politician or the msm media spews and faggot accounts like this promoting you to hate your american brotheren, black, white, brown, we are american and these zionist fucks are trying to keep you peasants fighting among yourselves rather than uniting against them.  It\'s time you got WOKE</p>

            Episode 2: If you watch this show, because of your own morbid curiosity, pray beforehand.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Deep State imagery is off the charts.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in episode two, they've stopped calling it the "Book of the Dark Lord" and started calling it "The Book of the Beast."
           </p>
           <p>
            So the High Priest of the "Church of the Night" who is satan's representative on earth uses a walking stick with a white marble rabbit as the head of the cane.
           </p>
           <p>
            He tells Sabrina that satan is not evil, he is about "free will." He tells Sabrina witches who devote their lives to satan are exempt from hell, only mortals go there. And good and evil are what the "false god" teaches.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck this show leaves me with a sick, heavy feeling.

            Kid, I don't know what you're looking to get out of this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Truly, why have you leached onto me with your inane opinions?
           </p>
           <p>
            Only explanation is that you enjoy forcing yourself on strangers to get negative attention... which is what you're doing now, pure trolling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope you're happy with what you've become; a troll.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm done feeding you.  Enjoy the last word troll.

            Of course they are. This is a free site in which anyone can register with little to no effort, completely anonymously - thus there is no cost to the backers other than a little bit of time. It's also well known by the backers that this is where a number of disgruntled redditors fled. Shills would be deployed here, in part to keep it from ever becoming a major rival to Reddit which can be controlled very easily now.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, the term you're looking for with 'second hand shills' is 'useful idiots'. These are basically regular everyday people not in the pay of anyone who have bought into the message that the shills and their paymasters push and are willing to go out and aggressively defend it from anyone they think is 'wrong'. These are usually young men between the ages of 16-25 (though sometimes they are older) because this demographic is usually swollen with bravado and thinks they have something to prove.

            Having worked as a Political PR guy on campaigns and for legislative pushes I can tell you that most of the folks who normally politically shill aren't here. The only group that is here are the Sanders folks who are a grassroots political shilling group but that's another point altogether.

             I turned on Morning Joe for a minute this morning just to see what the Zionist MSM was saying about the Iranian nuclear deal this morning..I accidentally kept it on too long and had to watch them give a loving push for Jeb Bush as a human being candidate. It was essentially a campaign commercial.(sentence added in edit) I turned the channel after I threw up in my mouth a little bit..It is SO obvious how the 2016 "election" is going to go, it is definitely the GOP's "turn" to put their neocon administration in with another Bush frontman for the people the next 8 years.

             not wrong, and the term can become a crutch, but unfortunately, shills do exist, and we should be aware of them, and when it becomes clear that someone really is a shill, it is appropriate to shun and ignore since they are not following the basic terms of engagement that honest people expect from a conversation.

              Please, explain these things to me, because right now I feel the term is a crutch as you have so well pointed out.  A crutch that people fall upon when their intellect cannot hold up their end of the discussion.

               There's no meaningful way a regular user can prove this, at least when we're talking about reddit or voat. The closest thing we can get is assuming. In the same way I assume the sun will rise tomorrow, I can assume someone is a shill. I can't prove it, but all my experiences point me in that direction and I can be 100% certain. I can also be wrong at the same time.

            No, shills may also provide services for money-equivalent or intangible benefits. Corrupt SJW powermods belong to the latter group, for instance. They provide services for the illusion of control in their otherwise useless and worthless lives.

             Though I understand how power can be a form of payment as well, but the key element for a shill is to "pretend to be an outsider" while actually being "paid" to participate.  A moderator is clearly assigned for all to see, so there is little deception going on in terms of the uneven relationship.

            <p>
             The word "shill" has been used by the conspiracy community to falsely accuse anyone they don't want to have any reasonable discussion with.

             That's my problem with the term, it's supposed to be an insult, but really is just a thought-ending cliche.

              A moderator pretending to impartially carry out janitorial duties while secretly pushing some agenda (SJW ideology, or TPP censorship, or something else) in exchange for the illusion of control would certainly qualify for the classic definition of shilling.

               By the very nature that they are moderators their relationship with the corporation is not impartial.

               This isn't "classic shilling" by any sense of the term; though I can see how it bleeds into it when moderators are "bought with power" by certain interests.  I'd like to see specifically how this was done, evidence of it.

             Someone who's opinions you disagree with but refuse to actually discuss what they are saying.  So, instead, you call them a "shill" and pretend that they are a paid government agent who's opinions you don't actually have to take seriously.

             Undercover marketers, PR people, or astroturfers. ("Astroturfing" is "fake grass roots," basically.)
            </p>
            <p>
             These people pose as normal users, so that they can attempt to inject certain ideas, opinions, and viewpoints into the discussion. This could involve, for example, posting something positive about a product. It could also include seeding certain viewpoints in political discussions, or trying to dispel unpleasant opinions about a corporation.

             The thing with Reddit and Voat is that they're not good places for direct advertising. They're designed for users to aggregate interesting content in an unbiased way,
             <em>
              not
             </em>
             for content marketers to promote products. However, Reddit (and to some extent, Voat) provides information that helps marketers to further laser-focus their audience targeting. For example, if you're advertising a brick-and-mortar video game store in Ontario, you could filter and display your ads to users whose subreddit subscriptions indicate that they both live in Ontario, and are interested in video gaming. This analytics potential does make Reddit (and to a less extent at this point, Voat) appealing for advertisers, but there isn't a lot of room on there for blatant ads. So many of us suspect that marketers (as well as possibly political lobbyists) may be posing as users to very subtly promote brands or even ideologies.

              such an in-depth response. the only thing i would add is that i regard the idea that there are shills amongst us as more than a suspicion. rather, i think there is pretty strong evidence for it, for both marketers and political operatives. this evidence is of two sorts: first, from the side of the shill-employer (ie we have official reports of agencies both private and public spending significant money on this kind of thing and hiring people to do this), and second, local evidence from the behavior of certain users.

               This is the final post I will be devoting to you, so if you are genuinely
               <em>
                not
               </em>
               a shill, please note (and I promise this is really easy to understand):
              </p>
              <p>
               If you act like a dingus, it does not matter for a moment
               <em>
                why
               </em>
               you are acting like a dingus. You are using ad hominem in the place of reason,
               <strong>
                which is a problem.
               </strong>
               If you stop doing that, we will have no grounds upon which to accuse you of such a silly passtime as being a sock puppet (after all, who possibly live with themselves, lying to strangers for a living).
              </p>
              <p>
               So.. yes or no answer here: Do ya feel me? Y'know, the general point here that Im trying to make? Yo comprendo? I sure hope so.

<hr />
<p>In this video James Corbett briefly reviews a video that has recently been gaining attention online purporting to show a missile hitting the Pentagon on 9/11, and through a bit of searching with the right terms and a critical eye, finds evidence that the video is fake. He then (at 3:38 in the video) offers a general advisory statement on identifying disinformation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, how do you spot disinformation?</p>
<p>If an incredible, amazing, never-before-seen footage of something you can\'t-hardly-believe-is-on-video surfaces, supposedly out of nowhere, recently released - then disappeared, and there is no source, there\'s no link, there\'s no information, there\'s <em>absolutely nothing to go by</em>, it is <strong>almost certainly</strong> disinformation, and should be treated as such until it is absolutely ironclad <em>proven</em> to you - <em>proven</em> beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is real. Because otherwise we are going to mix up debunked disinformation garbage with actual real valid 9/11 research - and that is the easiest way as the&quot;authorities&quot; have  done for generations to debunk or to get rid of problematic truth movements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for reference or for those who don\'t know what disinformation is, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">wikipedia entry on disinformation</a> does a fair job of defining it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disinformation is intentionally false or inaccurate information that is spread deliberately. It is an act of deception and false statements to convince someone of untruth. Disinformation should not be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation">misinformation</a>, information that is unintentionally false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also relevant is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda">Black Propaganda</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black propaganda is false information and material that purports to be from a source on one side of a conflict, but is actually from the opposing side. It is typically used to vilify, embarrass or misrepresent the enemy. Black propaganda contrasts with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_propaganda">grey propaganda</a>, the source of which is not identified, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_propaganda">white propaganda</a>, in which the real source is declared and usually more accurate information is given, albeit slanted, distorted and omissive. Black propaganda is covert in nature in that its aims, identity, significance, and sources are hidden.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the video (at 8:33) Corbett offers another cautionary bit of advice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don\'t trust me, don\'t trust anyone else that comes to you with undocumented, unverifiable information. Search it out for yourself, and make <em>sure</em> that something is true before you go around promoting it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have your doubts about Corbett\'s analysis of this specific video ostensibly depicting a missile hitting the Pentagon, I urge you to review the show notes on the above link and decide for yourself if his assessment is accurate. James always provides relevant notes and links on his videos, and it\'s always nice to see them there as the source for any claims he makes.</p>',

            Corbett is a real life hero.  This one guy is basically the world's best source for English language geopolitical discourse and high quality journalistic format information on legitimately important topics and all his content is well researched, cited, and clearly and honestly presented.

             I agree entirely. Everything I've seen of his has been wonderful (well ok, except some of his play-acting skills are a little bit embarrassing, but the message is what is important there xD ). I've only really begin to view his stuff en mass in the past couple of months, and I'm amazed at how little publicity he gets on

             . I guess with a sea of content it's understandable that it would drown out the really lucid stuff like Corbett's videos. I hope that we can guard against that somehow here.

              I think that by the nature of sites in this format any area for anti-status-quo information will pretty quickly be overrun with shills, disinformation, misinformation, stupid mainstream people who don't actually research or believe in conspiracies, stupid conspiracists with no discernment, and other cancerous elements.  This is the history of many forums on these kinds of subjects, from those focused on more mundane political conspiracies, or even just radical political ideologies, to those focused on far out topics like alien and spiritual conspiracies, they all pretty quickly succumb to sabotage and decay.  It's too bad but these kinds of places just don't last. All you can do is try to put out good content, point out disinfo, and not get too upset over the inevitable corruption.
             </p>
             <p>
              For various crazy-people-reasons I believe we are rapidly moving into momentous times and those who presently refuse to see what's happening in the world around them, or worse, work on the side of the dark, will soon have no choice but to acknowledge the truth and resolve to fight for what is right or face truly dire consequences.  It's important to try to figure out for yourself what is happening, how you should prepare yourself, and to try to tell people you care about what you think they will be able to absorb without completely rejecting everything you're saying.  But as far as fighting against stupid mainstream idiots and shills on forums, I think that's a waste of time at this point (and an intentionally laid, and highly effective, trap designed to waste the time and upset the emotional state of people who are waking up).

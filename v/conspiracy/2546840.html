<p>The Making of a &quot;Peril&quot;
The Islamic threat argument is becoming increasingly popular with some segments of the American foreign policy
establishment. They are encouraged by foreign governments who, for reasons of self-interest, want to see Washington
embroiled in the coming West vs. Islam confrontation. The result is the construction of the new peril, a process that
does not reflect any grand conspiracy but that nevertheless has its own logic, rules and timetables.
The creation of a peril usually starts with mysterious &quot;sources&quot; and unnamed officials who leak information, float trial
balloons, and warn about the coming threat. Those sources reflect debates and discussions taking place within
government. Their information is then augmented by colorful intelligence reports that finger exotic and conspiratorial
terrorists and military advisers. Journalists then search for the named and other villains. The media end up finding
corroboration from foreign sources who form an informal coalition with the sources in the U.S. government and help
the press uncover further information substantiating the threat coming from the new bad guys.
In addition, think tanks studies and op-ed pieces add momentum to the official spin. Their publication is followed by
congressional hearings, policy conferences, and public press briefings. A governmental policy debate ensues, producing
studies, working papers, and eventually doctrines and policies that become part of the media\'s spin. The new villain is
now ready to be integrated into the popular culture to help to mobilize public support for a new crusade. In the case of
the Green Peril, that process has been under way for several months.[13]
A series of leaks, signals, and trial balloons is already beginning to shape U.S. agenda and policy. Congress is about to
conduct several hearings on the global threat of Islamic fundamentalism.[14] The Bush administration has been trying
to devise policies and establish new alliances to counter Iranian influence: building up Islamic but secular and proWestern
Turkey as a countervailing force in Central Asia, expanding U.S. commitments to Saudi Arabia, warning
Sudan that it faces grave consequences as a result of its policies, and even shoring up a socialist military dictatorship in
Algeria.</p>

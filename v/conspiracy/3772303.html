            The Wachowski brother stole the script and ideas from a white, Christian screenwriter who the studios screwed out of any money, despite the fact that he still has a copyrighted, motorized paper copy of his script from the early 90â€™s.
           </p>
           <p>
            The brothers are typical Jewish thieves. Proof of that is that all their other movies sucked.

            They are indeed possesed by evil spirits thats why Jesus called them synagogue of satan. I ve meet a lot of jews all over the planet since they travel so much and i didnt see one good deed in at least one of these kikes, they are brainwashed satan worshippers at its best

           <p>
            I have been wondering if this is explained in Genesis.  Genesis 1:26-27 explains that we were created by the Elohim, in their image and likeness.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Genesis 2, this Lord God character (YHWH/Jehovah/Satan) comes along and modifies the humans created in Genesis 1.  This modified human is what we call Adam.  Adam was no longer in the image and likeness of the Elohim like we are.
           </p>
           <p>
            What did the Lord God do?
           </p>
           <p>
            YHWH is not a Creator God, and this makes him very, very jealous.  All YHWH can do it take what was created by the Elohim and modify it.  Given what I know about these sick and disgusting satantic pedophiles, YHWH took good and made it evil and he took evil and made it good.  This is the Jews and these other people we are fighting against.  This is the Masons, especially at the upper levels.  They are all the army of Satan.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if we originally had unity of consciousness, but then YHWH split our brains into left and right hemispheres.  It seems like this somehow made us susceptible to brainwashing and the control matrix that YHWH created.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some reason, we are more in touch with our divine nature given to us by the Elohim.  We reject the evil of YHWH, but these other people are mesmerized by it.

              They don't have high iq. They have 25 points lower than average. They are just devious and steal any good ideas they find.

              They truly are morons with no ability to create anything new. Creativity is not tested by iq tests for the benefit of psychopaths. Otherwise they would be exposed as retarded.

               This makes sense. Usually they use somebody else stolen ideas for their books or movies. Some authors sue them, other don't even bother.

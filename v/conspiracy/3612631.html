              I feel like it's worse than last year. In area hectare or at least proximity to people. Or maybe it's just fires are closer to me and some family this year.

              Not seen any evidence of DEW though. Can't watch videos right now but yeah, that other comment is shit it's like he copied text without bothering to add the links which is mostly what it is.

            How does it feel being that retarded that the mildly plausible conspiracy theories are still not conspiracy enough for you so.you invent literally the dumbest fucking shit you possibly could?
           </p>
           <p>
            The funniest part about it is that you either dont know, or do know but are just ignoring the fact that the two reasons california burns as hard as australia is because the weather is pretty much the same *and some fucking moron in the 50s planted fucktons of australian eucalyptus plants while forgetting or ignoring the fact they burn like fuck.

            At least while youre shit talking about this stuff the dumb motherfuckers are spending so much time trying to invent reasons why this shit is normal that no one has bothered complaining about how racist australia day is.

             We are dealing with Zionist aggression here, instead of pandering to the Ziomedia version of events and going into "witch hunt" mode if the arresting officers had researched the subject they would have found the "fires" which have been occurring world wide are an artifact of Weather Warfare, HAARP, and the Agenda 21 push to establish "World Government" with its capital in Tel Aviv, Israel.

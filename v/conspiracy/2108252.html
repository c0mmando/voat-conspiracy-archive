            If you refuse to participate in the stock market lottery, and choose not to work 60hrs a week, any savings you have is chipped away at by inflation. The only way to fight this is to spend money on physical assets that create value. A hydraulic preess can be a handy thing, but then again so can a chainsaw. It's all about knowin how to use the stuff, and how your contribution adds to your community. Also, grow a victory garden, you win!

            Inflation kills the free market, which is exactly what the banksters want to happen. If we had a true free market, healthcare, housing and education wouldn't be so inflated. There is also the fact that government regulations cause supply to not meet demand and the market to be out of equilibrium because of that. Then they tell us more taxation will solve the problems that they created.

             Federal income tax goes solely to the owners of the federal reserve, it pays for nothing.  Federal reserve is a private corporation which loans what is nothing more than monopoly money to banks at interest.  This debt is impossible to pay off and a total falsehood used to make people believe they owe someone something.  The federal reserve is a misunderstood form of slavery which makes the federal reserve owners unimaginably wealthy and powerful turning them into the unseen oligarchy/dictators of the USA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pair this yearly sapping of all wealth, their power of selection on loans, taxes on inheritance and inflation and now you can see why the bottom 80% of people in the USA have merely 16% of total wealth in the USA, the wealth distribution is massively skewed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Beyond this, much of the dollars printed, the 'petro dollar' (something like 1/3rd of dollars made) exists outside of the USA, when those dollars come home the value of the dollar with plummet.

             They are trying to get us to follow the 1910s-1940s nazi versus commie script.

             The idea is to say lets abolish the federal reserve, solve these issues, reclaim the stolen wealth acquired through usury, and then with some of the money we will send blacks to africa to their own nation with restitution and aid. Their goal will be to make africa a better place and then we can help africa ditch their version of federal reserve.
            </p>
            <p>
             Similar story with mexicans, aid, armed, educated and then sent to dismantle their private bank and to make mexico a better place.

             It's a tragedy of the commons scenario.  Individuals that take out loans can get things that allow them to get ahead.  But if everyone does it, it becomes necessary and society becomes owned by the bankers.

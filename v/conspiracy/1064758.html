            I should probably mention that I only watched that video as far as the slow motion of the text. I checks 4-5 videos before I found one that was edited to my liking.
           </p>
           <p>
            A few days ago I replied to a user who was questioning a couple tweets that snowden posted in support of 'social justice.' My reply actually applies to what you're thinking here, so I'll cut/paste it for you:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hear me out here... he might just be a patriot who believes in social justice. Those two tweets (from late 2015) are quite factual though. Traditional divide and conquer tactics call for targeting smaller groups first. As for "social justice is common sense," he's not necessarily wrong. "Justice" is a pretty subjective concept, which means that everyone has their own idea of what social justice is, and therefor everyone should support the concept. That's what makes "social justice" such an effective double speak phrase. Before that is was "affirmative action," which by the dictionary, is both completely vague and totally redundant. This is social engineering, designed by people who know how to manipulate human psychology and language. I think snowden was trying to counter the divide and conquer tactic required to dominate a populous.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another completely valid possibility: He might be deep-cover, meant to orchestrate a limited hangout. He brings the people a gift of information (that the NSA knew would leak anyway), he teaches the people how to protect themselves from technology (something most IT professionals could do), and then assumes his place as speaker for a generation of angry and scared people. Once he gains that position as spokesperson, he is free to splash a bit of an agenda in alongside the truth. It's not as if the CIA has never had a double agent, or performed a limited hangout.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or, perhaps he's a troll. Russia is a cold place, and laughter warms the soul.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I haven't made up my mind on this one, but some of snowden's mannerisms just put me off somehow. Here's a few things I noticed in
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxKLpArDrC8">
             this discussion
            </a>
            :
           </p>
           <p>
            He blinks A TON. This could be understandable anxiety about being an enemy of state, it could be his (yet unsubstantiated) epilepsy diagnosis, or simply the body language of a person who knows they are lying.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also has an interesting habit of positioning the frame of his glasses dead-center across his field of view (mainly his left eye). This is a public speaking trick I learned back in college, which helps with simulating eye contact when you're nervous. But again, who knows why he's nervous. There's like a dozen valid possible reasons for that anxiety.

            I love the idea of steganography! (minor typo in your spelling btw, spellcheck doesn't like that word)
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe I'm just paranoid, but anytime I see something like that video I am reminded of sensory overload techniques used to subject people to subliminal messaging. I suppose under the definition of steganography,
            <a href="https://youtu.be/WDsI-zk6gfE?t=3m27s">
             the 1960's united states TV sign-off
            </a>
            with the subliminal messaging, would be included.  The early SM attempts like that sign-off were proven to be only marginally effective, but with massive sensory overload, the same techniques supposedly work better.  This is why I don't watch TV.

            I tried to witch this, but it's just such a clusterfuck of cheap audio/video effects I can't pay any attention... I'm sure there's some good info here, but I just can't stand to look long enough to find it.

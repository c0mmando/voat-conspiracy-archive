            I remember when I finished school thinking (this was a while ago), "What I can do anything I want now?" I always thought that was crazy. They way everything is so controlled at school then you are suddenly on your own.

            I've got a feeling that her child was expelled, and to save him the embarrassment of being expelled,(and to save herself the embarrassment of having her child expelled) she pulled him out of the school to homeschool him.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             sending one’s child to the average American public school is like putting him through a game of Mouse Trap every day and just hoping he doesn’t come back physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually damaged in some way.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The school's job is to give them skills like adding, subtracting, grammar, etc. Along with being able to take criticism and follow rules, etc. The school's job is to prepare the students for the world, not protect them from it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             would randomly get up in class and start doing other stuff because he got done with things early.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So he repeatedly refused to follow the rules. Just because he works faster or slower than the average, doesn't mean that the school should change the rules to accommodate him simply because he's bored.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             a kid whose personal hobby was to bully my son stole my son’s water bottle and took off with it on the playground.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Sounds like she doesn't know the difference between being bullied and being teased. A bully would take the bottle, punch her kid, and tell them if they did anything about it they'd kick the kids ass. If someone grabs it and runs with the intent of making the kid chase them, that's playing and/or teasing.
           </p>
           <blockquote>

           <p>
            Her kid was doing something that could have resulted in serious injury. Her kid deserved to be stopped and had the severity of their actions explained to them. And the severity needed to be made clear enough that it would be guaranteed it would never happen again.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             in my son’s eyes, he was just trying to get his water bottle back from a bully and he’s seven, so it isn’t exactly the vicious, premeditated violent crime this teacher made it out to be
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Her son didn't understand how bad the consequences of his actions could have been. He didn't just need his actions stopped, he need to have explained to him how bad they were. Otherwise this could happen again. Her son thought he was only stopping them from getting away. The teacher taught that brilliant kid that wrestling on a ladder is bad. Because he couldn't figure that out on his own. I hope in homeschool she remembers to teach lessons like wrestling on a ladder is bad.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the teacher already deciding my kid was a “problem child”.

           <p>
            Her child thinks it's ok to break rules simply because they're bored. Yes her child is in fact a "problem child".
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the teacher who, when he thought any of the kids were “acting out,” would get right down and put his face maybe two inches from theirs to discuss punishment in an eerily quiet way that scared the crap out of my kid and made him feel all kinds of uncomfortable
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The teacher, when seeing kids "acting out" would put a stop to it and would make sure it didn't happen again. That's what a good teacher is supposed to do.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             teacher yanked my son away from the slide. Hard.

           <p>
            The teacher saw a kid trying to pull another kid off of a ladder! They put a stop to it as quickly as possible by pulling that kid as quickly as possible!
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             My son responded by biting
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            HER KID IS 7 YEARS OLD AND SHE HASN'T TAUGHT THEM TO NOT BITE PEOPLE? And she would bite someone too if she was pulled too hard away from seriously injuring someone? This is the type of parent she is. Her kid literally bit a teacher and she says that her kid did nothing wrong! Re-read the story while keeping that in your mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her kid, who doesn't think the rules should apply to them, and has been rightfully described as a problem child, is caught trying to pull another kid off a ladder, then bites a teacher. Is she now homeschooling her child because SHE chose to? Or because he was expelled? Or because it's just a matter of time before he's expelled?

            Sounds a lot like what happened to Aaron Swartz. He pretty much invented wikipedia, before that pornographer stole Arron's concept. He started reddit, and was pretty much forced out to pay for his legal battles against the federal government. And then he was found dead, hanged in his apartment, a few days before receiving the verdict to his case. He turned down a plea bargain that would have cost him only 6 months in federal prison. Those are not the actions of a guilty man.

            Its more than just marginalization and intellectual theft. They will take everything you have, and still kill you if you oppose the direction this nation is headed. 'Evil empire' is too kind a phrase for this dystopian BS.

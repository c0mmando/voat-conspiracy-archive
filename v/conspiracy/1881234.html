            You know something is going down when they allow a msm outlet to openly say "muslims are a problem and need to be removed"
           </p>
           <p>
            It's like them saying "please let this slide, we will give you concessions if you let this slide"
           </p>
           <p>
            So now i am waiting, because one of two things will happen:
           </p>
           <p>
            A: people will talk about the false flag, because the (((lizard people))) will start allowing people to talk about islam being dangerous.
           </p>
           <p>
            B: the virtue signaling cucks will latch on to the seth rich scandal, because they would rather talk about how evil white people are, rather than talk about islamic terrorists.

            Most of this may be true, but I don't see how it relates to KDC negotiating his sentence.

            A true patriot has no use for the security apparatus. Hoover was cross-dressing octaroon who started a blackmail club to keep people from outing his faggoty black ass. A few weeks ago, I posted what James Jesus Angleton had to say about the CIA: he controlled it so long as he exempted a small circle from polygraphs. The better elements? The elements of "pig fucker" are still pigs and fuckers. Their rightful place? Let's give the pig-fuckers their constitutionally ordained leadership role: not existing.

             American
            </em>
            train. Meaning white ethnonationalist. Meaning Jeffersonian government with Salamancan economics. Meaning isolationist.

           <p>
            I stand on the Christian train. Meaning the destruction of the demonic state of Israel and the extermination of world jewry. Meaning the restoration of Christian policies to American government as the Founders intended. Meaning–eventually–the mending of the Great Schism, the deposing and hanging of the Pope and his heretical band of papist scum, and the reunification of Christendom as the Bible intends it to be.

            I like KDC. In the past, he's been smarter than me. He's good at what he does. I absolutely believe him, because he's been ... assisting? sniffing around? Assange for years. I am not privy to their discussions, but KDC has been aware and supportive of Assange for a long time. So this isn't meant as a criticism. But, KDC has his own difficulties (which I find specious) with the FBI.
            <a href="https://twitter.com/kimdotcom/status/582068295366410240?lang=en">
             He's tweeted about this
            </a>
            . If I wanted to ascribe self-serving motives to KDC, I'd say he's renegotiating his deal with the Federales. I'd be cynical, but KDC is as much a victim as Assange and somewhat more personable? realistic? If he can help himself through this, good. Maybe that's the timing.

            I think Dotcom, Assange, Trump, and basically anyone else accosted by the Left is working in a coordinated effort to bring down the elite, and all this timing is about making the media sound like idiots. They freak out and call bullshit to weeks on end, and just as they drop the subject, more revelations. It's really kinda brilliant.

               I’ve been saying that since he announced his candidacy. I have

                the ultimate list
               </a>
               of articles written about kikes being against him.
              </p>
              <p>
               But there’s zero reason to believe that he’s actually redpilled now.

           Dr Hyde and Mr Jekyll explains that degenerate brain can function in both normal and degenerate mode. The normal way in public and degenerate way in private or among other degenerates during judeo-satanist rituals.

It is plausible to presume that since the elite is usually displaced in the capital, which is London in case of Britain, both writers managed to understand something was not right with the elite in London, which made them write books explaining about degenerates and ways to detect them.

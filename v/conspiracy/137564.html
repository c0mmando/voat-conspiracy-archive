            I've seen both Montage of Heck, read the criticisms, and also watched Soaked in Bleach.
           </p>
           <p>
            You should definitely watch Soaked in Bleach!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also fascinating how hard the efforts to squash this movie are - that's actually what got my attention!  I'd previously seen Kurt and courtney and thought this was just a rehash - Kurt and Courntey is kind of shit so I didn't care much.  Turns out this is not kind of shit, it's kind of great.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example: the guy who was chief of police in Seattle during the 90's is outright in the film advocating to re-open the investigation, saying they fucking blew it.

             I wasn't sure what to expect from it but it was enlightening and certainly had some damning facts that would be hard to dispute. I haven't seen Kurt and Courtney but it sounds like I'm not missing out on much anyway. I think Courtney certainly made a mistake in hiring that private investigator to track Kurt down.

             I wouldn't know, I haven't heard of a "Courtney did it" movie in the pipeline. I just thought it was an interesting documentary and contained some thought provoking insight into the last few days of Curt Cobains life, mostly based on the testament from a private detective hired by Courtney to find Curt.

              There was a post I came across recently about a movie with the same name, I may have misunderstood and it could have actually been this documentary.
             </p>
             <p>
              It could be an interesting one. I've read several books on the subject, but they've only had passing remarks about the detectives involvement. Sadly YouTube sucks on my phone so I'll have to check it out another time.

               I think I have seen this one being touted around as soaked in bleach the movie too, so it probably is one and the same.

              <p>
               Definitely interesting though and worth a watch, it kind of revolves around the detective Courtney hired to find Curt, he practically narrates it throughout, basically giving his side of events. He also taped every phone call he had with Courtney at the time so there is plenty of the phone calls put in too.

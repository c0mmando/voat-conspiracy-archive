<p>i\'ve been off and on voat since 2015 and it\'s pretty sad to see so many here talk about \'muh rights\' and shit because; You really don\'t care about your rights because if you did, you wouldn\'t wait for someone else to stand up for them.

<p>look mate, face reality - you don\'t do anything at all except wait for someone else to stand up for your rights.  it\'s pretty sad to see so many here talk about \'muh rights\' and shit because if you really cared about them, you would have done something, if anything at all up to this point to stop them from getting stolen.</p>
<p>Getting your rights back is simple.  You just need to do something about it</p>

            The numbers just weren't there before they all started waking up and with a plan of action in play I'll not interfere with that until I see that it is not going to work any longer. The butterfly effect can just be far too risky to. It could be akin to swatting a wasp off the hand of a man handling nitroglycerin. If the swat don't do it the coming sting may just have explosively disastrous results.  So no. I sit and I wait and if I'm lucky I'll never have to get violent for our future. That does not mean I'm not prepared and willing to, though.

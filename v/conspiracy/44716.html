            Im not putting words in your mouth, or certainly not trying to, nor am I really addressig "you" as much as "you" as in "you all"....there is no governments, there are no countries....countries are monetary regions who are controlled by people who work for criminals because they were put there using the criminals network, in order to run a usury scam...but before we blame the criminals....the real crime is that this seemingly obvious crime is only perpetrated because people apparently don;t understand this, or they're just sick fucks and like it...

            when you say politiocs, I'm sure you mean "central banking"....lets review...
           </p>
           <p>
            your electing your "leaders" based on the tv telling you who you can vote for and when, then they tell you who won....this is your "poliics"..do we need o be reminded that the "media" that controls this fraudulent election process is owned by the banking corporations who just happen to get to be in charge of the creation of the money supply...and that when they are allowed to do this, they charge interest on money that they create from nowhere...
           </p>
           <p>
            So that sounds like a bunch of criminals figured out how to get you to fuck yourself, and frankly anyone who doesn;t see his obvious usury scam has a really low IQ....which I guess is the guys who run the show, cause there is no politics...theres just lies and stupid idiots who don;t understand crime

            Don't know anything about them, but openly touting yourself in such a manner "no agenda" makes me leery, EVERYONE has an agenda, it's what their agenda is and why that's important.

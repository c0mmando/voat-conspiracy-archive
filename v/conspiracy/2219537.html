<hr />
<p>I\'ve been trying to compile a theory that the far-left, led by Soros and his ilk, are setting the stage for civil war. The theory contends that they have positioned themselves into a win-win with Russiagate.</p>
<p>There are a few possible outcomes to Russiagate that I believe are plausible which I have attempted to outline below:</p>
<h3>Outcome 1</h3>
<p>The one outcome most Voaters probably would agree is most favorable is one where Mueller charges the Clintons, Podestas, Lynch, Comey, and possibly even Obama. This leads to Trump\'s administration putting these icons of the left in prison.</p>
<p>However, in my estimation, that would start a chain of events starting with the media trying to persuade the general public that this is the beginning of the fascist Trump regime taking control over America by throwing his opposition in prison. They\'d propose that we must rise up and oppose Trump or end up like Nazi Germany. This would be reinforced by the media\'s narrative that Trump is somehow complicit with white supremacy and nationalism. They will trumpet sound bites of different speeches to continue painting him as a white supremacist &quot;supporter&quot;, despite evidence existing to the contrary, and none existing in support of that idea. The end goal here being to incite a civil war hinged upon a racial divide. In reality, it would be more of a culture and ethics war. Minorities, simple minds, and degenerate progressives would side together against conservatives.</p>
<h3>Outcome 2</h3>
<p>The other outcome is that Mueller only charges people who were associated with Trump at some point, even if the charges have nothing to do with Trump - for example the Manafort indictment we\'ve already seen. I can see this going two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nothing happens to Manafort and he\'s basically let off the hook with light punishment. This would lead to the media proclaiming obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. Which leads into Trump\'s a fascist dictator taking over the government...yada yada yada. See Outcome 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manafort is severly punished, and the media uses this to &quot;prove&quot; that Trump is dirty and in bed with the Russians, which is basically what they are currently doing now. This could lead to them trying to move forward with impeachment, but I honestly don\'t think this is the direction that we will head. If impeachment did occur though, especially on something as fake as this, that would likely also lead to a civil war uprising, only by Trump supporters (there are a lot of them) instead of the far-left and those undecided mindless zombies still controlled by MSM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Observations I\'ve made to support this conspiracy theory:</h4>
<ol>
<li>People still largely gathering all their information from the MSM and their social media echo chambers.</li>
<li>Clinton implicated in Uranium One as a key player, along with Manafort, Lynch, Comey, and Obama.</li>
<li>Soros moves all his assets to private foundation that has been tied to supporting domestic terrorist groups like Antifa.</li>
<li>Antifa widely speculated to be planning some kind of armed revolution for Nov. 4th (date could change potentially).</li>
<li>Information starting to filter out that Mueller might be getting ready to charge Tony Podesta, and more to come.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that Soros and his ilk have maneuvered themselves into this position on the chess board where they get a favorable outcome no matter what happens.</p>
<p>I would contend that Soros is getting his funds ready to finance a major war.</p>
<h3>Why do they want civil war?</h3>
<p>The outcome of civil war is twofold in my estimation. First, they want to reduce the world population. Although civil war in the United States would probably only lead to tens of millions dead, maybe a hundred million, it could start a cascading effect rippling across other nations around the world. Second, they hope to destroy the white race. By pitting the world\'s minority groups against whites in wholesale, they hope to make this civil war about race. The end goal, if ending in their favor, would be the dramatic reduction of whites. Those remaining would be loyal to the elimination of whites through breeding with the Negroid with the eventual goal to create a subservient race of subjects who can easily be satisfied so long as they are provided <strong>Bread and Circuses</strong>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A lot of this conspiracy just joins together other topics I have seen around Voat. It borrows bits and pieces of news that seem to reinforce the idea that these <em>society planners</em>, like Soros, are simply moving pieces on a chess board, and, with the help of his think tanks, has possibly thought 3 or 4 moves ahead of us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this theory plausible?</li>
<li>Is there evidence to rebut it?</li>
<li>Is there further evidence in support of it?</li>
<li>What can we do with this knowledge in hand?</li>
</ul>
<p>This might only be the tip of the iceberg to some of you, but I haven\'t really seen this angle posited outright before. Therefore, I posit it here with the hopes that fellow Voaters will help me build on it or dismiss it entirely.</p>
<p>It seems this conspiracy theory requires that the left have control over the general public\'s mind, thus, the only thing possibly that we can do is to continue manufacture and distribution of red pills to literally everyone we meet.</p>',

            For the latest Intel, stay tuned in to Victory of the Light (Edit to take out she he created hyperlink). What VoTL publishes aligns with what ends up happening. Here's the

           <p>
            Many of these folks (with direct access to ATS info) are communicating in the background, it's no coincidence you're seeing coverage of Russia gate, since the white hats used what Hillary's PR team devised to distract. The reality is that just like what Steve Pieczniak stated on his YouTube channel, along with various leaked sources like Wikileaks, the cabal is going down, one by one. They are desperate, hence the totally botched Las Vegas incident, which was predicted by many within a few weeks. You'll see more mysterious LV witnesses dying, this is how they cover their tracks. They need to control the narrative, anti-multiple shooter theories for ex. The count is now 6 I believe.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many signs they are despair ate. See Lynn Rothschild tweet to J. Podesta - completely laying all blame on him. At her level, why would she do this? It was a sign for operatives that that family control, he's open game now, he is 100% dark side, and will probably be offed, just like Justice Scalia in a plane, before they can get him before a grand jury. Prince Philip resigned! What British royalty do you know resigned? And those murdered like Diana don't count. They milk their position for all its worth until their dying day. T. Podesta resigned his lobbying group position. These are just a few recent examples.
           </p>
           <p>
            Russiagate was designed by Hillary's PR team during the debates. Remember when she cited 17 intelligence agency reports? That was pulled out of thin air, in desparation against Trump citing Wikileaks, then they had to perpetuate this entire sham. Think about it, all developed nations are hacking each other, especially during national debates, it goes without saying. It was intended as a distraction, but gave white hat agents in intelligence agencies amunition to investigate and leverage all that juicy PR against them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the flood gates have cracked and cabal members around OUR globe are trembling at the site of the dam giving way.

            You are a shill. We've had quality information technology since 2000. After living through 9/11 at 25 years old, none of this drama is going to cause me to kill another American for a "civil war" over an election or politics!! Yes.. my home and properties will remain protected with an arsenal of curated weapons. And the TV will remain OFF.  #MAGA

             I'm not sure if this is sarcasm. Forgive me if it is. If it's not, however, what will you do when they start coming for your arsenal? What will you do when your fellow "American's" start trampling on the freedoms that make you American, and start demanding that you give up your guns? Will you kill another American then, or just let them take them and hope to win them back in court someday?

             I outline why they'd want civil war. It reduces population, and leads to the eradication of the white race (if they win).

              Eradication of the white race is the main goal. They see other races as mongoloids that are easily controlled. Just look at BLM. Whites don’t have the same herd mentality and this is a problem to them. There’s only one race that can push back against them and that’s who’s getting forced multiculturalism right now. They wanted to divide the US into two separate countries with the civil war. It didn’t work and now it’s time for a second try.

               Well, that's what Soros aims to fix with his billions of funding, though that might not be anywhere near enough to arm enough people. There are a lot of "them". Obviously I'm under no delusion that any Jews would get swept up in the fighting. They are employing degenerates, cucks, and minorities to do the fighting for them.

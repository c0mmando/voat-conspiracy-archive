<p>I have been thinking about the people who choose to accept refugees. I wonder what they think about when making their decisions.</p>
<p>Does each individual country decide to accept refugees?</p>
<p>Does every member of the European Union <em>have</em> to take in a minimum number of refugees? And if so, how was that decided?</p>
<p>I read that migrant crime has been high in Sweden for some decades. According to some sources, the migrant crime rate in Sweden has &quot;skyrocketed&quot; since the migrant crisis.</p>
<p>What are the Swedish decision makers thinking? According to a based Redditor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They\'re thinking, &quot;It\'s intolerant to acknowledge that immigrants commit more crimes than others, so we won\'t do it.&quot; They\'re thinking, &quot;If we hide the truth from people long enough and call anybody who opposes unfiltered mass migration names, we can keep our jobs.&quot; They\'re thinking, &quot;The public is too stupid to know what\'s good for it so I will decide for them.&quot;</p>
<p>It\'s worth significant consideration that many of the events described in this BBC article we are commenting on, specifically the physical attacks on migrants by the right-wing gang, never happened. A single far left Swedish media outlet made the claim migrants were attack, then immediately was cited as source by the mainstream Swedish news sources, which then were cited by the BBC (an institution which has presented a bias view on the migrant crisis from day one). Yesterday a Stockholm police report was released to the general public which revealed that not a single person reported being attacked by the gang other than a police officer who tried to arrest one of its members. They reported only &quot;disturbing the peace&quot; and &quot;handing out leaflets&quot;.</p>
<p><a href="http://newobserveronline.com/stockholm-attack-invented-by-controlled-media/">http://newobserveronline.com/stockholm-attack-invented-by-controlled-media/</a>[1]</p>
<p>These people are lying, covering up their incompetence, and manipulating the public with fabricated scare-stories. People are getting incredibly angry with their governments all across Europe and I do not see this situation lightening unless politicians stop ignoring what people want and start listening to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe it is a plausible theory.</p>
<p>When I picture this happening, I think that the decision makers are aware of the high violent crime rate of the migrant population. Given those facts, they still decide that it is good to allow those people in to the country. They could calculate the number of violent crimes that will be commited by the new migrant population, and then decide that it is low enough as to be acceptable.</p>
<p>What if the public were presented with estimates of future crime rates; based on varying numbers of incoming migrants, and then allowed to vote on the number of migrants to accept? Should this type of decision be allowed to go to a vote?</p>
<p>Conspiracy time: What if increased violent migrant crime is the goal? Who would benefit from that and how? Did they manufacture the entire migrant crisis? If so, how?</p>
<p>I am so uninformed that I couldn\'t begin to answer those questions. I don\'t know the history of the Syrian conflict, so I will go read about that next.</p>',

            Those who make these decisions don't have to personally deal with the migrants, worst case scenario they fuck off to an out of country property paid for via taxes from the people they're supposed to represent. Those in power are not the same as you and I, they do not care about these things as it does not effect them directly.  These people aren't in office for the good of the people, some may be but they don't get very far in the end. Worship greed, nothing else.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing flooding Europe with people with huge culture differences is going to do is degenerate what reasonable culture they have left so it can either be replaced with another more easily controlled culture. Mix everyone up, Make everyone the same, have everyone worship the same entity. Easily control the populace. Kill/shame anyone who opposes, currently in western culture if you even attempt to rock the boat both sides of the line will come to push you around. Its hard times but we can fight through it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Europe is only the beginning. Prepare yourselves accordingly.

            It made a lot of sense to me, seems like they are purposefully making trouble so they can put together a suggestion for a one world government where it would be so much easier to control/manipulate the masses and resources

            I talked to a Swede in a grindcore band awhile back. He said there was a huge middle eastern migrant panic (this was long before the refugee crisis) and he said it had gotten to the point that police wouldn't stop people on the street anymore asking for papers or identification for fear of offending people/being seen as racist and not being politically correct. The feminists are also taking over the country, it's fucked. Sad to say at one point in my life I really wanted to live there.

            Classic war strategy.
1. Flood target country with immigrants through actual or created crisis.
2. Sit back and laugh as target country collapses from flood of migrants.
3. Take over country, restore order, and be hailed the conquering hero.

            You know. I never did consider it being about giving Isreal some breathing room for their holy land bullshit.

            I just figured it was about the middle east off loading their dead weight or weaponizing their poor citizens. Pretty clever way to eat up the enemies resources.

            I think some mean well, just want to help those in need. But they are doing it too blindly.

            Not deporting or punishing the violent criminals however, that makes no sense to me.

            I just read an article from Zerohedge that explains the situation dang close to my opinion on the matter.

            If you really,
            <strong>
             REALLY
            </strong>
            , want to understand what is going on in the world, may I suggest two books written by the same author named John Perkins: Confessions of an economic hitman, and The secret history of the American empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            It will cover his experience on how he corrupted leaders around the world, and turned nations into a safe-haven for multinational corporations to expand and exploit. The books themselves can be read by teenagers, it has this insight of how he felt doing all this, but you can sense a strong regret of his actions while reading. It's really good, totally recommended. I remember him meeting with Dalai Lama where he (Dalai Lama) said "don't be a buddhist...just be compassionate!". That's something that kinda stuck with me.
           </p>
           <p>
            It covers a lot, from CIA coups to how corporations use humanistic organisations like red-cross, to how some nations leaders are completely cornered like a check-mate position in which if they don't do what corporations want them to do they will take them out along with their country. It explains IMF, and for the migration crisis, it explains how important oil is. It also explains a conflict between the royal family and wahabists (those who believe strictly in the Koran) in Saudi Arabia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I really really recommend this IF you are interested. You will definitely get a new world-view. The migration crisis in short is nothing but a stage, the real goal is...well...I'll let you decide xd

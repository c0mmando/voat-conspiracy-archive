            The CDC has been repeatedly wrong about everything, I don't trust their conclusions on this, I'll look to an international consensus formed by aggregate data. Aggregate data from countries which have used universal masking from the start shows extremely low infection rates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anti-maskers cant refute Japan's low infection rate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masks are easy and people who don't want to wear them are prissy little drama queens and snow flakes. I've worn these styles of masks for years while wood working and I'm an asthmatic, the worst part about wearing them is having to readjust them. If these masks give you trouble walking around at walmart you should probably get your fat ass a mobility scooter and wear the mask because your poor cardio respiratory endurance is the biggest risk factor for any illness especially respiratory illnesses.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS a review of a study or series if studies is just as crap as the studies. The proof is in the pudding, masking nations have dramatically lower infection rates, if it were some other factor like genetic resistance or herd immunity we wouldn't see similar mortality rates to the west, masking nations have mortality rates in line with non masking nations which have behaved similarly, save the masks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Im sure some fuckup will confuse mortality rates and percentile death tolls as constantly happens on voat but be prepared to be embarrassed for being a fucking retard if you pretend the mortality rates is a fraction of a percent. Mortality for the virus is about 4% at this time.

              I'll get vaccinated when I know we have a safe vaccine, no sooner, likely years after the first one is put out.

                I think you are projecting your fear onto my rational predictions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most of you anti mask losers are just frightened by a reality that scares you, viruses, nor masks, nor vaccines, nor microchips scare me. I respond rationally to mass suffering from the virus and our poor reactions to it by wearing a mask i saw the reports on 8kun in january and bought some extra masks, shit was obvious to anyone paying attention. I actually understand the problems with vaccines unlike most of you quasi literate fuck ups who have opinions roughly as nuanced as "pointy needle bad" I'm not a toddler, nor do I expect over vaccination, and I wont accept a vaccine for myself untill I recognize it's safe and wont sterilize me but I'm going to tell my older relatives to take the second or third round of vaccines. And when it comes to microchipping I'm not putting up with it, I'll die before tolerating this taking any sort of hold.
               </p>
               <p>
                Its time to face reality and stop acting like a petulant child afraid to acknowledge an inconvenient reality.
               </p>
               <p>
                This mask shit is the most retarded hill to die on because even if the virus were fake and a crafted narrative being anti mask would still make you look profoundly hypocritical over any pretense of a pro life stance.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anti maskers have lost embarrassingly at this game of political chess mostly because you let vain old women who drive the q movement draw this line in the sand. The proper line in the sand was poorly vetted mandatory vaccines, the hardline was micro chips, drawing so many lines makes you look weak. And when the libes get crossed you look incompetent and even weaker and you lose huge amounts of political sway. Anti maskers bet on the wrong horse out of hubris and political and social incompetence. Frankly I'm glad the public can see most of you as the unthinking, selfish, hypocrites you lot are, unfortunately they mistake you for actual right wingers like me who believe in action and direct and orderly policies which react to reality.

            I was in a pyramid scheme for 9 months, and let me tell you, they use this tactic all the time to retain their "recruits". First is the inoculation against your family members' criticisms, then friends, then actual businesspeople, then other pyramid schemes. They tell you what these people are going to tell you, and how that SHOULD make you feel. Then when these caring people in your life voice their concern about how you've been changing, you can comfortably and nonchalantly brush them off.

            What I take from what he's saying is not that nasty words should be forbidden, but that people should know what effect those nasty words have, and also be aware that those nasty words can be weaponized by the opposition to keep regular people away.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that the nastiness of voat can keep regular people away. The question is whether it's being used by the opposition to keep people away from Voat. I don't know of any way to really determine that other than dissatisfied shills leaking information about what they're being paid to do, along with proof of some sort. I know there are paids shills on the Internet, but I have no idea of the extent of the problem.

            I'm saying that voat was attacked.  It was seen as a threat and thus inoculation was used as a method to paint voat as a hostile environment.  By educating more people to the methods used, perhaps we can be better at spotting them and addressing them when they happen.  Using voat itself just happens to be an example of the method in action.
           </p>
           <p>
            This isn't about babying people and creating safe spaces, but about an underhanded tactic used to smear voat as well as attack other venues or ideologies.  Just because you wear voat's smear with pride (as do I to some degree) doesn't change the fact that it appears to have been an astroturf movement to damage voat.  Discussing hurt fee fees is getting distracted and missing the entire point except perhaps to say you were one of the polarized people and you like being manipulated.

            I'm not saying racist and hateful remarks should be taboo, but they clearly are perceived as such and those remarks can be used to steer people away from voat.  I suspect during incidents where there were large migrations there were huge spikes in racist/hateful comments beyond what you might expect from normal users and this was a hostile action taken to discredit voat.

            Seems like you're really onto something. I can think of countless examples that this could fit, right off the top of my head. Hell, one could even say that Amalek is an example of this. (Although he probably doesn't intend to be.)

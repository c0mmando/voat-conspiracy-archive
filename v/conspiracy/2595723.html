            Conspiracy theories are CIA concoctions designed to fill peoples memory holes with half truths so they can't form a real resistance against their cabalist paymasters agenda. Being half-truths and disinformation, people seeking truth and justice can be labelled conspiracy theorists and ridiculed. This is where the disinfo agents and LARPers come in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate has been a litmus test as to who these disinfo agents are and what the agenda is - to use the western world as a loss making operation for Israeli expansionist gains.

            Aliens and myths were fine when the economis were booming, but now people are seeing their economies collapsing and their media being turned over to psychological warfare they aren't so much fun anymore. People are waking up.

            Those conspiracies are mostly like "flat earth" psyop campaigns designed to distract truth seeker personality types.

            Who is behind the psy ops and disinfo campaigns is why shit has gotten "political".

            The whole site is a political shit storm.  It's like the winds of shit whipped up into a shit tornado and covered everything and in the corner is a jew with diarheah running down his leg saying it was the fellow white man over there that's to blame for everything being covered in shit.  It is what it is...
           </p>
           <p>
            That said I saw a flying triangle up close once.  Dead set that fucker was insane and no more than 30m away at it's closest point.  Feel free to ask me anything about it though I warn you I'm pretty drunk as is and likely to pass out and wake up severely hung over so my replies might be delayed but they'll be truthful and as detailed as I can make them.

              Fuck sobriety, what do you want to know?  I have a post way back in my history that's probably too far back to find that explains everything I saw perfectly but I'll tell you what you want to know all the same.

               <p>
                Late June, 30th I believe, 2011 about 200km east of Melbourne in Victoria Australia. 8pm-ish
               </p>
               <p>
                To be honest I was intoxicated, I had a few drinks and a couple of bong hits as I was celebrating.  In fact had it not been for the celebration I wouldn't have gone outside on my back deck to smoke a cigar with a friend.  So yeah we had a buzz going but weren't wasted and definitely saw the same thing.  What happened was we were out there smoking the cigar when the triangle barely flew above my house.  It was seriously no more than 30m away from us and by the time I looked up it was already just past me but not enough that I couldn't get a good look at it.  The sides were very round like a semi circle and ribbed with very dark metallic ribbons all around.  I couldn't see how they went above the ship but it definitely looked like they made rings that went both inside and outside the ship from underneath.  Each corner had a dome that was segmented into 4 bits which looked like the angles of a peace symbol except that they met at a ring about 2/3 the way to the top of the dome instead of each other.  So 3 splits, 1 circle per dome and there was one in each corner and a massive one in the middle of the triangle that was easily 5x as large.  They all looked identical being a dull metallic dark grey colour that was about half way between the colour of the body and the ribs going around the border of the craft.  The body itself was a light grey colour and made of bits that were all made of right angles but like a maniac glued together a bunch of squares and rectangles together at random.  No piece between the domes or edge looked identical in any way.  They were all unique in their size and shape but fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.
               </p>
               <p>
                So seeing this craft I looked at my mate who was in a state of shock and horror and knowing that he was seeing the same shit I was I looked back at it only to hear a mighty roar in the distance.  It was at that point I noticed that the triangle didn't make any noise, didn't displace the air or anything like that in the slightest.  The triangle kept going into the distance while the roar got louder and LOUDER until finally an F-15/18 type jet came screaming in from the south, banked hard to the right and begun chasing the triangle.  The triangle kept on it's path but seemingly sped up as it got further out as the jet got louder but never seemed to keep up with it.  Eventually they both disappeared over the horizon and we went back inside.  I told my now ex about it and she thought I was full of shit until my friend confirmed it and not even 5 minutes later he took off back home.

                 The triangle type like that have been showing up a lot lately. The fact the military got involved is a tad more disturbing since that would mean they aren't cooperating unlike some other species or factions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do wonder why the military bothers to chase them though. They cannot catch them or even shoot them down unless they allow it (should some sort of trap be set that actually works... you just picked a fight with someone who can step on the entire human race). Those craft are built for interstellar travel and most definitely can traverse immense distances quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Short version: that isn't one of our craft.

                  They chase them because it would be a hell of a prize to get one.  I have to admit it looked man made though but with technology the likes of which I've never seen before.  It was clearly manufactured by some form of intelligence which means if it wasn't one of ours it has to have been made by a species similar to us in that they've had to work out the physics, mine the materials, make a computer to control it all, come up with an insane power supply and then build it in a factory which isn't something a few individuals can't do.  Getting to that point takes generations of cooperation and determining you have the right over nature to take control over any part you see fit as the mining of materials alone would fuck the local area over.  That means they hold their lives above that of the world around them and will simply take what they want, when they want it and won't stop even if it means a lesser being gets fucked over for it which would obviously include us.  Attacking them would therefor be retarded but my guess is that instead of using conventional weapons on them our guys are trying to act like cylons and hack them from a distance so they can crash the ship and make it seem like an accident.  That way we can render assistance, get our hands on the technology and should another ship appear claim that we didn't fire a single missile or bullet on it at all but only gave chase and if we are to blame for it going down it's because of a radio signal mix up or some kind of accident like that.

                   The materials would be easier to mine in space. For the most part they won't be aggressive. A naturally aggressive species would have a very hard time uniting as those have to accomplish such technological feats (look at humans.). Also, I suspect their technological development has been at least 1 million years longer than ours.

                    Acquiring the materials in space may be easier but refining and working them would be far easier to do on a planet with gravity than it would in space because even the most basic of things like heat spreads out in all directions instead of going mostly upwards like it does on a planet.  It would be completely impractical to refine metals in space even if you could overcome that as well because you need to remove impurities and slag which float which are easy to scrape off when you have gravity but would coat the outside of the ball the molten metal forms in space.  Then there's all the pollution and shit that would fill their ships so I personally think they'd get materials from space as needed but definitely work them on the surface of a planet they could breathe on.  As for their aggressive natures you don't get to be top dog on your planet without taking control of the environment by removing it's influence on you.  Some common factors would be shelters to protect from the weather and fences to keep animals out and that's if they're peaceful and didn't just wipe the threat out entirely.  They also need to eat which definitely means they're ok with killing because higher lifeforms like ourselves can only survive by consuming other forms of life.  Because of their needs of space, shelter, food, etc. I think they'd have a capitalistic society very much like our own.  Then again they might be so advanced that each child has their own star trek type replicator made for them when they're born and they never need to worry about anything but I'd be more willing to wager that they work jobs like we do for money too.

                    I don't believe they've come here to start a fight, mine the earth, to have sexual relations, etc.  My personal belief is that they like trying new food and take dna samples so they can replicate the plants and animals they've encountered as their technology is clearly better than ours.  They have no need to be scared of us but at the same time don't make their presence undeniably felt so it's like they're trying to keep things on the down low instead of enslaving us, working their own factories, extracting resources, etc. but clearly they have to want something otherwise they wouldn't be here.  They have no need of our religion, knowledge or forms of entertainment that wouldn't relate to them in the slightest so the only thing that makes any sense to me is that they want something unique and the only unique thing this planet has is the life that's on it.  They might find some use for plants as a medicine or whatever but I'd wager they're more bored of eating the same shit and know that it's fucking retarded importing foreigners so instead of bringing us to them they're taking samples of everything and making their own recipes up based on their tastes.

                     They have artificial gravity. As for disposal of the materials they don't want, they probably don't produce any waste. Their tech allows them to utilize everything. From what little I know of their materials in ships, they can essentially make thread from metals and just weave that shit together. That level of control means whatever waste they make can be equally utilized in some way. Also, there's no way they built these ships planet side. Some stuff actually requires 0g. So it'd be easier to have the facility in space where the gravity generator can simply be turned down/off on command.

                     As for conflict and food needs, do not try to project onto these species. It doesn't work. Some of them are most definitely constructs which were built and designed solely for long term near 0g environmental exposure. The others likely evolved where cooperation was king for survival. That is not to say some did not have evolution paths that take the violent route, but even those probably prefer to not do it.

                     DNA would be something they would collect. Though the motive would be something unknown. Their thought process is completely different than ours (truly alien).

            Voat's userbase is overwhelmingly people who've left other sites due to censorship, and it's to me no surprise they want to continue talking about those censored subject. That makes Voat very interesting when it comes conspiracies involving censorship or conspiracies being actively censored. Particularly PizzaGate/The Great Awakening who has several active and independent subvoats. Also ze jews. God damn space jews crawling out of some peoples assholes judging by their posts.

            Also, has there been any significant habbenings within the ET field since To The Stars Academy (Tom DeLonge) was exposed as a money grab on top of probably being gov't controlled? Any recent alien revelations from the US government (re: video releases) is a bit too late as the Twining Memo established that the US was into this very real phenomena 70 years ago. Wake me up when something new happens, this field is just like any serious Q research, you'll have to wait for more info to be able to progress your understanding.

            or a threat is made against a person's family who would normally not be complicit, and he does it to save his family while they are all in a foreign country and a position of not being able to get help. i honestly believe that the non's are a dying crowd. they have been pulling pedophiles into these services for a while, a lot of the original anonymous hackers were pedophiles and were spared prison sentences if they worked for the FBI. these guys were all much more talented than the current FBI members were.

            old 4 chan used to get a whole lot of child porn, the FBI gets a whole lot of child porn. they can identify and grab people who are picking up child porn. let's say they are looking for someone who will join their little circus. FBI doesn't bust everybody they catch doing these things. how many are secretly recruited into elite circles instead of arrested?

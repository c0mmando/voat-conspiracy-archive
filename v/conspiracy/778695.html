            Your reaponse is so personal. Sorry you have so many feels to attach to your world view. I don't play wow. And I ran cross country in my day. Averaging 50 miles a week. So, you keep saying buzz words and making assumptions. Because the phase" conspiracy theory" triggers irrational disbelief in something completely possible I tend to think you probably believe everything anyone of authority has ever told you. How was that assumption? I at least used your previous statement as context for this one. Unlike you, who pulled yours out of your ass. But I'm the nutter?
           </p>
           <p>
            You didn't seem to understand what I was saying either. I was commenting on poor observational tools in humans. Which is why your assumptions come off as arrogant. Because you're not acknowledging poor human perceptions that leave more unanswered questions in their observations than answers. This is just the nature of our limited point of view as organisms tied to primitive organic organs that don't gather sensitive data very well, or without bias. We may see patterns where they may not exist, or be oblivious of a pattern that repeats over and over right in our midst. That what being human is. To suggest that human rules and laws are infallible for any reason is absurdly childish. Just like your attempts at getting me to care about how you feel about the validity of theories that you dismiss on the basis of my weight and gaming habits.
           </p>
           <p>
            I might believe in some crazy things. But I don't need to debase you to tell you why. The fact that you feel you need to resort to such behavior is interesting. I hope you have real reasons as to why you disbelieve something so thoroughly, something that is nothing more than a possibility. Just like any other theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why so personal? What is it to you if human knowledge is incomplete? I can't even tell what your opinion is other than you don't feel good when people contradict your point of view. Sorry you don't feel good, but you haven't dismissed anything here successfully. You just threw a fit.

            Here you go - :
           </p>
           <p>
            "Magnetics' is just gravity at frequency everything is 'magnetic' or nothing is magnetic and everything is gravity at frequency.
           </p>
           <p>
            actually both don't really exist all that exists is inertia in a field.
           </p>
           <p>
            this inertia causes a 'magnetic' or gravity effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            'magnets' can be seen as 'gravity lenses of specific resonate frequency.
           </p>
           <p>
            that's it it's as simple as that, you can make something 'fall' into a vortex forever you can do this a 100 different ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            that's 'Free energy' it's just the same 'Free energy' that is causing the earth to spiral around the sun.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your life is a fake construct very similar to the 'Matrix' in fact that movie was a purposeful joke. 
don't believe me sit down with a pen and paper and write down all the things you KNOW are true and real.
come back here and ask me about them.

            maybe but it isn't as relevant as you may think one of the earliest dated 'free energy' devices patent was purchased in 1902 -

            You're deliberately not entertaining something that in reality could be true. Human perception is very poor, even when  aided by tools. This is due to our short life spans, and simple mechanisms of observation. It's not that you're wrong, it's that you're so arrogant at being technically right.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being right on a technicality doesn't make your observations or world view any wider or more accurate. Your outlook on reality is rigid and held up by rules that you cling to as the gospel truth, like a religious person might when confronted about existence of God.
           </p>
           <p>
            No, there's a lot for us to learn, and it's likely some of the conceived truths of our time are just small pieces to a much larger puzzle, and so are more like fractions of the truth. Knowing that, you shouldn't be so keen to put yourself on the righteous rail to infallible logic town. Because there is nothing perfect about our understanding of even our immediate surroundings. Check your sentient organism privilege man. Just because you can think, doesn't make your hold on reality accurate. It's more likely that we don't comprehend the nature of our existence or even the space that we occupy.

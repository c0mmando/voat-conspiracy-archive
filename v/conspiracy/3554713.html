            Day of Deceit is the definitive book proving that Pearl Harbor was a planned event to get the USA into the war.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's why the aircraft carriers were not there that day. Mot of the rest of the ships were repaired in a few weeks.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Jeb Bush in his Project foe The New American Century document written years before 9/11/2001 said we needed another pearl harbor type event to make it all possible  he wasn't referring to a sneak attack. He was referring to another planned disaster like Pearl Harbor.

             Jeb Bush was lined up to be the President in 2016. At the start of the campaign he had more funding from the people who back both sides than Hillary. This funding metric had been the common factor in who was going to win the presidency for all the preceding elections since WWII.

            Yeah, you're going to get bombarded like the USS Indianapolis for it, but the crowd needs to know some things.
           </p>
           <p>
            A scapegoat was needed. One who'd stfu about the fact that it was "an event" to be used.
           </p>
           <p>
            That scapegoat was was named Kimmel.

            The Man Show was an attempt to create belief in 'toxic masculinity'...............

            Real lives lost.

           <p>
            You don't completely fake such a thing.

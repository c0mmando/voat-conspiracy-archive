            It brings up infinite regression conflicts. Unless you're going to say that one person is in control of everything, can't die and also knows everything, but that's just make believe, right?

            0%. The many worlds interpretation is the most likely, which means that travel to the past is irrelevant, as you’re not traveling to YOUR universe’s past to change anything, simply to another’s.

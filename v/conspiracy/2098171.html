            most analysts aren't on the creative side, and truth is stranger than fiction. easier to emulate in order to infiltrate.

            Good question. There is a lot of bot activity nowadays and still humans of course, but trending down imo. So if you argue with one to a certain point, it doesn't know what to say, so goes random. There was one bot on another site, that if cornered would always say the same phrase: I'm just a twelve-year-old schoolboy blah-blah.

             that's a bot though. I was curious on analyzing the hand-typed words of people and their personalities and word/slang choices and misspellings... bots still aren't nearly true AI yet, so you can easily run them out of options. its similar to a command-line program in Linux, it will respond to -xuisvtfg whatever... but eventually something isn't programmed into it.

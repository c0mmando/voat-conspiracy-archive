<p>I am writing this correspondence to inform people that I am finally disseminating a project that I have been working on for the last few years. I have now published a book that I have written: <em>Of Personal Liberty, The Truth of Motor Vehicle Infractions</em>. If you have any time to spare, I’d greatly appreciate your audience for my work. </p>
<p>What is my book about? Well, first off, I want to assert that my book is NOT a discussion about how to get out of traffic tickets. Rather and more importantly, my book aims to examine the legitimacy of traffic tickets, and in doing so teach people fundamental principles of law that everyone should know.</p>
<p>At its core, my book is a discussion about freedom—in practical use. Specifically, the book enunciates the fact that if a person is free, they don’t need to ask for anyone’s permission before inclining to act. Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a ‘license’ or ‘permit’ (permission) from the government.</p>
<p>One of the many freedoms that have been deprived from Americans is their right to freely travel upon the highways. For a long time, we have been told that “driving is a privilege”, but this is a grave misnomer. My central thesis is that people should not be forced to obtain a license (ask government’s permission) nor meet other prerequisites before being allowed to privately travel upon the highways. </p>
<p>Our country’s backbone was designed to support a free society. Requiring everyone to get a driver’s license before they can travel upon the highways has led to a form of scoliosis; Constitutional provisions have been grossly reinterpreted, and basic principles of fairness (due process) are being ignored, in order to sustain our current trafficking system.  
</p>
<p>I’ve put thousands of hours of work into this book. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am diligent when it comes to my projects. I wouldn’t disseminate a publication unless I felt it met an acceptable standard of quality. I’m ready to share my book for dialectic.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. If you’d like to be the envy of your friends with your legal savvy, if you care about the subject of natural rights, or if you simply need a new coaster for your drinking mug, you should buy a copy of my book. It will be unlike any other book you’ve read. </p>

            There are too many people that are currently allowed to drive that shouldn't be on the roads. You want to allow the rest? The way the roads have evolved have currently made them into a very dangerous place. While certain rules are over the top, allowing everyone to drive is a bit much.

             Laws have never prevented shitty drivers. Worried about being hit? Well you can't control other people so then buy insurance and a dash cam. Anything that you do to stop someone from driving is impeding on their personal sovereignty which extends to property (the car).

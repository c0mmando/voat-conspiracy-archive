Everything we understand must be looked at in a new way.why do i say this? i say this because of the double slit experiment. we have seen that our own observation can change the way particles can behave. perhaps there is a higher part of our selves which operates in a light spectrum far outside of both the measurable and perceivable.a higher self that can influence things we see from our perspective. maybe its time to explore the unknown.</p>',

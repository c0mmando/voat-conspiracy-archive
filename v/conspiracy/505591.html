            Not to mention all of the fallacies that you have just committed in your statement, but freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom as long as you agree... People all around this world have different opinions and most of those opinions come from no actual knowledge of the truth of the situation... So when you see someone make a stupid statement know that they probably don't know what you know and try to help educate that person, not get all butt hurt and yell like this place is the reason for your anger... Take your venom somewhere else because we here see right through it...  Bongfury out

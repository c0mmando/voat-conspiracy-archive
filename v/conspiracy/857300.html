            I don't have the resources for that. Besides, I believe this to be space based weapons.

            I moved across the country and it stopped for about 8 months. I don't believe this to be a boots on the ground operation. I believe we each have a unique EM fingerprint, that allows them to tune into each of us like a radio station.

            Faith is good. I know there aren't supernatural forces battling for control of my soul, but it's good to remember the faith I had in humanity and the universe when I'm at low points.

            I have Faith. Unfortunately, I am constantly convulsing and twitching with my face contorting. It feels like there are magnetic bbs surging through my skull, jaw, and brain. They have the power to do horrible things with directed energy weapons and just giving your soul to God doesn't make it stop. They'll have to answer for it all When the Man Comes Around.

            Doing bad. I have voices warning me other voices are Satan. An ex-CIA scientist who worked on this tech said SATAN is an AI and an acronym for silent assassinations through amplified neurons. He's not religious at all but experienced the same thing. I didn't believe they were supernatural in any way, which is good. I suspect many people actually fall for that. They try to get them to anyways. I have constant convulsions and ttwitcching that all experts have drawn  a blank on, so I'm pretty much out of commission. I've told my family an they don't believe me, so I've gone along with their suggestions and have tried over a dozen anti-psychotics. None of them work except to dampen the fear and anxiety. Just trying to spread the word and get through the days the best I can. May take some online computer classes in an effort to be able to be a contributing member of society again. Used to be an English prof.

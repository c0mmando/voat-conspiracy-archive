            Land is cheap in Detroit... You can buy whole city blocks for pennies and then build a modern facility there that will make workers move there.

            Easier explanation would be a pending gentrification. Areas like these have had Democrats in power so long that they've been taxed into oblivion and have a massive and growing available work force desperate for any pay at all. With nowhere for the political pendulum to swing but right, future governors willing to promise companies anything to bring them into the state, lower taxes, fewer regulations, and state funded job training makes these areas ripe for massive profits through labor cost and tax savings. Contrarily you have corporate white flight from the increasingly taxed and restrictive silicon valley.
           </p>
           <p>
            These companies are simply "flipping houses" just as they did in the beginning of the tech boom in California when California offered immense financial incentives to set up shop there.
           </p>
           <p>
            An example of the lengths states will go to attract these companies away from silicon valley is Iowa's
            <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/08/24/iowa-approves-tax-breaks-for-apple-data-center-as-rep-ryan-holds-tax-talk-at-boeing.html">
             $208M bid to attract Apple. And in return Apple is only offering 50 jobs.
            </a>
            The Iowa governor and state legislature think it's a good idea to force the citizenry to essentially pay $40,160,000 so that one person can have a job at Apple. You can bet some decision makers are getting a big bonus this year. And Iowa is nowhere near as desperate as Michigan.

            Amazon recently set up a new
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/10/announcing-the-aws-us-east-ohio-region/">
             Amazon Web Services software region in Ohio
            </a>
            as an alternative to their very outdated and occasionally failing North Virginia region. So they already have a major data center their to support. Additionally, I suspect Amazon is targeting more cities for their many, many, local services such as: Amazon Fresh, Amazon Restaurants, Amazon Flex, Amazon Prime Now. Not every city has every one of these services yet, especially in the Midwest. Also fuck Amazon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Microsoft in Detroit? Hadn't heard. But might be a PR stunt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both companies have more than enough resources to buy up media in those areas without actually operating there. In fact, it would be more of a conspiracy to prove they've already done so.
           </p>
           <p>
            What could be better than getting "diverse" cities more aware of your products locally and indoctrinate them for life at the behest of corporate profits?

             they might if they wanted to exploit a muslim workforce for something. Dearborn is a nexus of theirs, and is essentially a satellite of Detroit.

            I'm pretty sure the detriot and clevland metro areas are pretty solidly blue. I don't see how new jobs for the big cities is going to change the voting map. Might be a business decision to build there, would you want to build anything in SF?

             I suspect it is propaganda purposes. They go to the blue cities because those guys will tow the corporate political line, while saying "we brought jerbs to your state!!!"

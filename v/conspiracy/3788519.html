            In the words of George Carlin: Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are even stupider than that.

            We can't do anything about that, people will be willfully ignorant until their dying breaths. The most we can do is take care of ourselves and our loved ones.. There's no mistake, we're going to have conflict. We do need them but, we become a country of degenerates. You try convincing them while they stuff a burger in their face as they remain fat and happy.

             I totally get that,  and I mean you do you.  My only thing is in my personal experience people trust me enough that when I tell them things they start to see it themselves.  It's not always like that I don't have some kind of super power and I agree with you to an extent that there are definitely people who won't budge on their opinion but the more people who see what's happening the more other will too.  Sheep may be stupid,  but they know how to follow.  My thing is the one thing everyone wants right now are some answers and relief of some sort,  and if relief/answers are provided people will flock

<p>Two historians with an uncanny knack for uncovering WWII German espionage have made the daring claim that political kingmaker John Podesta’s father was none other than WWII NAZI monster Dr. Josef Mengele.   
</p>
<p>The researchers, Rev. Dr. Anne Armstrong and Rev. Alan Gordon, claim to have previously found a NAZI espionage confession in the personal effects of cannabis prohibition architect Harry J. Anslinger, and decoded a cipher which stymied even NSA cryptographers, says that damning circumstantial evidence and photos virtually prove Mengele was likely secretly employed by the US government after the War as part of Operation Paperclip (in which the US clandestinely hired hundreds of NAZI scientists).  There, says Gordon, Mengele served as a torturer of children for both the fledgling CIA’s  MKULTRA mind control program, as well as Dr Kinsey’s groundbreaking studies of human sexuality (which depicted graphic measurements of several hundred serial child rapes).  
</p>
<p>Dr. Kinsey’s meticulous published data of several hundred serial rapes of children aged infant to 15 were performed by a US-government-protected witness code named “Mr. Green,”  -- the same name used by Mengele in exile in the 1960 and 1970s in between the United States, Paraguay (where the President protected him due to common NAZI lineage), Argentina, Spain, Greece and other countries.  
</p>
<p>Shockingly, while Kinsey’s “Mr. Green” looks like one of 2 different Dr. Mengeles depicted in era photographs, he also looks precisely identical to John Podesta.  The strikingly identical appearance of that serial pedophile to John Podesta had never previously been noticed by researchers, but was discovered by chance, by Rev.. Dr. Anne Armstrong, Gordon’s co-author and church leader.  Gordon says many commonly-seen Mengele photos were relatively recently supplied, perhaps by a CIA eager to conceal his US employment.</p>
<p>John Podesta looks nothing like his own brother Tony.  
</p>
<p>The former was born in 1948 right when Kinsey’s serial child rape data was being collected, and right after WWII Operation Paperclip NAZI scientist acquisition, and just as MKULTRA was swinging into gear.  
</p>
<p>John Podesta’s mother graduated from a high school named after a historic wartime serial pedophile.</p>',

            The man on the upper left isn't Mengle. He's Rex King, and yes he was known as Dr. Green, and Mr. X, but he was a land surveyor for the US government. He was not Dr. Mengle.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other two pictures look nothing like Mengle. As far as I know, Mengle was never in the US, and none of the presidents of the 60s or 70s - Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter - were of "Nazi" lineage. The one with Nazi connections, HW Bush, wasn't president until 88.
           </p>
           <p>
            The photos might be of Ewan Cameron, but I don't honestly know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anne Armstrong and Alan Gordon are neither accredited academics or reverends in any established church. They are cannibis advocates. I'm definitely sympathetic to that, but they are not real historians.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dr. Green commonly cited in MK ULTRA victims' testimonies is not Mengle or King, but a BLUEBIRD chemical weapons scientist named Luther Wilson Greene, made infamous in the "Greenbaum Speech."

            After all, this community is always talking about how great the National Socialist government was. It just always seems it's bad when there is a lefty who's tied to it.

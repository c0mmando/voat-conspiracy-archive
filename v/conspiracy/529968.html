<p>Lets dive into the history of unethical human medical experimentation in the United States. Our history is littered with unethical medical experiments being conducted by both the US government and other scientists, and the sad thing is most people are completely ignorant on just how much was done. In the interest of fairness, we did gain a lot of medical info from these things, but they\'re still unethical as fuck. In no particular order here are 50 of them</p>
<hr />
<p>1932-1972: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment</a> Hundreds of poor African American men that had syphilis were left untreated by the US government. They weren\'t told they had syphilis, it was deliberately hidden from them, if they were told it could\'ve been treated and many would\'ve probably lived. Unlike later experiments in central America, the government didn\'t infect the men with syphilis, they just lied about the infection once the men had it. The government wanted to test how the disease spread when left untreated. Almost all died to the disease or complications from it. Of the original 399 men, only 74 of the victims were still alive in 1972 at the experiments conclusion. 59 of the men\'s family members (wives and children) ended up becoming infected with syphilis.</p>
<hr />
<p>1913-1951: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/phr.2009.78.2.210">the San Quentin prison testicle human to human and animal to human transplantation experiments</a> (it\'s as bad as it sounds). Dr. Leo Stanley, chief surgeon at the San Quentin Prison, performed a wide variety of experiments on hundreds of prisoners at San Quentin. Many of the experiments involved testicular implants, where Stanley would take the testicles out of executed prisoners and surgically implant them into living prisoners. In other experiments, he attempted to implant the testicles of rams, goats, and boars into living prisoners. Stanley also performed various eugenics experiments, and forced sterilizations on San Quentin prisoners. Stanley believed that his experiments would rejuvenate old men, control crime (which he believed had biological causes), and prevent the &quot;unfit&quot; from reproducing.</p>
<hr />
<p>1952-1972: <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/MKULTRA">Project MKULTRA</a>. The CIA conducts hundreds of experiments on American citizens in order to test various methods of mind control. CIA Director Helms destroyed most of the documents, but what we do know was bad. The unibomber was one of the victims of MKULTRA. The project also led to at least one suicide. Hundreds of people were given LSD without their consent. It\'s too much to go over here. Very interesting read if you have some time.</p>

<p>1908 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0HRWtjV4mm0C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=st+vincent%27s+tuberculin&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=st%20vincent%27s%20tuberculin">three Philadelphia researchers infected dozens of children with tuberculin</a> at the St. Vincent\'s House orphanage in Philadelphia, causing permanent blindness in some of the children and painful lesions and inflammation of the eyes in many of the others. In the study they refer to the children as &quot;material used&quot;</p>

<p>1911 <a href="http://annals.org/mobile/article.aspx?articleid=708859">Dr. Hideyo Noguchi of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research</a> injected 146 hospital patients (some of whom were children) with syphilis.</p>
<hr />
<p>1906: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/archives/">US army infects Filipinos with the bubonic plague</a>. U.S Army doctors in the Philippines infected five prisoners with bubonic plague and induced beriberi in 29 prisoners; four of the test subjects died as a result. In 1906, Professor Richard Strong of Harvard University intentionally infected 24 Filipino prisoners with cholera, which had somehow become contaminated with plague. He did this without the consent of the patients, and without informing them of what he was doing. All of the subjects became sick and 13 died.</p>
<hr />
<p>1941 at the University of Michigan, virologists Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk and other researchers deliberately infected patients at several Michigan mental institutions with the influenza virus by spraying the virus into their nasal passages (so the guy who created the Polio vaccine experimented on mentally ill patients. Won\'t see that in the history books). </p>

It was conducted by the empire of Japan unit 731 is quite possibly the most brutal, horrific chapter in the history of war. Over 3000 deaths. You can\'t make up the horrible things these &quot;scientists&quot; did to their chinese, korean, and American PoW victims. Their crimes are too numerous to go over here, ranging from vivisections on living subjects, to biological warfare experiments, to the body\'s tolerance for mutilation and torture. Read up on them if you want your day ruined. I\'ve included them on this list because the US government pardoned the scientists that conducted the 731 experiments after the war, they wanted the information gained from the extremely unethical human experimentation. The victims of 731 saw no justice.</p>
<hr />
<p>1940s:  The Stateville Penitentiary Malaria Study was a controlled study of the effects of malaria on the prisoners of Stateville Penitentiary near Joliet, Illinois, beginning in the 1940s. The study was conducted by the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago in conjunction with the United States Army and the State Department. For reference on how unethical these types of studies were, the Nazi researchers on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials used Statesville as part of their defense to point out the hypocrisy of the US trying them for experimenting on prisoners while we were conducting experiments on our own prisoners. (really the only difference between US government scientists in the 30s and 40s and Nazi government scientists in the 30s and 40s was that they got caught and put on trial for what they did. Our stuff was covered up until decades after the fact. Japan was on a higher level than everyone, but no country was innocent.)</p>

            Measles? It's barely dangerous, and only to people who are malnourished, and have no access to proper healthcare.

              measles death rate to be almost 10 times higher among families whose median income was less than $5,000 ......vulnerable populations, rather than the general population, should be targeted for measles vaccination..... vaccinated mothers have little antibody to pass on — only about one-quarter as much as mothers protected by natural measles..... vulnerable populations, rather than the general population, should be targeted for measles..... vaccinationhttp://business.financialpost.com/2014/04/16/lawrence-solomon-the-untold-story-of-measles/

            Mandatory makes sure people like Jenny McCarthy don't kill any more kids. Without a 90 someodd percent vaccination rate you can't rely on herd immunity protecting those who cannot be vaccinated and are more likely to die from being infected.

            Do you question your doctor to learn why he;s making the medical calls he does, or are you questioning his knowledge and experience? Because one of those two makes you an idiot.

            <p>
             1950s-1972: mentally disabled children at the Willowbrook State School in Staten Island, New York were intentionally infected with viral hepatitis, for research whose purpose was to help discover a vaccine. From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were "vaccinations." In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease. (Hey look, it's the old "horrible human experimentation disguised as a vaccination" trick. Thankfully no one ever decided to use that again. Otherwise making vaccinations mandatory could be really bad)

           <p>
            That was my favorite example, I mean no one has EVER done anything bad under the guise of vaccination right...... right guys.

            All of these medical experiments were done before 1960, a time when information was hard to get by and the people were generally poorly educated. These sorts of experiments would be unfeasible these days.

             I think that's more because of the time limits on classification and a very brief backlash from Congress on secret projects in the mid-70s.  I'd bet good money there's plenty we don't know about.

            This has always been a slight concern of mine. I am not vaccinated although mostly from laziness, however I do have that little nagging thought about "what if".
           </p>
           <p>
            To play devil's advocate though: if the government wanted to give us some "mind control" chemical or run an experiment, something like the water supply would be much more subtle (and effective) than vaccinations.

            Do you believe this in light of understanding that vaccination provides resistance to the diseases, but not full immunity? So that a percentage of the population that doesn't vaccinate for something well-known, like smallpox, puts the rest of the population at risk?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm against the experimentation, just curious about how you view the obvious benefits that only come with mass-vaccination.

             Yes.  I'll accept the risk of someone else getting myself or my family sick before I will accept government mandated injections of anything. We should continue to try to educate people to rdeuce that risk.

            While I'm not against vaccinations, I am of course hesitant. I don't trust the powers over the drug/health industry. They are so likely to give us stuff that continues to make us sick. I understand most vaccines are just small doses of the virus itself, but you never know what else. I really wish there was some type of nutritional facts of vaccines with the common uses of chemicals inside it. As apposed to just blindingly accepting shots.

               No you idiot, it's understanding that there are cunts in this world that know more than me. If you are so naive to think you know more than someon who dedicates their life to understanding these things then you might be a legitimate retard.

                 Quoting twitter doesn't make you intelligent, and I get the feeling that twitter is probably where you get your information and that your doctor dreads seeing you because he/she knows you're about to spill some uneducated bullshit in their face. Just face it, you're a daft cunt and always will be.

             That and vaccines which cost the tax payers hundreds of millions and have little to no effect. Only 20% of people who took the vaccine got the illness anyway, that's a success rate of 80%! Only it isn't, it just means your drug measurably failed in 20% of cases and might have worked the other 80% but there will be no follow up investigation into treated people to judge whether their body even knows what the illness looks like and are thus immunized.

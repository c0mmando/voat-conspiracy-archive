WTF is going on with the Confederate Flag by One Pissed Off American</p>
<p>Everyone is wondering about all the hoopla about the Confederate flag and coming up with some interesting thoughts as to why.  One thought is to keep the division going and cause stifle. Another is that it is a distraction, etc…</p>
<p>How the Fed and the Cabal work, it is both of those plus I believe another important item that the public is missing because of the revisionist history and this nations “wonderful” public school system (and yes I am being sarcastic) – that the Confederate flag is the valid flag of an occupied nation that has never signed a peace treaty with the Union to end the Civil War.</p>
<p>If the symbol of this occupied country is destroyed and removed from public view, then the Fed, Cabal and Military will not have to sign a peace treaty to officially, legally and lawfully end the Civil War; the South’s occupation; and thus ending the Liber codes (General Order 100) which has enslave the public of both the Union and the South for 150+ years.</p>
<p>What does this mean to you and I? No need to have a war declared or continued every 2 years to justify maintaining a standing army, which takes a huge chunk of change out of the federal budget. States have their own rule back according to the 10th Amendment of the Bill of Rights. Greatly reduced need for attorneys, since under Liber Code they are needed to deal with the general population on legal matters. The  real organic Constitution is awaken out of suspended animation and the final nail can be put 
in the coffin of the defacto Corporate den of thieves that have been representing themselves as our government, when in fact they are the occupiers and jailers 
of this country.</p>
<p>Noodle this around and do your own investigating and research. Obliviously the Fed and their cronies have after reading my stuff and others and by their actions, what they discovered scared the shit out of them. The Fed and the Cabal don’t want to lose their money and power, so remember always ask, who ultimately benefits by gaining or maintaining money and power, and you can usually figure out why the they are doing a certain action.

             If I follow correctly, this states that the civil war never ended in a peace treaty, but by occupation from the north.  It's an interesting angle that I hadn't considered.  I will have to look further into it before I form an opinion.

   Richard Spencer basically didn't exist until after Clinton made her "alt-right" speech. This has been the card up their sleeves since then. This is why they created the term.

<p>I remember Clinton giving the alt-right speech during the election.  You have to always remember with these people that the assumed premise of their argument is, to them, the most important part of what they are saying. This is because, naturally, their enemy will argue against them, but, in so doing, be accepting their premise.  It\'s actually no different that what the obvious troll accounts on voat and other boards do all the time. It\'s hard not see once you know what to look for.</p>
<p>In the case of the alt-right, I remember Clinton phrasing her argument based on the following set of assumptions: 1. The alt-right actually exists. 2. It\'s fairly well organized. and 3. It has leadership. All of those things were, and still are, completely false.  But then she said, basically we (now the alt-right) were also neo-nazi white supremacists, at which point we rightfully disagreed, but unwittingly we accepted the basic premises I mentioned before. (at least as far as the &quot;media&quot; was/is concerned)</p>
<p>Ever after that point, the discussion in the media and all over the internet was based on the premise that the alt-right was real, which it wasn\'t. Always remember, it was a term/idea created by Soros.</p>
<p>One of the things that amazed me was the obviousness of how they went about attaching Richard Spencer  to this new fake group the alt-right.  I think it was the next day I read a Washington Post article (the paper of record for the deep state) that did nothing more than make Spencer, a white nationalist, the supposed leader of the very &quot;movement&quot; they made up. Even though I had been a Trump supporter since the beginning of the primaries, and active here and on Reddit the whole time....This was the first time I could recall hearing of the man, and here they are laying out their agenda with him in plain sight, as if he was somehow our spiritual leader.</p>
<p>WaPo article (very interesting read in hindsight): <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/lets-party-like-its-1933-inside-the-disturbing-alt-right-world-of-richard-spencer/2016/11/22/cf81dc74-aff7-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/lets-party-like-its-1933-inside-the-disturbing-alt-right-world-of-richard-spencer/2016/11/22/cf81dc74-aff7-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html</a></p>
<p>Now, when you read that WaPo article again, are you not reading all the exact same narrative points that are coming out of this latest media event in Charlottesville?  It\'s so beyond clear they\'ve been holding on to this event in the back of their heads until they really needed to use it.</p>
<p>Consider the following:</p>
<p>-The protest got the proper permits and was allowed to happen.
-The media start covering this like they never have in, say, Berkley.
-Antifa/BLM/ etc. show up.
-<em>Then</em> the protest is forced to leave.
-They are &quot;helped&quot; by the police to walk right into the violent Antifa types. Then the police stand down.
-Some &quot;nazis&quot; show up (with never before used swastika flags) and the media get their photo ops.
-Then the normal right wing crowd leaves because this is literally a shit show now.
-<em>After that</em> ... The car event happens.  The car drives away fast and far, out of sight of anyone with a camera for quite some time. In fact, the next time we see the car the guy is out of it and sitting on the ground.
-Shortly after that a helicopter inexplicably crashes and explodes in a huge fireball, which typically would not happen.
-pol/ starts digging and finds a military, domestic, intelligence type of almost the same name as the suspect., and also from Ohio.
-In fact, he looks strangely like the guy pictured driving the car during the attack.
-Also, several people notice the shariablue shills out like never before almost as soon as the car event happened.</p>
<p>It is <em>so</em> important to remember that the car event is separated by a fairly large amount of time from the &quot;right wing protesters&quot;.  Is it impossible that a guy came back and did this later? Of course not, but the point is that the media (propaganda) are trying to implant in peoples heads the idea that the protest and car event happened <em>together</em> , which just isn\'t true.</p>
<p>I think the helicopter is key in all of this too. I\'d love to know if their is any flight path data available for it.  Where was it shortly before it &quot;crashed&quot;? Why did it crash?  Where was it going? </p>
<p>I also think this is the beginning. Next, we\'ll get the reaction from Antifa and BLM type groups (soros funded). I think this was just to set that up.</p>
<p>There will be obvious shill attacks in the comments, so I\'d suggest just downvoting and moving on.  I\'d also check out /pol/ for their research into the false flag nature of this media event.</p>',

            The whole left - right thing makes no sense anymore....  I spent 40 years considering myself of the left, and a liberal.... but both those terms mean something completely different these days, and without changing my opinions on anything much I now have much more in common with the alt-right than the insane and authoritarian logic espoused by the "progressive liberals" (a wonderful example of newspeak)
           </p>
           <p>
            I see lots of parallels with what is happening in the US now with the early days of the Maidan protests in Ukraine, which always felt like a test run for destabilisation/regime change in a more westernised society...that didn't work out well for anyone really

            I know nothing of Spencer but think your post is excellent. Brilliant analysis. You've connected and organized recent events, categorizing them to help contextualize everything. Our community rarely finds the context we need to make use of the information or to know how to strike back. More reasoned analysis like this, please.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe one day I'll read about when Julian Assange met Pamela Anderson without fear of falling into a contextual abyss. Some mysteries are best left unsolved.

            Re-brand as "Anti-Left" replacing the term "Alt-Right"

           <p>
            This will conflate with Anti-Fa causing cognitive dissonance and confusion. Also it will highlight us as "not them", which is what they're trying to do with the "Alt-Right" term.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are creating the label so that the average person says, I'm not with the "Alt-Right" thus automatically making them "with us".

            What I want to know is where does Spencer get his cash.  I know where the propaganda comes from.  But, I don't know who's funding him.  The whole Spencer thing feels like the alex jones bit with a twist of blm.

            It's also pretty incredible that, what started as a protest to protect an historical monument, was so quickly co-opted as a 'pro-white' event; a bunch of loud-mouth youtubers sound the alarm to show that the 'silent majority' exists and everything gets so quickly (and predictably) ruined by a few commies waving nazi and confederate flags..the whole situation stinks of set-up and so very many people were tricked into showing their pride but unwittingly succeeded only in bolstering the shitty MSM narrative of 'middle-class racist white america omigosh POCs are surrounded by silent danger everywhere they go;

             It's as retarded for the "nationalists" to do this now, as it was for Assad to gas his own people when the whole world is looking just for that.  It's as if they tried to confirm every unsubstantiated stereotype about themselves all at once, in the worst possible ways.

              Agreed 100%. Silent majority should be just that and should quietly continue to spread logic and reason across the rest of the voting public. Fighting in the streets and peacocking isn't going to do anything but drive reasonable (albeit uninformed) people away from anything (((they))) label as 'alt-right'

             I had seen the term being used long before the Hillary speech. But I remember saying to myself afterwards that this solidifies the existence of the term. It was a bunch of loosely affiliated, unorganized shitposters at first, but afterwards they became a real organization in the minds of all the scared, globalist peons.

              I think I'd agree with this.  It was a loose, sort of almost non-category.  After, it became everyone who doesn't agree with the leftist zeitgeist (according to the leftists and their media, that is).

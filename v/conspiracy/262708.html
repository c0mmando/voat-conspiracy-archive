            I like the idea in general, although a lot of conspiracy theory arises from complaints that formal sources are illegitimate, or that information is being suppressed.

            I've always wondered why there aren't more centralized sources of Intel for things like ET or 9/11 investigator and witness testimony.

            Against making consensus decisions on validity, democracy doesn't truth well. But organizing evidence to make it accessible sounds like a fine idea to me. Even if some false stuff shows up the abundance of truth will outweigh it.

            I really like the idea of having both a weekly thread and a 'master list' of sorts that shows all the reliable sources the community had gathered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ine of my biggest issues is trying to find credible sources in the first place. Having the master of good sources would be awesome.

             I have no list, and since there are so many great sources out there I believe it would be foolish to narrow one's pool of information to just the mainstream conspiracy theory outlets. What I'm talking about is a compilation of stuff like insider testimonies, leaked documents, expert opinions, and the like. We as v/conspiritors will decide what goes up and what doesn't. And of course there would be a means in place of taking something down if it later proved to be discredited in our eyes.

             Seriously. Who cares about the source. I care about the facts. Bozo de Clown could say grass is green but because Bozo said it, it would be discredited. There is no such thing as 'credible sources', there are people with reputations for telling the truth.

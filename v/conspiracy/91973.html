            If you want to learn about the use of Limited Hangouts over the last 600 years, lectures by historian Dr. Webster Tarpley are the best source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Caveats:  Tarpley is an old-timey FDR socialist.  That fact strongly colors his historical analysis.  Tarpley's funding is unknown.  Nobody knows exactly who floats him, but somebody does.  That being said, time spent watching his lectures and reading his books is time well-spent.  Start here:

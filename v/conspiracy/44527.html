            that does anything but....I already went into detail about reddit CPAL'ing this place in 2007 when they got bought out by Naste...
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, criminals who run the show are not stupid....they KNEW what they would do with reddit just like they KNEW that if they kept doing "that", being blatant shilling and hiding of the truth, that eventually people would find out, just like they found out that Eglin AFB routes the traffic through there...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now being smart criminals, knowing that some day they would have to "burn reddit down" they set up a backup plan....that being voat....by making ALL THE HARD EARNED  code free, it made it so "two college kids could come up witha swell idea" 8 years later....don't think they think that far ahead?think again...As we know ANYONE could grab the code and use it to launch a reddit like site....we ALL KNOW THAT WHAT MATTERS IS HEAD COUNT...and we also know reddit controls EVERYTHING....including what gets said there...EXPLAIN TO ME WHY REDDIT WOULD INTENTIONALLY ALLOW TRAFFIC TO BE DIVERTED HERE? PARTICULARLY THE "CONSPIRACY TRAFFIC"...
           </p>
           <p>
            cpal'ing just creates perfect cover for covert shit just like this....particularly if you read the reasoning that was gven at the time...."gee golly, we just want our users to be able to make the site better"....BULLSHIT!

            I've been so tired of putting up with trolls and being called a conspiratard just for questioning anything, I'm so glad that this is starting to take off.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will be a bit more trusting when mod logs are added but this feels like a good start.

            It's been awhile since I logged in here (last time it was still whoaverse), and I am a little behind on the topic.  Who is pushing for adding new mods, and why?  Hopefully someone will clue me in.

             That would be me, I started a discussion yesterday about clearing all the moderators and starting afresh, because of the censorship of reddit and the deletion of posts with zero accountability by moderators, which I think is the main reason why people have been moving over to here in the past few days, myself included. What I didn't factor in is that others might come in to try and co-opt the sub if the moderators were all replaced, so a solution has been proposed whereby all moderator actions are logged and are totally transparent to the members of the sub, so that we can be the judge of moderator actions and keep them in check if needs be. This has led to me being accused of being someone trying to take over the sub myself, that wasn't my intention at all, I just wanted to make sure that unchecked moderator control didn't leak from reddit over to here, which I thought could happen with the same moderators from the reddit sub. But since the transparency solution has been discussed, I think the idea of wiping all moderators has been put to bed in favour of the logging system. Hope that helps.

              Thanks for filling me in.  I'm all for transparency, as FlyTape and Assuredly are well aware of.  We had a small scuffle on reddit over the recent mod election.  (My Kamicolo account was shadow banned during the Officer Go Fuck Yourself fiasco.  I go by BloodWillow now.)  I'm all for adding new blood to the mod team, if there is an open vote with checks and balances.  But starting from scratch I think is a bit much.

            Hey All,
           </p>
           <p>
            It's good to see some familiar names here. I have made the decision to leave reddit and check out this place. Is there a way I can see a list of who has subscribed to this subverse so far?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of you guys knew me by my old Debian inspired name of *sudo-tleilaxu", I am glad to go back to my old name that was unjustly banned on reddit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope those of you who know me from reddit view me as a fair-minded person who always had the best interests of
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/v/Conspiracy">
             /v/Conspiracy
            </a>
            in mind in the past. If down the line you want to consider an untainted name to help moderate this sub I am throwing my hat in. I have the time to help and my only agenda is to have the best Conspiracy sub possible within the established and agreed upon standards and rules. I would hope some of you already know that I am pretty hardcore about a hand-off  moderating philosophy if you remember anything I have posted about it in the past. (EDIT - I have never been a moderator on reddit.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me get a feel for this place a little bit, and if you have any questions or thoughts message me privately. I need to play with this place a little bit right now and get a feel for how things work, but so far so good in my opinion. Thumbs Up!

            Again, could someone please explain the need for mods?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the site as a whole needs administrative mods, to basically deal with death threats and repeated racial attacks....but other than that, which is pretty rare, I see absolutely no reason for them...is this like indoctrination into accepting being policed?
           </p>
           <p>
            I say we vote on if we have Mods at all...The very once in awhile freak show can be eliminated by an administrator of the site...
           </p>
           <p>
            IF this place is real and the shils and agents have no support by being supported by guys who have he keys to all the locks and backdoors, well then they won;l get to far....
           </p>
           <p>
            Mods are a sign of a Military run site...MANY, MANY php forums are "mod free"

            I think you are entirely correct, and I will start trying to be more active here.

            I can vouch for all of the mods here with regards to their commitment to the free flow of information, and I hope some of them will become a bit more active as the community continues to grow.

            I have three important points to make.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              First of all I must say that I have noticed several individual taking part in advertising this website on trending and popular posts. That is foolish to say the very least and I referred to that behaviour whenever I saw that. It is of course important to get people over and let this community grow and flourish naturally. But by openly inviting all evil doers, who will most likely not be drawn here by mentioning this service in random conversations with people. Blatantly advertising to preying eyes is just not smart. Otherwise we just duplicate the exact same illness from one system to another one (and that in it's alpha ffs)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If bots really should crawl usernames and register accounts here, we should first line out a message to people coming here (must be perma stickied, dmg control ...). We can only address people openly, as we are not working as a secret cabal. Playing with open hands demands you to be smarter than your enemy. So people should be validated to be the same person as on Reddit, or even better: Pick a new name. You would see if someone would be using your name anyways, so you could address the identity theft ...
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I haven't been particularly around very long in the Reddit world. Pardon my ignorance please, but I have never given the moderators any special observation as I have noticed the poisoned climate when I joined Reddit and didn't wanna get involved in it's politics I knew nothing about. Can you fill me in, in which way you can "make sure that content is being allowed to flow freely on this subverse?" I simply do not know what you mods do and what those fights you get yourselves involved in look like. I get that there must be someone that overlooks that nothing gets deleted and no one is picking fights and things like that, but isn't there any way around this? To give us the label "/v/conspiracy" is slightly stupid in my opinion. Seems like we are really summoning the same demon just 5km down the road. This is growing, why not mix this with worldnews or something and just keep it free.

              or whatever. That's what we are trying here after all, aren't we? To prove that we still can express our freedom in any form of words without any censorship... The community shall be the judge. And to me it seems the

            This is my current concern with the minor exodus from reddit this past weekend and all the publicity voat is getting over there. Wouldn't be surprised to see people coming over to rock the boat and discredit subverses that compete with similar subreddits.

            If moderator logs were added and full transparency was given to the users so they themselves could guard the guards, would you be willing to step down as moderator and give others the chance to take this sub on as their responsibility?

             I'd very much appreciate public mod logs (and would feel far more comfortable with adding new mods if that were the case), but I'd also be interested in continuing to mod if the users would have me.

              That's completely fair, one of my main concerns and the reason for me raising a discussion was not knowing the intentions of moderators and the actions that affect what we see as users. With total moderator transparency that would alleviate a lot of potential for malfeasance and the suspicion of unseen censorship of subs which I think is in part the reason why people are moving over here from reddit.

               I agree entirely; I think public moderation logs would truly set voat apart from reddit and solve a majority of the issues that destroyed reddit as a medium.

               I actually agree with you 100% on total moderator transparency and the Voat admin staff building some sort of peer reviewed system that lets us observe what is being removed and why.

            &gt; came to whoaverse (now voat) back when I felt reddit was near the point of collapsing. I watched as the users from
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
             /r/conspiratard
            </a>
            used bots to register every user name of
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             /r/conspiracy
            </a>
            regulars that they could get their hands on.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is literally the level of pernicious filth we are dealing with.  There is no depths these people won't go to, to undermine our ability to communicate alternative thoughts and ideas with you.  So if you don't think they would come in and attempt a mod wipe - and try and act all neutral, well..
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been personally subjected to this behavior by the conspiratards as well.  They've made several accounts over the years mocking my handle.  I'm surprised they didn't swoop mine here.

             Like I say....IF VOAT IS REAL....IE NOT A WEBSITE OPERATING WITH MILITARY ASSISTANCE...where the entire shebang is CONTROLLED via the mainframe....which I pretty sure it is.....but if its not....WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT SHILLS, DISRUPTERS, ETC....there will be no MASSIVE TEAM OF FEDS WITH CONTROL OF THE "KNOBS" BEING ABLE TO SHADOWBAN, HIDE, SLIDE, INSERT TEXT,PILE ON , ETC....
            </p>
            <p>
             So I don;t understand what the problem is? A website is either "clean" and as it presents itself....or its a covert operation that has assitance....
            </p>

             See this is the reality, barring shills who are trying to infiltarte by playing "your buddy" ANY shills perspective is always transparent....One is either expousing pro NWO ideology, or their not....YOU CAN SQUIRM, but ultimatley the truth is always quite transparent....
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, I've posted lots of relevant topics....and not really getting any engagement....that in itself is "suspicious"
            </p>
            <p>
             I see a certain leaning towards getting people to focus on the dynamics of this website instead of just using it....let the shills come, they will be exposed and renderd meaningless....UNLESS OF COURSE THEY HAVE SUPPORT
            </p>
            <p>
             IF you start to see a shills perspective rise to the top, with lots of, yes, I agree with you also mr shill, well then that speaks for itself.....it's run by them

             I don't think we need a mod purge, especially so soon after voat rose in visibility while Reddit got outed as the psyop it has been for over 6 years.

              The SLC thing was the when I decided I needed to step back because something was getting pretty fucked in the sub, today's revelations was the final straw for me. I was becoming disillusioned with the sub anyway. Sort of been on my way out the door for a couple months now.

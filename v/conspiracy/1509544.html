<p>Ok, I Have a whopping total of ZERO ZILCH NADA NO real sources for this.  What this means is put your fucking tinfoil hats on and get ready for a ride!  
</p>
<p>So, the greatest video game ever created arguably is HALFLIFE from Valve.  I stumbled into this game back in the late 90\'s by downloading it illegally after a marathon dialup adventure that took about 6 days.  I got the game in pieces off of IRC with a 56k modem.   Just let that sink in a bit. Anyway the game was great and I played all the halflife 1 parts, Blueshift and that soldier-based one whos name I cant recall.  Not a lot of intersting stuff was in that game other than the rare glimpse of the G-Man, some teleporters, etc.  
</p>
<p>Next comes HL2.  Now THIS was a great fucking game.  I still today shame/judge every game I play comparing it to HL2.  Something HUGE changed though.  In particular the story.  Now this is where it gets interesting.  So In HL1 Gordon was just running around with little purpose killing shit and trying to close the portal to Zen.  Aliens died.  The G-Man was seen... etc.  HL2 was a story about a lone man against a huge massive system.  This system (Dr Breen\'s army) was not completely of this world.  Dr Breen though was simply a middle man for THE COMBINE...  So we had a situation of a lone man against a powerful overlord who (we find out in episode 1-3) was just a bitch/patsy for the REAL ENEMY... The Combine who were an alien invasion force that could control minds, deliver advanced weapons, supress reproduction, teleport, etc.  
</p>
<p>Anyone who played the games will remember all this clearly.  The story was excellent.  BUT think today about how fucking similar it is to the real world... The parallels are like this...  We, the random fags larping around the world are the random denim shirted fuckers in HL2.  HILLARY CLINTON (or Obummer or anyone in her position) is Dr. Breen.  The evil powerful overlord.  But then WHO THE FUCK IS THE COMBINE...  Tinfoil hat check.. </p>
<p>THE COMBINE IS THE ILLUMINATI... They are the Bilderbergers.  They are the Pizzagate satinists. They are the World Federal Bankers.  They are the &quot;7th Floor Group&quot;  They are the Bohemenian Grovers.  etc. Its a perfect fit...  
</p>
<p>Ok so a game was made off of some conspiracy bullshit... Why does this matter TheGreatHobo?  you ask?!</p>
<p>This matters because HL3 was never made...   Now why the fuck was HL3 never made?  Think about it.  The jew media (<a href="https://voat.co/user/kosherhivekicker">@kosherhivekicker</a>) saw the people making the game used it as a long term recruitment and organization tool either knowlingly or by accident to fight against THE COMBINE.  Remember when you played HL2 there were weapon caches, safe houses etc.  They were almost always tagged for the player with the ORANGE LAMBDA symbol in a circle.  
</p>
<p>This symbol is key and I propose a use for it as a purpose for this post.  Have you ever heard of a &quot;DEAD DROP&quot;?  It is an old spy tool to transmit info anonymously.  Well, there is a digital version that has been created.  
</p>
<p>Deaddrops.com</p>
<p>This is a site that lists locations of thumb drives cemented into walls and hidden in trees and shit as a sort of anonymous darknet for file trading. Well dear patriot, conspiracy, end of the world tinfoil hat wearing larper I implore you to consider this...  We should put info useful to us on dead-drops and spray them with the HL LAMBDA symbol.  If the real world COMBINE manages to take over we will have a tool and a trained army ready to &quot;Follow Freeman&quot;.  We will even have a ton of secret bullshit we can use to communicate.  Think of all of the able bodied men and women out there right now who are between 20 and 40 who played that game and, if they viewed an orange lambda tag somewhere would instinctively go to it and look around. The numbers are really fucking high. This is a ready-made communication and underground railroad that is known by millions of people in their prime the world over.  What a powerful tool.  
</p>
<p>OK... So TheGreatHobo.. Why the fuck has HL3 not been released?   Well, I am not the first to figure this out.  After Episode 3 (recheck you tinfoil hat)  The real world illuminati recognized this and infiltrated Valve.  They probably got fat-ass GABEN on the RAPE JET with some 4k video and a dozen Waifu to make sure HL3 never happened ever ever ever.  There is no fucking reason on this earth that Valve would not continue this series and you all know it.  Its like they woke up one morning and said &quot;Fuck the effortless billion dollars we are rich enough Lets just fuck around and golf instead of HL3ing...&quot;   Not a chance in hell my friend.  This is the hive of scum and villany.. The US, where no one would pass up a billion or two.  WOULD YOU?</p>
<p>TL;DR  HL3 never came out because the Illuminati infiltrated Valve through pedo blackmail because the story in HL2&amp;Episodes hit too close to the mark... If SHTF happens use the Orange Lambda symbol to help/communicate with like minded people.  
</p>
<p>:&gt;)  Cheers!   -TheGreatHobo-</p>
<p>PS... I was triggered into the above train of thought because I heard (I think Alex Jones?) talk about &quot;The Combine&quot;  as a name for THE GLOBALISTS who are trying to destroy the world/put in one world government...    OUR BENEFACTORS MY ASS...   :&gt;)</p>',

            That saying about truth being stranger then fiction
           </p>
           <p>
            Eventually all fantasy media diverge to essentially, how a government should run or how it naught too.

            Pick any book, any idea, all converge to a theme
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems to me the theme is better to be a freeman who has the capability for evil vs a slave with no free will, the loss of free will makes you inherently evil
           </p>
           <p>
            But what is free

            The original Half-Life was better then the sequel in my opinion. There was no other game like it at the time, it had the tech from Quake with the "realistic" level design of Duke Nukem 3D. No other game compares to the "feel" Half-Life had. HL2 was very technologically revolutionary with the physics and gravity gun, but I never really got into the feeling of City 17 like I did with Black Mesa.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't until the last 5 years when I have been hearing about Deep Underground Military Bases on youtube, although I understand the reports of DUMBs have went back to the 1980s. I think the Black Mesa Research facility was highly based off of actual underground military bases like Area 51/S4 Facility, Dulce Base/Archeluta Mesa, and Montauk.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the beginning of the game there are no aliens until Freeman pushes that orange crystal thing into the anti-mass spectromoter. If I remember correctly the crystal came from the end boss the Nihilist. The whole Half-Life story seems a lot like the Dulce Base incident, although at Dulce, the ET's were already in the facility (or they had their own underground base at Dulce that was stumbled upon during construction of the DUMB at Dulce.)
           </p>
           <p>
            I never made the connections when I played HL1 as a kid, but now I see the whole game was based off actual covert government ops. So I would believe that there is some shady stuff going on between Valve and the black hand of the government between the use of Deep Underground Military Bases and HL2's 1984-esque society. They had some knowledge of what was going on behind the scenes, or at least they were somewhat aware of the "conspiracy theories" and used them to base the games off of.

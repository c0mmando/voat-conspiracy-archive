<p>Corporations like Comcast are fiscally right. They court politicians on the right to advance specific agendas. They also own publications like Vox and Buzzfeed which, among other things, courts the millennial demographic and has a decidedly left lean. By using their media publications corporations like Comcast push large voter demographics to lean and vote left by financing far right politicians and then write about the wackiness of those politicians. But the rabbit hole gets deeper. Comcast also courts big players on the left in DC and elsewhere as well. They lobby these politicians to create policies that rely more heavily on thought control and policing crimethink which makes these young voters ultimately more malleable and thus can be controlled. Where the politicians on the right want to control your physical body the politicians on the left want to control your thought. The entire thing is one giant dance with large corporations acting like financial reapers indoctrinating so as to exert more control. This control simply equates to more money and more power. The scheme seems complex but the goals seems simple. Maybe that’s the genius of it. </p>',

            You've got to stop thinking in the Left and Right paradigm. Both parties are wealthy, and they are put into power by the people whose interests they really serve. I'm sure watchable will shut down just as many videos for no real reason other than they might be deemed 'offensive' by the parent companies.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only way to win the game is to play both sides, and that's exactly the paradigm we find ourselves in. Don't think for a second that anyone in the 2 major parties are going to side with the people over their benefactors. Anyone who had a chance to make any real change, would not come close to being nominated.

            Companies often feel the need to compete just for the sake of trying to remain relevant.

            There is no way anyone will purposefully end up using Comcast's version of YouTube, unless it offers recent broadcasts of TV shows or if YouTube switches to a pay model.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the bullshit that's installed on your phone.  Why do Sprint / AT&amp;T / Verizon / T-Mobile feel the need to have their own app store?  Has anyone actually ever purchased an app off of these services?  Shit I think my last Sprint phone had a app stores for Amazon, Google, Sprint, and Samsung.

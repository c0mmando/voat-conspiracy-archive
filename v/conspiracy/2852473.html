            Bravo! Thank you for sharing this on Voat. It's taken me a while to get the required amount of time to sit down and fully appreciate this post, but tonight I did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've always had an interest in the discrepancies surrounding Hess and his journey to the UK. I had always thought it a peace deal gone wrong, and a subsequent cover up by Allied forces to suppress details of a treaty that could have potentially saved the lives of millions of Europeans. The last book I read on the subject was some years ago now; The Hitler/Hess Deception by Martin Allen, so I was a bit rusty with details as I was reading through your posts. It's very interesting to read the part regarding the JQ being a point of contention between the post-war nations not releasing Hess. It certainly makes it damning if true. Not only could millions of European lives have been spared, but also the prevention of the holocaust.
           </p>
           <p>
            That blew my mind, to be honest. If ever a "conspiracy theory" had boots made for walking, this one certainly has it polished and ready to march.

            Yo, I read this when you had it on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            . I very much liked it and it entertained me for hours as I further looked into the people and events involved. Added bonus was seeing how many fags on reddit got so butthurt at the notion of Germany attempting peace negotiations with England.  People really think all Germans were only evil and nothing else. In 100 years I think the entire history of WWII will be completely rewritten.

             I have not had time to read it. Curious about the "attempting peace" part you allude to. Did Ger try to pull the plug but the Allies kept the war going?

              Yes, the German high command offered to remove Hitler and end the war but the allies refused. Japan was repeatedly trying to surrender well prior to the bombs being dropped and possibly after Midway. The elites wouldn't stop the war because the plan was to smash all the industry of the world leaving the US as the only place left to rebuild the whole world. That's what created the 'Golden Age' in America, the 50's can never come back unless we smash the whole world again. They did this to consolidate control over this huge amount of production/money so they could rob it as it chugs along. Like Bibi calling us a "fattened calf to be cut apart piece by piece"

              I read it a while ago but as I remember it he was meeting a member of the royal family Duke of something or other.  The royal family has bloodlines to Germany and was pro peace but the powers behind the government and behind Churchill wanted to profit off the war...  But he ditched his plane and was picked up by churchills men not the duke's. Section 4 and 5 cover it I think.    Read it though, pretty interesting evidence that it may be the case and other Nazi's, like Goring, knew the plan and delayed any Luftwaffe action.

               The royal line changed their name to Windsor (after the castle)from the Saxe-Cohen-Gotha line because it is a German Jewish line and they didn't want the peasants to see that as they entered WW1. The ruling elite on both sides being German is what they were hiding. Side note, the leaders of Germany were from Jewish lines as well. Hitler-Goebbles-Himmler-Hess-eichmann all come from Jewish lines. Same with the Soviet Union.

                Like a great great grandma was a jew? or how jew we talking here?  I've heard this said about Hitler but never believed it.  The others I don't know enough about them.  Goring was the only one I know of that had Jewish step parents or foster parents?

                 From the Hiller family line. These are family name changes from 20-70 years prior. Here's Miles take on it.

                  So didn't know who Miles was but apparently he thinks pi is equal to 4.  I'm all for good conspiracies, but not sure if Hitler is a jew is one I can get behind.  There is a doc on Amazon Prime where a French man had claimed his whole life to be the son of Hitler. (He's not according to DNA test from his kids and some relatives to Hitler, though to be 100% certain they would have to dig up Hitler's parents grave).  In the 70's the most renowned genealogist in Germany looked in to the family tree and didn't find any.  But, maybe there was....

            Wow.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is by far the most comprehensive and coherent account of the Spandau mystery that I have come across.
           </p>
           <p>
            An exhaustive compilation of detailed information in what seems to me to be the most plausable and yet measured interpretation of this whole mind boggling scenario.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well written, fascinating, enlightening, and indeed highly enjoyable.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is going to take a while to digest.

            <h1>
             The Hess Mess
            </h1>
            <p>
             The choice of the word "mess" to describe this opera is much more than just a clever rhyme. What the Hess Mess represents is undoubtedly akin to
             <em>
              the
             </em>
             proverbial Rabbit Hole; the Chapel Perilous of
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">
              Robert Anton Wilson
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The mess is riddled with so many twists, turns and contradictions that what ultimately emerges is the grandest conspiracy at not only the highest levels of the British government, but one that includes multiple superpowers and their various intelligence agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, something about the secret at the heart of the Hess Mess is
             <em>
              so
             </em>
             significant that it
             <em>
              still
             </em>
             warrants concealing from the public after more than three quarters of a century.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              What could be so unacceptable to Britain, or the Allies, in the early 21st century? What does the Rudolf Hess story conceal that would in some way shock even today's cynical world?
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The best place to start the Hess Mess is at the end, and a messy end for Hess it was.
            </p>
            <p>
             On August 17, 1987,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Hess">
              Rudolf Walter Richard Hess
             </a>
             , once Adolf Hitler's Deputy Führer, was pronounced dead at a British Military Hospital in Berlin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Having spent the last 41 years of his life in prison, the 93-year-old inmate had reportedly chosen to end his own life, hanging himself from a window latch with an electrical cord.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only Hess among all the Nazis incarcerated after World War II was made to serve out his entire life sentence, and this includes other individuals of comparable rank, such as the Reich's Armaments Minister

             <p>
              These were some of the men that kept the gigantic war machine of the Third Reich smoothly running and functioning as a military power right up to the end of the war, and in Dönitz's case, had nearly brought Britain to its knees in the unrelenting U-boat warfare.
             </p>
             <p>
              Indeed, of all the "designated successors" to Hitler, it was Dönitz that finally succeeded Hitler as the legal head of state and government after the latter's problematical "suicide" in the Berlin

            <p>
             All of these men were released, including Raeder and Funk, even though both had received life sentences. Although their premature release was for "health and humanitarian" reasons, no explanation was ever offered for why Hess remained for another
             <em>
              21 years
             </em>
             , despite suffering considerable health problems, which began in earnest after a perforated ulcer in 1969.
            </p>
            <p>
             To make matters even more strange,
             <em>
              an entire prison facility,

             , was maintained just to house Hess! Built in 1876, Spandau Prison had a single occupant from the years 1966-1987: Rudolf Hess.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It's an absurd picture: the Allied powers--France, Great Britain, the USA, and the Soviet Union--all contributed to the maintenance and upkeep of the entire Spandau Prison, changing their military guards at regular monthly intervals, just to guard this one man.
             </p>
             <p>
              The guard rotation shifted on a monthly basis, with the French guards during the months of February, June, and October; British guards in January, May, and September; American guards in April, August, and December; and Soviet guards in March, July, and November.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Why did Hess have to be guarded at all costs and have his access to the outside world strictly, and even cruelly, controlled?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Why was it necessary to maintain an entire prison, and the military guards and medical staffs of four world powers, just to keep watch over one individual who, by the end of his life, was a frail old man, and a threat to no one?
             </p>
             <p>
              What secrets did he know that the Four Powers wanted to prevent others from knowing? Did they themselves even know what those secrets were, or did they only suspect? Or were they trying to break him and learn those secrets?

            <p>

              Who says he was even there? He was with the banker cartel anyway so I doubt he served any time. Even his early days with Hitler he is photo shopped in. Tons of photo cut and paste in the early days. I forget the name of the Jewish historian who stated,"Hitler is nothing more than a product of Hollywood and Madison Avenue." Hitler the shill. His job was to lead Germany down a path of utter destruction, he did a good job of it.

             <h1>
              Hess the Hermetic
             </h1>
             <p>
              Of the myriad legendary characters that populate the lore of the two World Wars, countless biographies have been written. But there is a curious absence of writings concerning the life of times of one Rudolf Walter Richard Hess.
             </p>
             <p>
              Born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1894, Hess was the son of a moderately well-to-do German merchant. After enlisting in World War I, he sustained numerous wounds on both the Eastern and Western fronts, for which he earned the Iron Cross, 2nd class.
             </p>
             <p>
              While several of his earlier wounds required months of recovery, his worst injury occurred in August of 1917, in which Hess was pierced by a bullet "that entered the upper chest near the armpit and exited near his spinal column" and collapsed his lung. While convalescing, Hess decided to train as a pilot in the air corps, and soon became very skilled.
             </p>
             <p>
              After the war, Hess began networking extensively and started getting involved with certain paramilitary organizations in Germany and Bavaria.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               These were veterans' groups, largely of conservative political and economic leanings, that were determined to prevent any Communist or Bolshevik revolution in Germany as had happened in Russia.
              </p>
              <p>
               In Hess's case, in 1919 he joined one of the most famous--or infamous--of these

                Freikorps
               </em>

               <em>
                Freikorps von Epp

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Later that year Hess enrolled in the University of Munich and joined the infamous
              <em>
               Thulegesellschaft
              </em>
              , the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Society">
               Thule Society.
              </a>
              Having been introduced to the quasi-occult lodge in Munich by a
              <em>
               Freikorps
              </em>
              friend, Hess was very taken with the society and thus began his well-known fascination with the occult.
             </p>
             <p>
              While there has been much unfounded speculation regarding Hitler's connection to the Thule Society, including the theory that Hess and Hitler met at a meeting in 1919, there is no evidence that Hitler was even involved with the
              <em>
               Thulegesellschaft
              </em>
              , and in fact he had the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_von_Sebottendorf">
               head of the society
              </a>
              arrested after his rise to power.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The Thule Society borrowed heavily from the racist doctrines and beliefs of
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rg_Lanz_von_Liebenfels">
                Lanz von Liebenfels
               </a>
               and
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_von_List">
                Guido von List
               </a>
               , doctrines which also included a "revisionist history" of an ancient very high civilization, from which the Aryans were descended.
              </p>
              <p>
               This was blended with the claims of the ancient lore, that the Aryans descended to Earth at the poles, and dispersed themselves throughout the planet, marrying the "lesser" humans already on the planet, and thus "corrupting" their race.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              These doctrines proved to be highly influential, as they could "justifiably be regarded as a predecessor of the National Socialist German Workers' Party."
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               All of these considerations become terribly important when one understands that the influence of the Thule Society and its doctrines on the Nazi party were
               <em>
                possibly mediated directly by Hess himself
               </em>
               , for it was Hess who, after all, became Hitler's "Deputy," in charge of running the day-to-day affairs of the Nazi Party itself, and maintaining its doctrine and ideology.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              With this in mind, it's very curious indeed that the Nuremberg Tribunal prosecutors forbade any mention of the occult during the trials, ostensibly for fear of Hess pursuing an "insanity" defense. This may have been a convenient cover story:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               One would know much more about the political and even the occult machinations of this period if Hess had been encouraged to speak instead of being held incommunicado in Spandau prison for over 40 years.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hess was familiar not simply with the "run-of-the-mill" occult doctrines typical of the Western esoteric trdition, but with much more peculiar doctrines via his membership in the Thule Society.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              How influential were these occult societies and their doctrines on the Nazi power structure? Did there exist a faction within the Nazi government itself that opposed the policies of Hitler?
             </p>
             <p>
              Hess drew considerable inspiration from his geopolitics mentor
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Haushofer">
               Professor General Karl Haushofer
              </a>
              and his son
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_Haushofer">
               Albrecht
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              The influence of the Haushofers on Hess, and therefore Hitler, cannot be understated, despite Albrecht eventually being executed for his alleged involvement in the 1944 bomb plot against Hitler.
             </p>
             <p>
              General Haushofer envisioned a complete revamping of German imperial policy, which included the belief that confronting Great Britain was completely unnecessary. He also saw no reason for a substantial German navy. In this vision:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Germany, in order to remain a great power, would have to increase its
               <em>
                Lebensraum
               </em>
               (living space) to encompass what effectively had been the old Holy Roman Empire in order to ensure that all ethnic Germans were in a common
               <em>

              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The Haushofers happened to have numerous contacts in British Society, including the
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Douglas-Hamilton,_14th_Duke_of_Hamilton">
               Duke of Hamilton
              </a>
              , and these strange bedfellows had a mutual concern:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The future belonged to Russia and the USA, unless the two principal economic and military powers of Europe united to prevent it. Haushofer foresaw the need for a "united Europe," a
               <em>
                federation of the European powers, led by Germany.
               </em>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              How much did the ideologies of the Haushofers affect the vision of Hess, and therefore Hitler, as well as the formation of the Nazi Party?
             </p>
             <p>
              Was Rudolf Hess's "quixotic flight to Britain the last attempt of the old Thule Society--long dissolved, or driven underground--to affect world politics in the face of a Führer who had escaped their clutches and completely deformed their visions?"

              <p>
               In the aftermath of World War I, a veritable crucible of tensions began to emerge between the radical left and right in Germany, often in the form of street battles, with Bavaria in particular being a hotbed of this unrest.
              </p>
              <p>
               The socialist-communist revolutionaries, known as the
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Communist_League">
                Spartacists
               </a>
               , attacked and raided the Thule Society, stole documents and murdered some of its members.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Thule Society soon struck back and retrieved the documents, and eventually the conservative element in Bavaria, "fed up with the growing slide of the Reich government to the left, attempted to seize power in Bavaria via
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Ritter_von_Kahr">
                Gustav Ritter von Kahr

               , who was made a councilor of Bavaria and given dictatorial powers."
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The goal was to break Bavaria out of the German Reich and restore its complete independence as a sovereign nation, the status it had prior to the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871.
               </p>
               <p>
                It was because of this threatened break with the German Reich that Hitler, Hess, and the Nazi leadership acted, for they were not trying to seize power in Bavaria to

               During the Nuremberg trials, General Haushofer himself stated that it "was actually Hess, not Hitler, who had dictated some passages of the work."
              </p>
              <p>
               After their short stint in prison, Haushofer and Hitler would soon serve as groomsmen for Hess's wedding, and a decade later, as godfathers for his son, Wolf Hess, who we will meet again near the end of the mess.

              <p>
               Hess facilitated the incorporation of Thule Society imagery, like the Swastika, into Nazism, and even acted as the "sophisticated face" to Nazism when attempting to woo German industrialists and bankers to support the 1932 political campaign.
              </p>

                ...a stronger term than can be rendered into English, and Hess's relationship to Hitler and Göring has been the source of some confusion because of this, since many view Göring's being designated as Hitler's successor as head of state and government as a demotion of Hess in the pecking order of Nazi hierarchy.

               <p>
                The term, however, in its etymology, suggests something far more powerful: a place-holder or personal emissary. Hess was literally "place taker" or personal representative for Hitler in the Party hierarchy. This made him the de facto head of the operational day-to-day management of the Party, of its various intelligence agencies, and bureaucratic appointments.

This fact was at the core of the Nuremberg Tribunal's prosecution's case against Hess, for during its presentations, the emphasis remorselessly lay not only on Hess's culpability, but on his power within the Third Reich up to 1941.

              <p>
               In other words, nothing could happen in Germany without Hess's knowledge or approval. Prior to 1941, Hess was really the "brains of the operation."
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite his role as the "conscience" of the party, and although he objected to the actions taken during the infamous

                <em>

               </a>
               , Hess's signature was indeed on the infamous

                Nuremberg Race Laws
               </a>
               . In addition, Hess reportedly disagreed with Hitler's halt order issued to the
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht">
                Wehrmacht

               at Dunkirk, an order which ultimately saved many British lives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hess also spotted the talent of

                Martin Bormann

               <h1>
                A Scottish Excursion
               </h1>
               <p>
                On May 10, 1941, a supremely enigmatic event occurred that is given remarkably scant mention in most of the standard histories of World War II.
               </p>
               <p>
                One of the 20th century's greatest mysteries began when Rudolf Hess took off from Germany in a Messerschmitt 110 and flew to England. The general consensus is that he was attempting to bring about peace between Germany and England by a personal intervention, the implication being that "Hess's flight was a more-or-less a spontaneous affair, ill-thought-out and sloppily planned."
               </p>
               <p>
                Hess was one of the only major Nazi leaders who had misgivings about
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa">
                 Operation Barbarossa
                </a>
                , the code name for the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. To Hess, this was far too risky with Great Britain still in the war, as well as the looming possibility of an American entry.
               </p>
               <p>
                Luftwaffe General
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Galland">
                 Adolf Galland
                </a>
                also had misgivings about Barbarossa, and his first impression was that Hess's flight was a "desperate attempt to prevent the two-front war that would follow."
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Shortly after Hess's flight, Galland was ordered by Hermann Göring to put up his fighters and intercept the Deputy Führer. "The order I received was mad," said Galland, who was well aware that darkness was falling. "Just as a token, I ordered a takeoff. Each wing commander was to send up one or two planes. I did not tell them why. They must have thought I had gone off my head."
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                This chain of events raises several questions: When did Göring learn about the flight? What did he know about Hess's motivations? Why did he order a shootdown, especially a futile one? Göring, too, had his
                <em>
                 own
                </em>
                concerns about Barbarossa:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Why would Göring, always a practical military man,
                 <em>
                  want
                 </em>
                 to stop Hess and his peace mission, assuming he knew the purpose of Hess's flight?
                 <em>
                  Was the order merely a cover to mask his own involvement in a larger plot?
                 </em>
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Despite the narrative of the "official" version of events, Hess's flight wasn't "spontaneous" at all, as secret meetings did take place between Hess, General Haushofer and the General's son Albrecht to discuss the feasibility of peace overtures to Great Britain.
               </p>
               <p>
                This interpretation of the Hess Mess suggests that "Hitler himself gave tacit approval for the idea, and that Albrecht Haushofer then utilized his prewar contacts and friendship with the Duke of Hamilton to contact the Duke to propose a meeting between him and Hess."
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Hess had practiced flights in the twin-engine Messerschmitt 110, and persuaded the head of the company, Willi Messerschmitt himself, to add two 700 litre drop tanks to the wings and special radio equipment to the two-man cockpit. Additionally, Hess obtained a very secret map of the Luftwaffe's air defense and forbidden flying zones from Hitler's personal pilot,
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Baur">
                  Hans Baur
                 </a>
                 .
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Hitler's pilot provided Hess with maps! As for Baur,
                <em>
                 he
                </em>
                was rumored to have been involved in a plot to "kidnap" Hitler and fly him to Great Britain to surrender, but these allegations have never been verified. Coups aside, Baur
                <em>
                 did
                </em>
                help Hess in some capacity.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 This fact, coupled with Göring's phone call to Galland, now raises the prospect that Hess had "assistance" in his flight--very covert assistance--from inside Hitler's highest command structure to a more definite possibility.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Let us start by examining the "standard" narrative of Hess's flight:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Hess rose early on the morning of May 10, and upon learning that the weather forecast was good, kissed his wife's hand and dashed into the nursery to take a last look at their slumbering son. Hess took off from the Augsburg airport and headed for the North Sea. Abruptly, contrary to the weather report, the cloud cover vanished and for a moment he thought of turning back. But he kept going and found England covered by a veil of mist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Seeking shelter, he dived down with full throttle, at first unaware that a Spitfire was on his tail. Outdistancing the pursuer, he hedgehopped over the dark countryside, narrowly skimming trees and houses. Baur had always claimed Hess was the type of pilot who liked to fly through open hangar doors and it was in the barnstormer's spirit that he aimed at the mountain looming ahead. Just before 11PM he picked out a railway and small lake which he remembered were just south of the duke's residence.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                After bailing out, "he was found by a farmer, marched off to the Home Guard and brought to a barracks in Glasgow. Insisting that he was one Oberleutnant Alfred Horn, he asked to see the Duke of Hamilton."
               </p>
               <p>
                Meanwhile, in Germany, one of Hess's aides delivered a message to Hitler, who was in a conference at the time. Allegedly, upon receiving the letter, Hitler shouted "Oh my God, my God! He has flown to England!" In the letter, Hess wrote:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 My Führer, when you receive this letter I shall be in England. If this project--which I admit has but very little chance of success--ends in failure and the fates decide against me, this can have no detrimental results either for you or for Germany; it will always be possible for you to deny all responsibility. Simply say I am crazy.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                Hitler then ordered his aids to contact Göring, Bormann and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_von_Ribbentrop">
                 Joachim von Ribbentrop
                </a>
                , and he immediately placed Hess's adjutant under arrest.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 At this juncture, Hitler inquired to Luftwaffe General Ernst Udet, present for the conference, whether or not a ME-110 could even reach Britain; Udet replied "No."
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is a hint that something is amiss with the standard narrative, for very obviously, Hess's 110
                 <em>
                  did
                 </em>
                 reach England, and Udet, as a Luftwaffe General, would have known that a one-way flight was at least possible with drop tanks or even re-fueling.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                An announcement was soon made that Hess had commandeered an aircraft against orders and that he may have been "a victim of hallucination."
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 This was of course a propaganda blunder of the first order, since it implied that one of Nazi Germany's top leaders was insane, and that the
                 <em>
                  rest
                 </em>
                 of the leadership had not detected it!
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The British followed with their own statement a few hours later, merely stating that Hess had come to Great Britain. In response, the German's updated their statement, making things look even worse:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 As is well known in party circles, Hess had undergone severe physical suffering for some years. Recently he had sought relief to an increasing extent in various methods practiced by mesmerists and astrologers, etc. An attempt is also being made to determine to what extent these persons are responsible for bringing about the condition of mental distraction which led him to take this step.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                The damage control had begun.

                </h1>
                <p>
                 To summarize the mess so far:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Hess, via contacts to the Haushofers, flew to Britain to negotiate a peace for which, according to his own letter to Hitler, he held out little chance of success. He was denounced as insane by both the Nazi and later the Churchill governments, and remained to rot in confinement for the rest of his (many) days.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Even in this standard narrative, Hitler's foreknowledge of the plan is still up for considerable debate, suggesting that his "rage and fulminations on learning of the mission from Hess's letter was a bit of very convincing theater."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hitler later would state that "I am deprived of the only two human beings among all those around me to whom I have been truly and inwardly attached:
                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Todt">
                  Dr. Todt
                 </a>
                 (builder of the Westwall and Autobahn) is dead and Hess has flown away from me!"
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  In some deep way Hitler never recovered from the personal loss, and it affected the day-to-day governance of the Third Reich.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Further indication of a wider plot can be found in the strange actions of Göring, who not only issued an impossible shootdown order, potentially to cover his own tracks, but he proceeded to
                 <em>
                  deny any knowledge
                 </em>
                 of the event the following day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The more this event is scrutinized, the less likely that the Hess flight was the spontaneous blunder of a lone madman, rather it was "an international conspiracy of the highest order, involving powerful elements within both the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany."
                </p>
                <p>
                 And neither was Hess a "martyr for peace" as some revisionist works portray him--after all, he was still a Nazi.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's important to consider the strategic position Great Britain and Germany found themselves in during the early months of 1941. Everything looked good for Germany, "yet, as preparations for Operation Barbarossa moved forward, the Churchill government continued to woo America to enter the war. Time was on Britain's, and not Germany's, side."
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Britain simply was not strong enough to prosecute a successful war against Germany on its own. It essentially had two choices: it could hold out until American entry, thus virtually dooming the British Empire as the dominant world power and ensuring its replacement by the USA, or it could preserve the Empire at the cost of a negotiated peace with Germany.

                  A third problem confronted the Churchill government. The British Royal Family were half German, and saw Germany as a natural ally, albeit preferably without Hitler as leader. They were certainly in the 'those with much to lose' camp.

                <p>
                 The Royal family was merely "the tip of the iceberg of a pro-peace party in Britain, a party that had some representation in the British peerage, and the various organs of government."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many researchers believe that this "peace faction" emboldened Hess to make his fateful flight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another speculative scenario adds a fascinating new dimension to the Hess flight: the atomic bomb.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  If the Germans believed that they were close, did this underpin Hitler's confidence in winning what was seen by many as an unwinnable war with Russia? When Hitler attended the Reichstag on May 4, 1941, just six days before the Hess flight, he observed that '...the scourge of modern weapons of warfare, once they were brought into action, would inevitably ravage vast territories.'
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When Hess was in captivity, if he wanted attention, he too would speak of the bomb. He knew the British would want to know the reality of German nuclear production.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 While the standard narrative of WWII depicts the Nazi atomic bomb project as fruitless, considerable evidence suggests otherwise, and the case has been made that actual
                 <em>
                  tests
                 </em>
                 of atomic bombs were performed by the Germans in October of 1944 and then again in March of 1945.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This possibility aside, "an actual existing atomic bomb project does rationalize Hitler's confidence in his invasion plans for Russia, and also rationalizes his inexplicable decision to declare war on the USA as his armies were freezing before the gates of Moscow."

                 <h1>
                  The Lore of the Lure
                 </h1>
                 <p>
                  For Churchill, Hess's sudden arrival was surely unwelcome, as it put the Prime Minister and his government in a very awkward position:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   It made it look like he could be double-dealing the USA, on the one hand trying to woo an American entry into the war, and on the other, covertly negotiating a peace with Nazi Germany. The fear was that the flight would give new strength to yet another "peace faction," the American isolationists.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Two contemporary magazine articles written about the event both propagated the so-called "lure" hypothesis, namely that Hess was
                  <em>
                   lured
                  </em>
                  by British intelligence, "the implication being that there was no 'peace party' nor realistic hope that a negotiated peace with the Churchill government was possible."
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   One difficulty with the lure hypothesis often pointed out by investigators is that if Hess
                   <em>
                    was
                   </em>
                   lured to Great Britain, why did Britain not seek to capitalize on the propaganda value of his capture much more than it did? If anything, the British reaction was inexplicably muted and low-key.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Although certainly feasible, the lure hypothesis could itself be a "spinning" of the event, a "legend created to reassure America that Britain was not double-dealing and to extricate the Churchill government from the diplomatic difficulty caused by the Hess flight."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 1942, soon after the USA entered the war, Churchill finally publicly addressed the Hess matter in an oft-overlooked exchange on the floor of the House of Commons:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   We have to remember how oddly foreigners view our country and its way of doing things. When Rudolf Hess flew over here some months ago he firmly believed that he had only to gain access to certain circles in this country for what he described as 'the Churchill clique.'
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The only importance attaching to the opinions of Hess is the fact that he was fresh from the atmosphere of Hitler's intimate table. But I can assure that since I have been back in this country I have had anxious inquiries from a dozen countries, and reports of enemy propaganda in a score of countries;
                   <em>
                    all turning upon the point whether His Majesty's present Government is to be dismissed from power or not.
                   </em>
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  To some observers, this speech is the "beginning of the conundrum" and clearly states the motivation of the Hess flight was to "gain access to the certain circles that could remove Churchill and his government from power."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In a further blow to the "spontaneous event" explanation for the Hess flight, "by the time of his flight to Scotland, several contacts had
                  <em>
                   already
                  </em>
                  been made between the German and British peace parties." In addition, discussions had already taken place in Sweden, Switzerland and Spain.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Hess was not flying to add to the detail--that had already been agreed. He was flying in
                   <em>
                    to seal the deal
                   </em>
                   and his arrival was to demonstrate his commitment--at the highest level.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The reason Scotland was chosen as the destination was because of the German "peace party" and its connection to the Duke of Hamilton, Scotland's highest ranking peer, who had access to the Royal Family. Hess had been doing his homework as well, even brushing up on the British Constitution itself:
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   The British constitution is not a "written document," but rather has evolved from various covenants, conventions, precedents and courses of performance over time. One of these "courses of performance" well-established in British constitutional practice is that the Monarch "should act upon ministerial advice."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   However, there
                   <em>
                    were and are
                   </em>
                   cases in recent British history where the Monarch acted independently from the ministerial advice of his or her own government, and actually
                   <em>
                    created
                   </em>
                   British policy.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  The British sovereign has certain "reserve powers" that can be used in times of constitutional crisis.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   The powers included the appointment and dismissal of ministers; the summoning and dissolution of Parliament; the making of treaties; declaration of war; recognition of foreign states; and the accreditation and reception of their diplomats.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This was the reason that Hess was obtaining books on the British Constitution in April 1941. He could request the monarch to invoke royal prerogative, dismiss the prime minister and, presumably, appoint in his place a prime minister who would act in accordance with the King's wish--to make a peace treaty with Germany.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  In other words, Hess wasn't merely petitioning the Duke of Hamilton, rather he was using the Duke to petition King George VI himself.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Hess was "quite able" under the British constitution to achieve an overthrow of the British government of Winston Churchill. It was to be, in effect, another "Churchill-Halifax moment," for after all, it was George VI who made the decision to appoint Churchill using precisely the royal prerogative, and not Lord Halifax, to the premiership in May of 1940.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Hess's infamous flight is beginning to seem less fanciful after all.

                  <p>
                   As one plunges deeper into the Hess Mess, a tangled web of covert connections is uncovered. Various correspondence from the time reveals a Haushofer-Hess peace faction in Germany that was carrying on secretive discussions with the British peace faction. In addition, they often attempted to avoid
                   <em>
                    both
                   </em>
                   the official channels of Great Britain and Germany for much of this correspondence. In one of these letters, Albrect Haushofer stated:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    If the worst came to the worst, the English would rather transfer their whole Empire bit by bit to the Americans than sign a peace that left to National Socialist Germany the mastery of Europe.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   In addition, the "only genuine solution to European peace and security was a European federation, and a "fusion" between Germany and Britain, a fusion that the English are now about to conclude with the United States."
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Note that Haushofer is
                    <em>
                     not
                    </em>
                    talking about an
                    <em>
                     alliance
                    </em>
                    of the UK and USA, but of
                    <em>

                    </em>
                    , the old goal of Cecil Rhodes. If true, then it provides yet another motivation for Hess's flight, for such a "fusion" had to be prevented at all costs, and in spite of any chances of the success of a "peace mission," the risks of
                    <em>
                     not
                    </em>
                    doing so were far higher.

                  <p>
                   However, according to Albrecht Haushofer, there seemed to be very little possibility of a negotiated peace with Hitler.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Which brings us to a key question: What did Hitler know about the flight?
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>

                    </em>
                    in the Nazi hierarchy knew about it, for we have already encountered the fact that Göring knew about it, ordered General Galland to shoot him down, and then, a day later in front of Hitler, claimed no knowledge at all!
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   It seems much more likely, given what appear to be the coup plotters' eventual goals, that Hitler was kept in the loop
                   <em>
                    to a certain extent
                   </em>
                   , but not entirely.
                  </p>

                   <p>
                    The Hess initiative was not the only peace feelers being sent out. Many levels of the Nazi regime were involved, all of them leading back to Hitler himself, who repeatedly indicated that Germany and Britain were not natural enemies, an idea that he had absorbed from Karl Haushofer via his influence on his own Deputy.
                   </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  <p>
                   Despite these attempts at negotiation, the response from Britain was unwavering: their distrust of Hitler was a "fatal obstacle" to any peace. Notably absent is any reference to peace
                   <em>
                    with Germany.
                   </em>
                   The Germans had similar demands regarding the future of the Churchill government.
                  </p>
                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    For the German side, it was "get rid of Churchill," and for the British it was "get rid of Hitler." No peace was possible with
                    <em>
                     either
                    </em>
                    government, and thus, if there was to

                     be
                    </em>
                    a negotiated peace,

                    governments would have to go.

                   <p>
                    Hess's flight was not simply to "seal a peace deal" but that, in order to seal that deal, it was also a component in a wider scheme to overthrow both governments in internationally and bilaterally coordinated coups d'etat.

                   Hess's plane itself, a Me 110E-2/N series aircraft, had undergone significant modification, including custom drop tanks and enhancements to his radio system.

                    The airstrip at Dungavel was, quite simply, not long enough to accommodate an aircraft of the ME 110's size. Thus, if the target

                    </em>

                   <p>
                    In short, Hess needed (1) someone with RAF command authority; and (2) he needed a peer, i.e., someone with access to the Monarch, and the Duke of Hamilton was both.

                    According to the standard narrative of the Hess flight that was rather abruptly decided upon by both the British and German authorities, Hess was a madman with mad intentions, and such a notion of a significant "peace faction" in Britain was almost entirely fanciful. But was it?

                     For certain high-ranking elements of the British establishment, the financial district and the anti-war peers, the fundamental problem was that they feared Britain would further indebt itself to the United States, leading to an eventual breakup of the Empire.

                    <p>
                     At the same time, these individuals also--rightly--saw the Soviet Union as the other major threat to Britain's Empire and hence, caught between the "bi-polar" world that would actually emerge after the war.

                     There is evidence that such a union was being seriously contemplated at that time--and its timing was directly related to Hess's flight. According to a White House spokesmen, President Roosevelt was to make a speech to the Pan-American Conference on 14 May 1941 of a "historic" nature. The White House leaks left the media buzzing with speculation.

                     The respected Washington-based journalist Leonard Engel wrote: "I have strong reason to believe Roosevelt will come out in favour of a union of the United States and Britain. He will probably specify the end of the war as the occasion for such a merger of the two great English-speaking nations, but I believe he will suggest an earlier date."

                    <p>
                     Because virtually no one seems to know about this proposal, it is tempting to deny that such a thing was even a possibility. Two days before Roosevelt was scheduled to give his momentous speech--and two days after Hess's arrival--he cancelled it.

                     There was thus, within British aristocracy at that time, not only a widespread "pro-Germany" peace movement, but also another movement ideologically at loggerheads with this goal, represented by Rhodes and his own deep contacts within the aristocracy that wished for Britain, not to cast its lot with Germany, but with the USA.

                     The British peace faction could hardly have been ignorant of General Haushofer's understanding of the term, since it had been in open contact with him and his son Albrecht before the outbreak of the war.

                    <p>
                     Haushofer's concept was a rejection of the imperial policies of the German Empire prior to WWI, namely the acquisition of overseas colonies and a large navy. For Haushofer, the
                     <em>
                      Lebensraum
                     </em>
                     concept meant eastward expansion of the borders of the Reich to incorporate the resource-rich regions of Eastern Europe and European Russia, not the acquisition of overseas colonies.

                    <p>
                     Thus, while Hitler from time to time had made reacquisition of Germany's lost African and Pacific colonies and bases a matter of public discussion, it was not high on his list of priorities.

                      </em>

                     The future Duke of Hamilton may therefore have been appealing directly to parties in Germany that were uncomfortable with the direction Hitler's Reich was taking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The same day that the future Duke of Hamilton's "peace message" was published in the
                     <em>
                      Times,
                     </em>
                     the German BBC service broadcast the letter.

                      <em>
                       [the Duke] is to be the contact within the peace group. Should anyone in Germany be willing to discuss these terms they should talk to him.

                    <p>
                     This letter may ultimately be one of the most crucial elements of the entire Hess Mess, as it becomes clear that either Hess "undertook his mission with the intention of dissembling to the British, concluding a peace, and keeping Hitler in power;
                     <em>
                      or
                     </em>
                     he undertook his mission with the intention of participating in the overthrow of Hitler's government, in order to procure a peace with Britain."

                    <p>
                     Despite Hess's loyalty towards Hitler, this possibility is strengthened by the curious actions of Göring on the night of Hess's flight, as well as Göring's own history of conducting peace negotiations with the British. Göring was Hitler's successor in offices of
                     <em>

                     An attempt had even been made in 1941 via contacts between the Duke of Hamilton and the Haushofers for the Duke and Hess to meet on neutral territory, specifically Lisbon.

                    <p>
                     Regardless, it was clear that preparations for a meeting continued on the German side, and this fact alone invalidates the nation that Hess decided to undertake such an absurd mission on some "crazy lark."

                    <p>
                     In addition, at Hess's express bidding, Albrect Haushofer had been negotiations with the British ambassador in Madrid,

                     It has even been claimed that Haushofer, Hess, Halifax and Hoare had planned a secret meeting somewhere in Portugal or Spain in early 1941. The French press even reported that Hess was in Spain in 1941, compelling the German press to issue a denial of the French story.
                    </p>

                     <p>
                      The British Foreign Office contacted King Carol of Romania--then exiled in Seville--for details. He confirmed that Hess had visited Madrid. Puzzled by Hoare's silence on the presence of such a high-ranking Nazi, the Foreign Office demanded to know if this was true: Sir Samuel's reply is a masterpiece of diplomatic--but curiously transparent--evasion. He said that if Hess were in Spain 'his arrival has been kept remarkably secret and his presence in town is not even rumoured yet."

                      Although the files of correspondence between the Madrid Embassy and the Foreign Office were routinely released to the Public Record Office after fifty years, all the documents relating to the weekend of 20-22 April 1941 have been held back until 2017.

                    <p>
                     It should be noted that three of the men who allegedly met in early 1941, Hess, Haushofer, and Halifax, were all deeply disturbed by the policies of the Nazis toward the Jews. In 1938, Lord Halifax himself had attempted to initiate discussions in the War Cabinet about providing a Jewish homeland in Western Australia or British Guiana.

                    <p>
                     Could Hess really bring himself to lead a coup d'etat against Hitler himself? An essay from his university days may give us a clue, namely that although Germany needed a "severe and ruthless" leader, notably, once he had succeeded in restoring Germany's standing in the world, "he would have to stand aside and allow a more moderate government to assume power."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     To add further credence to this theory, in his initial contacts with the British after his capture, Hess indicated that he was
                     <em>
                      not
                     </em>
                     speaking for Hitler, but for
                     <em>
                      Germany.

                     <p>
                      The German press, in the weeks and even days immediately prior to Hess's flight, the Deputy was being given even more attention than usual by the Nazi-controlled German media, stressing his importance to the regime and to Germany. The implication is clear: Hess not only was capable of being involved in such a scheme, but there may have been a quiet, concerted propaganda campaign to prepare the German people for his assumption of power with a more moderate coalition government, perhaps one including Göring.

                    <p>
                     Why then did Hess undertake such a flight at great personal risk to Great Britain itself?

                      </em>
                      to go to Britain, because his British counterpart, for whatever reason, was unable to meet Hess on "neutral territory."

                    <p>
                     When Hess was forced to parachute and land in a Scottish farmer's field, he was therefore "up for grabs" between two potentially opposing factions within the British government/intelligence apparatus. Conflicting narratives in the official account of what occurred after Hess's capture strongly support this scenario.

                      One version of events has Hess apprehended by a farmer armed with a pitchfork and then held captive in a cottage. At this point Hess insisted he was "Captain Alfred Horn" and that he had come to Scotland to meet the Duke of Hamilton. After getting taken into custody by the Home Guard, he was moved several times until finally ending up in the

                      According to the farmer's own account, Hess's first words were "Am I on the estate of the Duke of Hamilton?" Another early account indicated that Hess additionally stated to the police that his original intention had been to land at the small landing strip at the Duke's residence at Dungavel. Since Hess almost certainly would've known the strip would be too small for his plane, it's possible that by claiming this "he was protecting someone, or something, or both."

                      After he was taken to the cottage, the farmer's wife offered "Captain Horn" some tea, which Hess declined in good English. Strangely enough, two soldiers seem to suddenly "appear" in the cottage by the farmer's own account, with no explanation as to when they arrived...there are just suddenly

                       At this point, the two soldiers in the cottage responded that beer was what they drank in Britain, to which Hess replied that they drank it in Munich, where he came from. Even more interestingly, these two soldiers, Emyr Morris and Daniel McBride, were from a nearby top secret anti-aircraft signals unit.

                      After the war, McBride gave his own version of events, with the extraordinary claim that "high-ranking Government officials were aware of his coming." To support this assertion, McBride noted that "no air-raid warning were sounded, nor were the anti-aircraft gunnery control rooms plotting the course of Hess's plane alerted."

The door was flung open and a Home Guard officer rushed in, followed by a number of his men.

                      To add to the air of intrigue surrounding Hess's capture, after McBride's death, a letter was discovered from his former commander W.B. Howieson that had advised McBride to "drop this Hess business" lest he "stir up a hornets' nest" with respect to the British Official Secrets Act. Perhaps even more remarkably, this letter was dated May 8,

                       How could this story "stir up a hornets' nest" in 1974? Howieson's letter implies that if the seemingly minor point of who captured Hess is admitted, other--much more damaging--information will somehow naturally flow from it, which is presumably why McBride's official report is still withheld. It seems that Howieson knew that something passed between McBride and Hess that night that is not even mentioned in the signaller's papers, which he seems to have been about to make public.

                       Presumably Howieson's words of caution persuaded McBride not to do so. But something significant must have passed between the two,

                      Regardless of how he was captured, Hess eventually was taken to

                      At Giffnock we encounter another important player in the Hess Mess, one Major Graham Donald, an officer in the Royal Observer Corps. Major Donald claims he was alerted to the crash and ordered to the scene, and he subsequently accompanied Hess and the entourage to Giffnock where he personally questioned Hess.

                      It should be noted that the official narrative leaves out a curious, and perhaps not so insignificant, detail: Did nobody
                      <em>
                       recognize
                      </em>
                      Hess? Hess was perhaps one of the most recognizable faces in the Nazi regime, and yet none of his British captors had
                      <em>
                       openly
                      </em>
                      acknowledged recognizing him. Perhaps even more curiously, Major Donald claims to have "determined" Hess's identity by almost ridiculous means.
                     </p>
                     <blockquote>
                      <p>
                       Donald turned the conversation to Munich and its good beer (beer again!), and Donald then goes on to assert that Hess reacted very disapprovingly at the mention of beer. Donald concluded that he was a teetotaler, and since there were only two teetotalers in the upper echelons of the Reich--Hitler and Hess--and since the man in front of him obviously was not Hitler, he had to be Hess!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This is a long way to go to explain an obvious thing by unobvious and completely absurd deductive processes, for Hess was a familiar face in the newsreels of the period; one had only to look at him and see that it was Hess, or at least, a close facsimile thereof. One did not need absurd explanation about "teetotalers in the Nazi regime."

                       The Duke maintained that he had contacted the Foreign Office in the afternoon, and the official who answered the phone refused to connect him to a superior without a stated reason, which frustrated the Duke. Fortunately, Colville seems to have just "shown up" at the right time. According to the Duke, Colville claimed that he was ordered to the Foreign Office by Churchill because the Duke "had some interesting information" to convey.

                      <p>
                       However, according to Colville's version of events, the phone call took place in the morning, and his first words to the Duke were "Has somebody arrived?," a statement that suggests that "he, at least, was expecting a certain 'somebody.'" Regardless, contact was made:

                       <p>
                        The Duke immediately flew south to meet Churchill personally at Ditchley Hall--Churchill's secret wartime country residence--and apprise him of the development. The next day, Churchill ordered Ivone Kirkpatrick to Scotland in order to identify the prisoner. Kirkpatrick served in the Foreign Office and personally knew Hess.

                       After the Duke had briefed Churchill, the Prime Minister offered one of his many legendary quips: 'Well, Hess or no Hess, I'm going to see the Marx Brothers.'

                        Who were the "Marx brothers"? This was not a reference to a film, but rather a code that Churchill used to refer to the Royal Family, and in particular, the brother-princes of King George VI.

                        </em>
                        during the time when he was supposed to be at Mytchett Place. According to this information, which may or may not have been spread as part of an intelligence deception campaign: "Hess had been housed in a villa in Scotland, had his personal servants and wanted for nothing. Churchill had expressly decreed that Hess, on account of his rank, should be accommodated as a general."

                        The Hess "double" theory not only explains the need to duplicate his uniform, but it also explains the

                        </em>
                        reports of Hess in two different places at once. In this scenario, the "Hess" at Maindiff was a double, and the multiple drugging sessions "Hess" underwent after his arrival at Maindiff were in fact mind-control sessions. Similarly, this would explain the decision of the British to build an entire "suite" at their military hospital in Berlin for Hess.

However, at the time of these alleged meetings, by official accounts "Hess" was at Mytchett Place.

                         Politically, there could be any number of reasons for the creation of a double, from the need to protect the real Hess from assassination or rescue attempts, to the need of the Churchill government to present a facade that "Hess was cooperating" with the sitting British government and not trying to topple it.

                        While often dismissed as fanciful, support for this claim was uncovered by Hess Mess researchers who were anonymously contacted by someone at the Foreign Office. With regards to Hess's claim, the contact replied that a British colonel name "Pilcher" has been ordered to be held incommunicado at Balmoral Palace from 1941 until his death in 1970 for "signing a letter of safe conduct in the King's name."

                         In addition, according to researchers of the Hess Mess, the Duke of Kent was a member of a "reception committee" that had congregated to receive Hess. Allegedly, this "committee" consisted of members of the British "peace" faction, as well as representatives of the Polish government in exile and the international Red Cross.

                          The reception of the Poles in the reception committee thus is logical from two points of view: (1) the Poles would

                          to have been involved in any general peace settlement between Britain and Germany, because of the former's guarantee and the latter's military occupation of the country, and (2) because the offer of the Polish throne to the Duke of Kent may have been a
                          <em>

                          of the peace plan previously negotiated between Hess and his British counterparts; for the Germans, the Duke would have represented an acceptable head of state for any reestablished Polish rump state.

                          This near cessation of intense combing suggests that not only was there coordination between the British and German sides surrounding Hess's peace mission, but that Hess and Göring were both involved in the plot. This idea was confirmed by Hess himself in his statements to Churchill's representative, Ivone Kirkpatrick, for he stated that "he and Göring were working to the same agenda."

                         Curiously, one of the places the "bi-locating" Hess was sighted in 1942 was at the home of an "equerry to the Duke of Kent, a point that indicates that the "peace party" had regained control of the real Hess."

Tragically his aircraft crashed on a rocky crag in Scotland known as Eagle's Rock. The Duke was killed, becoming the first member of the Royal Family to die in military service in five centuries.

                         However, the "flight to Iceland" may have been a cover story. The Duke's flying boat was painted

                         </em>
                         , suggesting that Sweden, not Iceland, was the destination. And that's not all:

                          Additionally, the flight plan itself has disappeared, and the weather service personnel on the east coast of Scotland were sworn to secrecy and forced to sign Britain's Official Secrets Act. Why the weather personnel on the east coast of Scotland? Because the Duke of Kent's aircraft had taken off from the east coast and not, as one would expect for a flight to Iceland, the west coast.

                         Göring had already conducted peace discussions with Sweden, so it's entirely possible that the Duke of Kent was attempting to return Hess to Germany to remove him from danger and/or complete final arrangements in the "deal."

                         In addition, a cable from the German Ambassador in Portugal to the German Foreign Ministry was uncovered that states:

                         <p>
                          As the Embassy has learned, confidentially, the death of the duke of Kent has been discussed recently in the innermost circles of the British club here. The gist of the talk being that an act of sabotage was involved.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It is said that the Duke, like the Duke of Windsor, was sympathetic towards an understanding with Germany and so gradually had become a problem for the government clique. The people who were accompanying him were supposed to have expressed themselves along similar lines, so that getting them out of the way would also have been an advantage.

                         To make matters even more suspicious, General Sikorski, the head of the Polish government in exile that had allegedly offered the Polish crown to the Duke of Kent, perished less than a year later in an air crash off Gibraltar.

                          Additionally, a very serious message had been sent to the King and Royal family, one indicating that further interference would not be acceptable. And finally, the head of the Polish government in exile might also have been "taken out." Everyone who could talk about the "details" of the plan was eliminated.

                           Dulles had reason to believe that the man Dr. Cameron was to examine was not Rudolf Hess but an impostor; that the real Hess had been secretly executed on Churchill's orders. Dulles had explained that Dr. Cameron could prove the point by a simple physical examination of the man's torso. If he was the genuine Hess, there should be scar tissue over his left lung, a legacy from the day the young Hess had been wounded in the First World War.

                           Cameron was never to make that examination. The next day, when Hess was brought to him, he was handcuffed to a British Military Police sergeant, who refused point blank to remove the handcuffs so that Cameron could take the prisoner's shirt off--or even unbutton it--to look at his chest.

                          After sharing his suspicions with the Hess family, Frau Hess maintained that although she believed "Hess" was indeed her husband, she also confirmed that he had suffered severe wounds during WWI that left significant scarring.

                          In hopes of putting the various conspiracy theories to rest, "Hess's" body was exhumed after his suspicious death, and the Foreign Office announced that they did indeed discover a "fibrous, irregular roughly circular old scar typical of an exit wound in a posterior position on the left side of the chest." But this "proof" raises even more questions:

                           Clearly, Hess's medical records at the British Military Hospital where he had been treated for over twenty years did not record either the front or back scar. Either they were astonishingly inefficient, or the scars simply did not exist.

                          To make matters even more confusing, "Hess" managed to read a newspaper article about Thomas' book in spite of strict regulations at Spandau. When a visiting French pastor asked the prisoner about his "wounds" or lack thereof, he was informed that "a bullet had passed right through his chest, brushing the heart and exiting under the left shoulder blade."

                          Another potentially significant anomaly worth mentioning is the curious case of his British dental charts, the first taken in September 1941 during his stay at Mytchett place and then again from 1943 and Maindiff Court. According to the Doppelgänger Hess theory, the 1941 "Hess" was genuine and the 1943 "Hess" was a substitute.

                           While the filling and bridgework are similar, though not identical, a glaring problem emerges with the fact that the 1941 chart records a crown and a gold tooth which are missing from the 1943 chart. Such a discrepancy could be the result of mere sloppy record keeping, or it could be result of very accurate recording-keeping, and hence, also be an oversight on the part of British intelligence which forgot to "scrub" this incriminating fact from the records.

                          A few more "discrepancies" are worth mentioning, despite potentially being mere insignificant details. Specifically, the "real" Hess was a committed anti-smoker, a vegetarian, and had impeccable table manners, yet prisoner "Hess" craved cigarettes, ate meat, and displayed markedly poor table manners while in captivity.

                         <p>
                          In addition, according to Frau Hess, her husband "played tennis well and with enthusiasm," and yet the British captive allegedly knew nothing about the sport. His wife also noted that upon finally seeing him in 1969, he "had a deeper voice." This last point is potentially more significant than it might seem, as "a normal man's voice

                          Inspired by these disturbing discoveries, Dr. Thomas began to notice something "off" about the admittedly detailed letters "Hess" had written to his family while in captivity:
                         </p>
                         <blockquote>
                          <p>
                           At first sight the numerous references to family affairs and friends seem to constitute obvious proof that the writer of the letters was Hess himself. Yet if the correspondence is studied in chronological order, a striking pattern soon emerges.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           A very high proportion of the events and people mentioned occur first in earlier letters which the prisoner had received from Germany: almost everything he says about his former life is an echo of something already written by another correspondent.
                          </p>

                          Thomas's account would seem to vindicate the suspicions of Allen Dulles, and as a result, the presence of Dr. Cameron becomes pregnant with implications.

                           Dr. Cameron was by no means the first in this field, as "British psychiatrists L.G.M. Page and R.J. Russell first published a paper about similar techniques in 1948, a paper summarizing many years of intensive experimentation."

                            In Cameron's hands, the techniques pioneered by the British psychiatrists would be taken to new levels, one implications of which was that an amnesiac, quasi-somnambulistic state could be induced by cocktails of drugs, and prolonged sleep, during which patients--or rather, victims--were highly susceptible to suggestion, including the inducement of false memories.

                            The implications of this meeting are profound, for it suggests (1) that "Hess" was already the deliberate subject of such mind-control techniques, and (2) that those techniques were being used to create the "Manchurian Candidate," the perfect, mind-controlled assassin and spy.

                            The need for constant "reinforcement" of these induced memories and patterns of behavior might explain why the British government constructed an entire "Hess suite" in its military hospital in Berlin.

                           To reinforce this theory, the "Hess" at the Nuremberg trials was often confused and expressed difficulty at remembering details of key events. In addition, he also claimed that the British were drugging him:

However, one of Hess's physicians dissented, writing "I cannot accept his own statement that the memory loss never existed. There was at that time a true partial dissociation of the personality, which permitted the patient to 'take in' what was going on around him but caused difficult of recall." At Nuremberg, "Hess" elaborated:
                          </p>
                          <blockquote>
                           <p>
                            Slowly my memory returned fully, even though the brain poison was given to me for at least two years. The latter was the reason that I continued to pretend to have a loss of memory. Since I have been given a brain poison on each possible occasion in Nuremberg I again took to "feigning a lack of memory" in an increasing manner. Only at the moment I began to make my closing statement did I let my memory "return."
                           </p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <p>
                           At one point, Hess replied to an officer who called his name: "There is no Rudolf Hess here. But if you are looking for Convict Number 125, then I'm your man!"

                           In addition, Göring reported pressed "Hess" to divulge some "great secret" on numerous occasions. Even more notably, Hess reportedly
                           <em>
                            failed to recognize

                           Göring and Haushofer at Nuremberg.

                          <p>
                           In his final statement to the Tribunal, "Hess" made his last public statement ever, talking of the "predictions" he said he had made before the start of the trial:
                          </p>
                          <blockquote>
                           <p>
                            Predictions that people would make false statement on oath; that some of the defendants would act strangely. *He spoke of former political trials where the defendants actually clapped in frenzied approval when their death sentences were passed.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            It all pointed to the same ever influence; the secret force that made men act and speak "according to the orders given them."
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Hess suggested that the German concentration camp guards, and the scientists who experimented on the inmates, were under a similar form of control as the Moscow defendants, and even that Hitler's reported mental abnormalities in the final years were due to an external cause.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            "Some of them were changed from time to time. Some of the new ones who came in place of those who had been changed had strange eyes. They were glassy and like eyes in a dream. This symptom, however, lasted only a few days and then they made a completey normal impression."
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Note that "Hess" is alleging some sort of "mind control" experiment is taking place, one of truly international extent, for it is, by his confused lights, occurring not just in the Soviet Union, and not just in Nazi Germany, but in Great Britain as well, with his own doctors and guards apparently subject to some sort of "procedure" prior to becoming involved with him.

                           While most dismiss these ramblings as an attempt to deflect responsibility away from Hitler and the Nazis, researchers of the Hess Mess have suggested that "his real goal is not justification of Nazi atrocities, but rather, simply to persuade the Tribunal that such things are possible because he was building up to some revelation concerning himself."
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In fact, during Hess's closing remarks, this revelation was perhaps to be forthcoming, as right when he stated "In the spring of 1942..." he was interrupted by the president of the tribunal and informed that he was at the end of his allotted speaking time.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The Tribunal would understandably
                           <em>
                            not

                           want Hess to make too many statements about "mind control" on the record and in such a public venue, at the very least to prevent it from being used as an "insanity" defense.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           One physician in particular tried to prevent "Hess" from even standing trial:
                          </p>
                          <blockquote>
                           <p>
                            The only physician urging that "Hess" was
                            <em>
                             not
                            </em>
                            fit to stand trial was Lord Moran, personal physician of Winston Churchill, who had literally pushed himself into the three-man British team of physicians at Nuremberg and who omitted all reference to his diagnosis of "Hess's" unfitness for trial from his memoirs."
                           </p>
                          </blockquote>
                          <p>
                           Indeed, if "Hess" had not stood trial, he would not have gone free. "Instead, he would have been incarcerated in a top-security mental institution somewhere in Britain."
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           It may never have been the intention for "Hess" to stand trial, but "Hess" thwarted this by giving a speech insisting that he was indeed mentally fit.

                            What did these four powers know? Researchers into the Hess Mess have suggested that one of these "secrets" might have to do with the curious nature of Germany's "surrender" at the end of WWII, which notably

                             signed any document of the surrender of the German state itself, nor any document outlawing the Nazi Party.

                             Yet, no effort was undertaken to tidy up the legal niceties, and that indeed may have been the point: so long as "Hess" was alive, those niceties remained to connect the modern German state to the previous one in an unbroken chain of legal ties dating--if one wanted to assemble the mountain of documentation to sustain the argument--all the way back to the holy Roman Empire. Perhaps, for whatever reason, the Four Allied Powers wished to break that link entirely.

It was even rumored that this would be announced when the Soviets took their next monthly turn at guarding Hess.

                            Melaouhi, who eventually would have firsthand experience with the extremely suspicious circumstances surrounding the eventual death of "Hess," would become convinced that his patient was murdered, and would later write a book on the event called

                            Taken in the context of the extremely turbulent political climate at the time, the incarceration and alleged murder of Prisoner Number Seven becomes astonishingly significant.

                             His death itself, and its timing, also forms party of the mystery, for it is as if "Hess's" death was the agreed-upon signal to flip a switch, for within half of a decade of his death, the leaders of three of the countries that had stood guard over him.

                             Gorbachev, Reagan, and Thatcher were gone; Reagan's vice president, George H.W. Bush, whose father had his own odd connections to the Nazis, was president; Germany was reunified, and within months, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were broken up; Margaret Thatcher was ousted from her premiership and from the Conservative Party leadership, fulminating against the growing signs of a European Union from the back benches, warning of the dangers of a common currency and the loss of British sovereignty.

                             I realized that Hess couldn't have hanged himself even if he had tried. Toward the end of his life, my patient was so weak that he needed a special chair with an electric lifting device to even get up. It was impossible for Hess to have killed himself in the manner described by the Allies by placing a cable around his neck and tying it into a knot and then either handing or strangling himself to death.

He would therefore have been unable to tie a knot in a cord or cable--he couldn't even tie his shoelaces. He also couldn't lift his arms above his shoulders so that he never would have been able to tie a cord to the handle of the window from he allegedly hanged himself.

Upon his return to the scene later that day, "almost everything had been moved including all the traces of what had happened." Melaouhi also noticed "several strange men" milling about the area.

                            Within 48 hours of the death of Prisoner Number Seven, the facility began to be demolished to make room for a new shopping center. While this was ostensibly done to prevent Spandau from becoming a "Neo-Nazi" shrine (shades of the "death" of Osama bin Laden), one can't help but recall other incidents where the "evidence" was disposed of under curious circumstances, namely in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing and the attack on the World Trade Center complex on 9/11.

                             Wolf Hess, the only child of the enigmatic Nazi, could never accept that the prisoner he had grown to love might not be his real father. However, he was extremely vocal about his suspicions of the medical treatments "Hess" was receiving.

In one instance he refers to a "coup-like transfer" of the prisoner to the hospital, and that a well-timed "peculiar" letter that Wolf received that prompted a visit may have "forestalled a murder-by-medical-emergency."

                             Despite assurances that Hess would be returned to Spandau within 24 hours, Wolf was eventually told that "his father did not want to see him until the

                              Through an open door, I could see my father, about 10 feet away. The attendants had pushed two chairs together, sat him down on them like a string puppet and covered him with a blanket. He looked frightening: pale, hollow-cheeked, eyes sunk deep into their sockets, flickering and looking unsteadily into a void. He was obviously not in full possession of his faculties. What had they done to him? I don't know for how long I stared at my father like that.

                              The French Governor went to my father and spoke to him, insistently, like one might speak to a child, or to someone who is not all there. He had a surprise for him, he said, his son was here and wanted to speak to him. My father interrupted the Frenchman, his voice sounded hollow and alien. No, he said, he didn't want to speak to his son now, not until month's end. He repeated this in the exact same words he had scribbled down on that paper. It was eerie. Was he drugged?

                              I couldn't take it anymore. I took a step forward and said loud and clear: "Father, I am your son and am here to talk to you. Can you recognize me?"

                              What would happen? Would the commandants drag me out of the room? Nothing happened, they stood behind me as if in silent fascination. My father showed no sign of recognition, his face was unchanged.

                              He just repeated, as though memorized or forced, the one senseless sentence he had already expressed in writing. I repeated my question twice, a little louder each time. Then I gave up. we left. There was deathly silence, none of the Governors even said a word.

                              14 days later, I found my father in almost splendid health--quite "his own self" again, one could say..But for me, it was the ultimate proof that something was very wrong on March 12, 1987. My father's condition at that time cannot have had any natural causes, it must have been artificially induced.

The secret service action whose aim was the murder of Reich Minister Rudolf Hess was so hastily planned that it was not even given a code name, which is absolutely not customary.

                              A potentially vital aspect of the Hess Mess discussed by Wolf Hess and others is the "Jewish Question," which may be one of the most significant facets of this entire opera. It's worth mentioning that the government of Israel "made numerous requests to Great Britain to be able to interview 'Spandau Hess' about his peace proposals. These requests were always refused."

                              privately warned Carter that "Hess" must not leave Spandau alive. Wolf offers the following speculation:

                               My father presented Churchill with the plan for a world peace conference. Perhaps the European Jewish Question was to be solved at this meeting as well. For years, Germany had had an interest in the emigration of as many Jews as possible. Due to the

                               In 1939, however, the British had imposed strict quotas on the immigration of Jews into Palestine--a country which did not even belong to the British--and restricted such immigration to wealthy Jews only. So the Haavara Agreement saw to it that Jews with insufficient wealth could get a loan large enough for them to meet the immigration criteria so that they could leave Germany nevertheless. And in fact, Jews left Germany for Palestine as late as 1941.

                               Despite that, the stubborn anti-Jewish attitude of the British hampered Germany's plans and incidentally does not shine a very positive light on British policies with respect to Jews. It it not impossible that my father was to negotiate with the British on this issue.

                              At this point it's worth mentioning the claims of Colonal Pilcher, who has been already mentioned as being the potential person who signed the cover letter for Hess granting Royal protection. According to Pilcher, Hess came over with goal of toppling Hitler:

                               Hess had become alarmed about the war and coming Nazi excesses. He believed a total reversal of strategy and policy to be essential. He had heard stories that Queen Mary, the Duke of Windsor, the Dukes of Westminster and Cucclech, the Marquis of Londonderry, Lords Halifax and Rushcliffe, Basil Liddell Hart and R.A. Butler thought so too.

                               Churchill himself believed that the influential American-Jewish lobby was highly successful in mobilizing support for America's entry into WWI, and thus could be influential in doing the same in WWII. To pursue a peace with Germany at the expense of throwing the Soviet Union to the Nazi wolf would only activate those influential lobbies against his government, for those lobbies were very pro-Soviet.

                              After Hess's fateful flight, the Reich's policy towards Jewish emigration changed, leading some to suggest that the events were related:

If these orders are indeed linked to the apparent failure of Hess's mission they add credibility to the claim that the peace proposals Hess brought included the resettlement of European Jews in Palestine.

                               itself was a component of the Hess peace plan, as Hess himself certainly was privy to whatever may have been accomplished or "discovered" in Antarctica. Hess's connection with the Thule Society is worth mentioning in this context as well, and with our return to the occult we've at last come full circle.

                                 The mysterious flight of Rudolf Hess was both a peace mission and an international coup-d'etat. Hitler had knowledge of the flight, but this knowledge was limited because the ultimate goal was for Hitler to be deposed and replaced by Hess. High level Nazis were involved in the planning of this coup. A "peace party" in Britain had similar goals to replace the Churchill government, and involved members of the Royal family.
                                </p>

                                 Due to possible miscalculations during the flight, Hess bailed out and was unable to meet up with his reception committee, which allegedly included the Dukes of Hamilton and Kent, members of the Red Cross, and personnel from a nearby Royal Air Force Base.

                                 captain's uniform. This was the first in a series of suspicious events that have led many to speculate that a double of the Deputy may have been prepared almost immediately.

                                 At some point, the real Hess either escaped or was transferred to a new location in Scotland. Meanwhile, the "double" remained at Maindiff and underwent further drugging and other tests to implant false memories.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                 The real Hess was then killed in an air crash while on a secret mission with the Duke of Kent, a mission that was potentially meant to return Hess to Germany and initiate the next step in the coup.
                                </p>

                                 The double took the real Hess's place at Nuremberg and exhibited erratic behavior. Allen Dulles suspected that "Hess" was a double and brought in MK-Ultra-linked Dr. Ewen Cameron to examine the prisoner.

                                 Hess was forced to spend the rest of his life in captivity, and for many years an entire facility was dedicated to housing the prisoner, despite all of the other Nazis being released. In the 1970's, a British doctor examined Hess and was stunned to find no scarring from the devastating war wounds he had allegedly suffered as a youth. As a result, significant doubts continue to be raised as to the identity of Prisoner Number Seven.

                               Though the researchers of the Mess Hess differ on the details, one inescapable conclusion emerges: The murder of "Rudolf Hess" was a political assassination and an international conspiracy of the highest order.

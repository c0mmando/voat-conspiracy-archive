Here is an archive of one post where is it is missing: <a href="https://archive.fo/SCIgq">https://archive.fo/SCIgq</a></p>
<p>I am a hacker. I did not hack the DNC but I know who did. It was not the Russians but a German team of hackers who is well known to the Clintons. They are very Pro-Trump and do not reside in the US or Russia. They know who he is. He has threatened them before. It is easier to blame Russia as blaming a single hacker will get them no where in the effect of and call to light the reasons why he and the Clintons are at odds.</p>
<p>There is no &quot;evidence&quot; of Russian involvement. Heres how it works. You use VPNs purchased anonymously online. You are in country X. Knowing that you are going against a US target you use Russia or China as an exit. This is because the relations between the countries are never good. Lets plan for a basic hack that will not be investigated... US will never ask Russia for evidence of any servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 1. identify your target in the US. Say clintonemail.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2. Since you are in &quot;UK&quot; set up a vpn on an anonymous email wifi. You want to run a tunnel from there to Russia. Info: <a href="https://anonyvpn.net/">https://anonyvpn.net/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 3. Your computer system will most likely be Kali Linux and running on a VM you will destroy later so no evidence retains on your computer. Info: <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4. Set up Tor. Configure exit nodes to exit Russia at some point in the relay. Info: <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2008/01/29/configure-tor-to-use-a-specific-country-as-an-exit-node/">http://www.ghacks.net/2008/01/29/configure-tor-to-use-a-specific-country-as-an-exit-node/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 5. Attack using known exploits and algorithms blamed on Russia, China in the past. The US feds love the media. And love to tell what methods they find are being blamed on Russian hackers. This is easy to find and important. We want to follow the same exploits and methods that Russia has been blamed for already.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens now is this. Feds investigate the location of the hackers. They find it goes to a Russian server. They see the Russian &quot;methods&quot; they previously blamed and case ends there. They never contact the companies that own the servers in russia to see where it was accessed from and if logs were kept. While we sit in the UK and have no worries since the stupid americans would rather blame Russia or China we can do what we want. We\'ve seen this before and this is why we continue to use these methods. <a href="https://www.sott.net/article/329922-Russian-server-head-on-DNC-hack-No-idea-why-FBI-still-has-not-contacted-us">https://www.sott.net/article/329922-Russian-server-head-on-DNC-hack-No-idea-why-FBI-still-has-not-contacted-us</a></p>
<p>I have worked for other governments hacking and providing security for their own systems. This was a stupid easy attack on idiots. There were many other exploits on that server that ANY 15 yr old with knowledge of Kali penetration tools could have used to gain access and no security on their server. I would have installed a ransomware on their system and exploited them for money but that is me. Give credit where its due and quit making Russia out to be some super hackers that can do anything all over the world. Most in the community know that Russia does not have the best hackers.</p>
<p>The US intelligence community does not hire the best hackers. The government payroll is much less then what a hacker can make in IT Sec or the criminal industry. What they get are college kids with no experience (you need a degree also and the best dont have degrees). Who they contract to these private firms are just their friends companies who also are hiring kids to make a better profit and charge more. Look at next in charge. Guilliani? A guy that knows nothing about it. Heres an idea for the US. Pardon Snowden and put him in charge of the security. For once put someone that understands computers and at least basic coding in charge of it. You cant have a blind guy hiring more blind guys.</p>',

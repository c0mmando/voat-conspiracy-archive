            There's plenty of predictive/occult symbolism associated with Trump in the media since the 1980s but none for Hillary or Biden that I know of. For example, the mattress commercial where he's talking to the 11 and 9 sheep (he became president-elect on 11/9). Make of that what you will.

             Most jews get angry on instinct. The podcast with the two jews (one an m.i.t scientist) talks about trump being a jew shill. Pompeo loves the jews, trumps family is connected with jews. Trump is the 'apprentice' thats job is to 'fire' his fanbase. Basically, trump is to make his fanbase seem rabid and give the msm lots of footage of a republican crowd going wild for a wild acting person. Imo, the jew control both sides, always. The alt right was moulded by jews. Rebel media is a jew organization, the alt right has idiots like Tim pool, Ann coulter, Milo, and whoever are in those groups. They always are super lame unhinged people.

            <p>
             Idk, it seems like there is a satanist (pedos and so on) aspect that controls things. And a zionist jew thing. Idk, it seems impossible to get rid of the satanists..

               controlled opposition. Trump says he listens to alex jones (lol). Alex jones is saying things in such an insane way that it takes a bunch of real information, and packages it a way that makes anyone spouting it (his viewers), seem insane. He is playing controlled op. Same with trump.

              That doesn't work with their history. They've got no explanation for the role of the lost tribes of Israel, so they use the Zionist state as a surrogate.

             I hear random jew openly say they probably or most likely blew up the towers. Or that they believe the country is going to be gone in 50 years. They say it like, yeah the jews are done with you. Wtf, is up with literally every jew that follows the religion knowing information like tower 7 and 9/11 was them. Holocaust was way exaggerated. How does a jew know that donald trump is clearly 'playing

             The one that trouble me are random people associated with jew elites and their position. Elon musk jokes about how he won't use his flame thrower in the room (jokingly), but he says in a dark tone 'that is for later' insinuating that america or the world will crumble by the elite or altogether. This is weird shit when elite people, and random jews are stating these things. What are the odds of such things? and are they radicals in the religion or is evil just part of elitist groups? (jews, freemasons, vaticans, china ccp)

              Those in control don't play odds, they know the outcome of the consequences of your actions, before you act. How? Through the contract of belief they offer you, and if you consent to it, your beliefs will form your intent, which will steer your actions towards consequences, intended by those who offered you the contract.
             </p>
             <p>
              You do not exist in the present; surrounded by a past and a future...you exist within the constant motion of energy, and for a few to control the power that all share, they need to trick the many to ignore the power; to ignore reality, which they did through the contract of belief. If you believe (anything) you mentally uphold a fixed assumption, while restricting your own comprehension of a reality within constant motion.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason why (((they))) know the things that you don't comprehend, is because their minds isn't filled to the brim with lies that self restrict their comprehensions. All the trauma of loss you uphold by believing the past, all the fear you have for the future, and all the stress, which both cause you to believe in an alternative present...they have none of that in their minds. All the distractions created for you (religion, politics, entertainment, education, science, commerce, all the -isms and so on)...their minds are free of all this nonsense.
             </p>
             <p>
              They only have to remember the recent distractions used (cyclically) against you, and when you open your mouth and start to regurgitate all the nonsense, that has nothing to do with reality, they instantly get reminded what the latest trigger distractions are, because you can't stop talking about them, since they define your intent (through the contract of belief).

                First off; all presented numbers are manipulated...age, size, worth, volume, dates, math etc. Control through deception is all encompassing, because it must be, since for a few to control the power of the many within shared energy, the many has to ignore that they have power, and so the few have to deceive the many from comprehending reality if they want to claim (illegitimate) ownership over shared power; offered free for all. They cannot use force, because we coexist within the motion of energy, and so the few using force on the many would put the few at bad odds when the reaction comes around.
               </p>
               <p>
                Next; the min/max lie. We are all temporary constellation of energy, within the motion of energy. So we ALL are ONE in energy. The reason all existence is different is to inspire our senses into creation; namely the creation of order, which between inception and death; with life always running out and death always being unavoidable, is about the maintenance of balance within motion. That is what our survial instincts (which all conscious life-forms share) are demanding us to do; adhering to our needs to survive; adhering the laws of nature; adhering to struggle for order by upholding the balance between the positive (towards life) and the negative (towards death) consequences of all our actions.
               </p>
               <p>
                Energy depletes by itself, which creates motion within energy, which creates a temporary momentum (that's where we are), which creates the need for balance, and the need for conscious life with the liberty of freedom of choice (that's us). Now for ALL energy to be able to balance within the motion of itself; it has to split up into individual ONEs, to then give them a shared command (survial instinct) so that they create order through balance, which increase their potential, until they unite towards the maximum potentiality of ALL energy.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is a self sustaining ecosystem where energy creates motion within itself to recharge it's potentiality. Motion creates energy; energy creates motion. The cyclical nature of energy. What (((they)) don't want us to comprehend is that we ALL are ONE in energy, which is why they divide us endlessly through the contract of belief, because if you proclaim a belief into motion; then all others have to adapt to it, and so you will find yourself in opposition (conflict) with all those who do not believe what you believe. Every belief creates another conflict, and they are the merchants who sell us beliefs (utilizing temptations) through offerings, and afterwards they use contradiction on both sides of the conflicts to keep them going.
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, this is a closed ecosystem and for all existence within, everything is infinite, because the motion defines the barriers for all existence within itself. An inside cannot deplete itself. Water in a sealed bottle is infinite, as long as the bottle is sealed. All shortages are based on them using the power we ignore to restrict our access to it.
               </p>
               <p>
                The forward motion of energy defines order, and everything within the temporary momentum that motion creates; represents chaos, which is why we have to struggle to uphold life (which is running out, because it follows nature's forward motion), and why death represents endless temptations for us, because it represents the easy way of just following the flow (towards our deaths). That's where the survival instinct comes in, because it demands from us to struggle into the opposite direction; by upholding the balance of life within motion. This is btw how the natural laws define "morality"...the survial instinct defines that only our needs lead to upholding life, while everything we don't need (our wants) represent temptations luring us towards death. That's why the merchants are using temptations to get us to ignore our responsibility to maintain balance.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's also no such thing as a so called jew in nature. The few who control the many use every trick in the book to masquerade themselves; including the entire jew identity, which is a never ending clusterfuck of stolen religions, stolen ethnicity, stolen languages, stolen history. This is all about controlling the fake conflicts, because energy is not in conflict; life and death are not in conflict; they're defined by each others coexistence within motion. What they represent is the needed boogeyman that incites the want (temptation) to seek chaos, while ignoring order. If YOU act against anyone; YOU act not for yourself. Against represents what you want, for yourself represents what you need. They sell us into chaos with the "order out of chaos" story (phoenix rising out of the ashes), which is a lie, because only natures forward motion creates order out of chaos, and that is not the direction we need to go.

                Comprehension based on inspiration through adaptation, after I stopped selfishly restricting my comprehension with self imposed beliefs, sold to me by (((others))).
               </p>
               <p>
                YOU are a temporary potential within the maximum potentiality of nature (energy in motion), and they key increase your potential to the potentiality offered is your comprehension. All possible information in existence is within energy; so you already perceive everything, but you lack comprehension of it, which requires adherence to the laws of nature.
               </p>
               <p>
                No matter where you are in your mental journey...you need to comprehend the laws of nature; the rules that define motion and thereby govern all within motion. The good news is that all conscious lifeforms instinctively (through the shared survival instinct)comprehend those rules (including us), but that our weakness of selfishness corrupted us so severely, that we not only ignore our instinctive command line of operations, but that we now have a (((parasite))) ruthlessly exploiting that weakness to the detriment of all.
               </p>
               <p>
                And just to be clear...the laws of nature have nothing to do with any religion.

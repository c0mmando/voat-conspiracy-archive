<p>Is it even the same person? </p>
<p>And what\'s with the eyebrows? Creepy. <a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.empireboobookitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Michelle-Carter-Eyebrows.jpg">https://i1.wp.com/www.empireboobookitty.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Michelle-Carter-Eyebrows.jpg</a></p>
<p>Is she suffering from mental illness? Or MK Ultra electroshock &quot;therapy&quot;? Maybe she\'s simply a psychopath? </p>
<p>Another thing I find interesting is that the article discussing her release states, &quot;She has been at the Women’s Center here since February, save for <strong>once month in the summer where she was in a different location but still in the custody of the sheriff’s office</strong>, sheriff’s spokesman Jonathan Darling said.&quot; <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/michelle-carter-released-from-jail/ar-BBZg0C5?ocid=spartanntp">https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/michelle-carter-released-from-jail/ar-BBZg0C5?ocid=spartanntp</a> (be sure to check out the photos in the article)</p>
<p>Where was she being held? Digging, I found an older article stating, \'&quot;Ms. Carter is still in custody of the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office but she is not currently at a corrections facility in Bristol County,” he said Friday in an email. “We will not be providing any more information on her whereabouts.”\' <a href="https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20190727/michelle-carter-has-been-moved-to-another-corrections-facility">https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20190727/michelle-carter-has-been-moved-to-another-corrections-facility</a></p>
<p>What? Sounds a tad suspicious to me. Maybe doctors and scientists were studying her? Was she undergoing MK Ultra programming? Maybe she was having trans surgery? The possibilities are endless. I kept digging...</p>
<p>Found an article that still didn\'t know where she was being kept, but also mentioned some eyebrow raising info. &quot;Carter is still in the custody of the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office even though the office declined to say where she is now. When Carter was brought to the facility, she was put inside a one-person, <strong>medical cell that was located on the men’s side of the jail</strong>, NBC10 reports.&quot;  
</p>
<p>What? Why did she need a medical cell? Are the medical cells always on the men\'s side of the prison? I\'d think they\'d have a medical cell in the men\'s side and another on the women\'s side. But I\'ve never been to a prison, so I wouldn\'t know. Anyone have any insight on this? </p>
<p>If she is transgendered, why is the media and the courts keeping it from the public? I thought the media loved putting transgenders all over the airwaves. </p>
<p>If Michelle is a man, did the boyfriend know? Is transgenderism and other LGBTQ issues part of the reason why he\'s dead? </p>
<p>Regardless, what is she going to do now that she\'s back in society? Maybe she really is a woman, but I can\'t imagine anyone being interested in dating it. Are the talk shows going to reach out? Maybe some celebs will support her like they did with the West Memphis Three. I wouldn\'t doubt if Hellywood wanted to make a movie about this reject of nature. </p>
<p>Anyway that\'s my breakdown. Thoughts? Have any facts to add? </p>
<p>If any anons can solve the mystery about where she was being kept over the summer, that would be awesome.</p>',

            Those are some bushy eyebrows. Could have been she plucked them before she went to jail, and didn't have tweezers to thin them out while locked up?

           <p>
            She does have some odd facial structure too.

             She’s too much of a narcissist to commit suicide herself (and she know’s she’s going to Hell when she dies), so the next best thing is to transition.
            </p>
            <p>
             Probably thinks transitioning makes a case that she’s mental, resulting in some sympathy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since everybody knows what kind of a “friend” she can be, hers might prove to be a lonely existance, so why not be a “him?”

            This child was used to groom our culture that any child can use suicide as a weapon, even after death.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe if a control freak used his own threat of suicide to submit and control another human then the suicidal maniac should be charged with human trafficking (theft of free will) and terrorist threat against self and others. Attempted suicide should be a capitol offense if the act was to terrorize or manufacture collateral damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless we want to add value suicide weapons and empower terrorist..

             I disagree. If someone you're dating is threatening to commit suicide for whatever reason, you have a responsibility to tell their family and/or the police, then break off all contact with the person.

             She decided to viciously egg him on and I don't think she's remorseful at all.

              Adults who can be talked into suicide can be talked into murder suicide just as easily.
             </p>
             <p>
              Egg rolling a suicidal manic is a civic duty if the collateral damage is retarded or in this case eliminated from the gene pool.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the bleeding hearts like you who reward or encourage suicidal manics that weaponized suicide is POWER. Ultimate power that any criminally insane can use to control others to their will.
             </p>
             <p>
              Assholes like you not only protect these fucking weapons of mass destruction, but you teach our own fucking children that suicide is a weapon of choice because they get their 15 minutes of fame. Fuck you!
             </p>
             <p>
              The girl was an idiot while the spurned boy friend was "friend zoned". He was the sore loser who brings up suicide as a leverage. Soon after the "sanitized" text messages got leaked they got pulled and replaced with even more censorship with the complete lead up locked behind a gag order. True, his penis size was discussed but he brought up suicide as an implied blackmail tool.
             </p>
             <p>
              She just demanded that he be truthful about his threats.
             </p>
             <p>
              Reporting this suicidal maniac would require giving the creep even more attention. This criminally insane soyboy did humanity a favor and you want to punish the victim of suicide Blackmail? You really are an asshole.

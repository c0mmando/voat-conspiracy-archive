            Interesting stuff! I've sen this in the past, but it's been a while. I particularly like the part near the end where he talks about solutions. So here's kind of what I got from that section of this interview:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Education - realizing you are at war, socially, culturally, politically (I think many folks who subscribe to this subverse are probably already familiar with the concept that there are people in positions of power and influence who are vehemently opposed to our individual interests)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Remoralization - making patriotism fashionable again. Not the blind nationalism, "my country right or wrong", but actual pride in and belief in the ideals and virtues the country is based upon such as individual liberty and the right to self-determination, and perhaps moreso a belief the
              <em>
               ability
              </em>
              to achieve success that Americans are so famous for.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Forcing those in power to stop supporting "communism", not through writing letters or passive means, but through actively leveraging our very real abilities as groups and individuals.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Now I'm not sure I know exactly what the threat of communism is. Maybe I have been subverted by this KGB programming, having been brought up in the 90s. I think the notion of providing everybody what they need to survive and flourish is a good one, but the idea of taking unjustly from people involuntarily is not a good one. Perhaps this man means something different when he says "communism" than what I am thinking of. I know back then communism was the scary boogeyman, and I have heard some other things in the past about actual legitimate infiltration crap that spooked me out. But is it about communism as an economic model, or is it more about the oligarchs who were behind soviet russia, the totalitarianism and loss of individual liberty under that system?
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps I need to do some more history reading to understand the context.

             I don't think its Communism because communism itself isn't inherently bad. The people at the top can become corrupt very easily in Communism, which is obviously bad. I think its greed and totalitarianism in general that are bad. Communism is just a wonderful platform for those awful things to flourish.

            Very mixed message - Communism/Socialism BAD, Capitalism BAD. He's right on so many points, but he didn't quite connect the dots - corporate power rules both extremes. I can hardly blame him, though, this was 30 years ago before the internet. We have learned a lot since then.

             I don't know that it is purely "corporate" power. I mean, there are people who are doing very bad things who don't necessarily (at least not visibly) tie in with corporations. Kissinger for example is a monster, but is he a corporate crony, or something else? I admit there are some terrible corporations that do really vile things in the name of profits, pharmaceutical companies, chemical companies, petroleum companies, etc. but is that all it is? Just profits and monetary greed? If that were so, then the federal reserve wouldn't have any reason to exert power since they can make money out of nothing. But it's got to be something more than just that... at least, I think?
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe I misunderstand the meaning of the phrase "corporate power" in this context.

            This whole thing has been completely mind-boggling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women are constantly asking to be seen as equals to all men, while simultaneously hating all men and working to tear them down. You can't be equal to someone you're stepping on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Axis has always been a comedian who is goofy, silly and sometimes odd. But to say he is a predator who sexually assaults women is laughable.
           </p>
           <p>
            SHE went to HIS home and got NAKED. And now she's pissed and hurt and whining because of what? Did he not like her enough so now she's insecure and lashing out? What were the specific non-verbal cues she gave out that explicitly showed how "truly uncomfortable" she was while she was NAKED and giving him ORAL SEX.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not a man... but I know men. And I'm sure any man who has a naked woman giving him oral sex will think he has the green light to play.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women- If you are uncomfortable with a situation then get your damn clothes on and LEAVE. Don't stick around and write a blog about it after the fact. Because any human who has been assaulted, and I mean, truly assaulted, knows how painful that situation is and the lingering effects it has and the last thing you're going to do is write a public blog about the experience.

            Oh. Come the fuck on. All this #metoo shit is fake as hell. Yall all go along with it because yall hate the accused. Problem is that YOU could be the accused next. All of these bullshit claims are another propaganda distraction bullshit and everyone keeps going along with condemning the accused without proof. What the FUCK happened to innocent until proven guilty?

             You were correct about sea turtles having Herpes, however. Humans can't catch it but you might pass it on to another turtle so be careful. Yalls.

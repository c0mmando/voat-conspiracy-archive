<p>When you consider the memories that are burned into your own brain, typically some will include traumatic experiences. From being bitten by a snake or dog as a child, to a car accident or witness of domestic abuse, some experiences stick with you. It’s the same reason why any member of an older generation can tell you exactly where they were when they heard John F Kennedy was shot. Or why everyone except late Millennials and Generation Z remember exactly how their day unfolded on September 11th.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, half of America has yet to reconcile one if not both of these days. Unlike being attacked by an animal, or hydroplaning into a guardrail, understanding cause and effect isn’t as simple with JFK and 911. To elaborate, Fran Shure, a twenty-year private practitioner of psychotherapy and licensed professional counselor succinctly explains:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxiQmtVGgcQ">“When we hear information that contradicts our world view, social psychologists call the resulting insecurity \'cognitive dissonance\'.</a> For example, with 9/11 we have one cognition which is what the official story of 9/11 is. What our government told us. What our media repeated to us over and over. That 19 Muslims attacked us. On the other hand we have what scientists, researchers, architects, engineers are now beginning to tell us which is that there is evidence that shows the official story cannot be true. So now we’ve lost our sense of security. We are starting to feel vulnerable. Now we’re confused.”</p>
<p>It’s for this reason 9/11 deniers are as pervasive as they are. Some emotional hurtles are too big for family members. For additional clarification and context, Ms. Shure provides an excellent analogy involving a dysfunctional family and the government:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLq9bEnGSn0">“Another lens through which we can understand our situation in our country is the model of the dysfunctional family.</a> So for example, in a dysfunctional family the parents abuse their children. The children on the other hand are dependent upon their parents. They need their parents for survival. They need to be loved by their parents. They need to feel that their parents are good. So in spite of what they hear with their own ears, see with their own eyes, they will cling to their belief that their parents are good people. Then when we grow up, as children grow up, we have the opportunity then often to look at our family situation more objectively. And to acknowledge the abuse and to choose to heal our self. Choose to raise our children in a different way. And if it’s appropriate we may hold our parents accountable. Hold them legally accountable. So just as with the individual family, it’s the same on the national level. <strong>We need the truth in order to heal.</strong> If we don’t want greater deceptions. If we don’t want more war based on these deceptions then we need to know the truth. And the way to find the truth is an investigation and holding those responsible legally accountable…It’s part of the healing process on the individual level and the collective level. We need the truth in order to heal.”</p>
<p>On this 16th anniversary of 9/11 - before we send our children to fight in a war they do not even remember the start of - let us <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A9-13&amp;version=NIV">pray</a> we can join our neighbors on the path of healing, restoration and truth.

            Sometimes you can

            know the truth, and ac
           </p>
           <p>
            I may never know the truth about 9/11.
           </p>
           <p>
            But let's be honest, the government is to blame regardless of whether they set it up, or let it happen.
           </p>
           <p>
            They either were complicit, ignorant or let it happen to push an agenda. Neither of which is good, and that is the truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            They failed in our minds either way, once we start understanding
            <em>
             that
            </em>
            truth as a person and nation it brings the same release, trust me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Going forward knowing that truth is better than running around in circles never going anywhere.

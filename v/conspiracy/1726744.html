            It's controlling the narrative. If you think another country is your enemy you won't pay attention to the problems at home, it also provides a global divide amongst people. The US wants Americans to see the Russians as evil because they overthrew their government, no different than how Britain has kept up a social antagonism with France. Why? Lady guillotine.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the people figured out their real enemy, and the West had its own purging of established elites we could end this once and for all.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're snakes. I think the lizard people thing is a metaphor if anything. France, Russia, China ended them, but they slowly worm their way back in. Russia is dirty dealing with American elites, just look at the Uranium One purchase.
           </p>
           <p>
            One country rising up does nothing, time passes and the lizards grow back.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need global electoral reform. Canada was promised it, but they back peddle because if the people's votes counted how they should it would look very different. The Green Party one year got enough votes for 8 seats in government, but only won 1 riding because of first past the post. So what the people want (right or wrong) isn't represented. They don't want it because their money loses power.
           </p>
           <p>
            They want Russia as the enemy because the war machines churn. The government will protect them, but from what? Russia isn't going to invade the US. So why are they the enemy? Because they could? No, it's a joke.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Millennium War games showed the US would struggle against an Israel sized country and certainly wouldn't win easily. Russia isn't nearly as strong.
           </p>
           <p>
            But do you think the rich want people learning about Trotsky and over throwing government?

<p>&quot;Just off a winding highway along the Pacific coast in Monterey, California, is a private clinic where people can pay $8,000 to have their veins pumped with blood plasma from teenagers and young adults.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jesse Karmazin is the entrepreneur who made the practice possible, by launching a clinical trial on the potential of “young blood” through his startup Ambrosia&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Over the last decade or so, such studies have offered provocative clues that certain hallmarks of aging can be reversed or accelerated when old mice get blood from young ones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wyss-Coray says the company’s initial funding was provided by a billionaire in Hong Kong who felt that a plasma transfusion had helped his grandfather combat Alzheimer’s. In March 2015, the plasma company Grifols invested $37.5 million in the startup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ambrosia’s trial is funded by participants rather than investors. “People want to believe that young blood restores youth, even though we don’t have evidence that it works in humans and we don’t understand the mechanism of how mice look younger,” Wyss-Coray says. “I think people are just attracted to it because of vampire stories.” He mentions a Hungarian tale of a wealthy woman who bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As of December 15, Karmazin says, Wright had infused 25 people with young blood. Karmazin claims his participants are seeing miraculous results; a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome, for example, “feels healthy for the first time” and “looks younger.” &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Conboy says despite that, many people are willing to avail themselves of questionable anti-aging remedies.&quot;</p>

            I've posted a couple of articles about this w little interest shown. But, it's huge. Where are the donors coming from?  That's a pretty lucrative price. Well maybe will save few lives, worth keeping the kids alive. Are there pedo connections to MIT?

             Thank you! The mods are hastily taking down everything to do with this topic. WTF? I smell a P. Thiel connection....

            <p>
             Anyhow, looking for pedos connected to MIT. In a related line of inquiry, how many MIT professors have been "suicided" of late...do you think?

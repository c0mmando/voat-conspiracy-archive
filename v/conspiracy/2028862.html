It's here also to demonstrate the motivation, and technical evolution of what would become chemtrails ('what else can we spray?').

               : Operation Dew refers to two separate field trials conducted by the United States in the 1950s. The tests were designed to study the behavior of aerosol-released biological agents.  Operation Dew took place from 1951-1952 off the southeast coast of the United States, including near Georgia, and North and South Carolina.[1][2] Operation Dew consisted of two sets of trials, Dew I and Dew II.  Operation Dew I consisted of five separate trials from March 26, 1952 until April 21, 1952 that were designed to test the feasibility of maintaining a large aerosol cloud [

               : Operation LAC (large area coverage) was a US army chemical corps operation that dispersed microscopic zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles over much of the United States.  The purpose was to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents.  Anecdotal evidence suggests there were adverse health effects--of course mitigated by US gov agency reports which are to be trusted always (911 NIST report, Warren report).  The wikipedia article continues, "the use of ZnCdS remains controversial and one critic accused the Army of "literally using the country as an experimental laboratory"".  This is solid proof of chemtrails and because of the widespread scope of the dispersal (most of US), chemtrail doubters such as topmind types have no leg to stand on anymore.

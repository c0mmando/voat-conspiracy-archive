            Just watch the video again.  All the evidence has been captured on film.  The two women, one in a red dress, one in a black, signals the operation to begin.  There was no sniper.  Watch.  The driver turns and shoots JFK.  Jackie, seeing this, attempts to leap out of the back of the car to get away from the man who just shot her husband point blank.  A second agent, positioned perfectly, jumps on the back of the car and flashes a weapon at Jackie, who then, terrified, slinks back into the car.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all right there, plain for anyone to see.  There was no sniper, no grassy knoll, no second shooter.  There was only the driver who shot.  It's plain as day if you watch the video.
           </p>

            Edit: link to stabilized and slowed video.

            What I've always wondered about this assassination: why isn't there any film from media organizations present at the scene? JFK was making a public appearance, there were crowds, wasn't there media? If not, why not? And if so, where is their footage?

               <p>
                How about the CCTV footage captured by the newly installed "high tech security camera system" of Adam Lanza Shooting through the allegedly newly installed bullet proof window at the front entrance to Sandy Hook Elementary, which showed no signs of being used for over a year and had visible signs of flood damage and mold/mildew growth at the base of the walls, with an AR15 that the coroner stated on camera was the primary weapon used to kill all the victims but that the police reported was found in the trunk of a car that wasn't registered to anyone in the Lanza family (a family which residents of Sandy Hook had no interaction with), but that footage on the scene showed was a pump action shotgun?

                 <p>
                  I've done a hell of a lot more than "a minuscule amount of research", I read the coroners report, I've read every line of the police report, I've looked at all the crime scene photos I could find, I've watched every interview of supposed witnesses and family members, I've scoured helicopter footage, news articles, "live" and not live media coverage, you name it I've probably seen it, and guess what I found.. zero evidence supporting the official story. Yup, zero. In fact, I have found zero evidence supporting that anyone died that day at that school, or that even a single bullet was ever fired, or that that school was even operational at that time. NOTHING.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I went into this research with the objective of debunking the conspiracy theorists, thinking that it would be a piece of cake to find enough evidence to support the story I was told by the news and by the government (which at the time I took at face value), but boy was I in for adventure. Zero witnesses, zero evidence, conflicting accounts of what happened, and endless amounts of BS media shenanigans.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If you think I'm wrong, then you simply haven't even tried to look for the truth with regards to Sandy Hook and what did happen or, more importantly, what didn't happen.

                   Zero witnesses? Zero evidence? The fuck are you smoking? Stop drinking the conspiratard koolaid for a second. Dude it was on live TV, scumbag reporters were sticking microphones in the face of crying kids. I remember it clearly.

                  <p>
                   The point of the camera is to see who's at the door. Why would there ever be a need to invest in a hard drive? It's not a gas station in the ghetto where it'd be used in solving crimes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Not to mention no gun control passed nationwide because of it. And only a few restrictions happened in CT.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Read the police report, the killer's DNA was conclusively found on the gun. Check out Page 19 -

                   I don't even get morons like you. It's not like he used lasers or destroyed skyscrapers. Some asshole used a gun to kill people, it happens frequently in America. What's so weird about it? Obama didn't take away guns, nothing came of it aside from a bunch of families being torn apart and then having to deal with the bullshit media.

                      The east coast is not very appealing despite how white it is. For the record, I just want to live some place that has low crime, specifically low violent crime. And the data is clear, the higher the black population percentage in an area, the higher the rate of violent crime. Do you wish to dispute this?

                       Black people are generally more poor. Poor people commit more crime. If you have a higher concentration, you have a higher crime rate.

                        The east coast, to which I have been many times, is too liberal, too crowded, and generally not a place I'm interested in living. Also, too much gun control.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Poverty does not cause crime. I know you want it to so that you don't have to connect crime rates to the entitlement culture fostered by liberal do-gooder policies, but it doesn't. More than any other factor though, it is the criminalizion of self-defense by means of gun control that promotes violent crime. Also, the connection between blacks and crime is undeniable, even when the criminals are not poor.

                         You know that? That sounds like another assumption from you. Democratic hand out policies are so damaging and wasteful. I've seen it first hand over and over again. The welfare state has a hand in the destruction of the family which creates more reliance on the state.

                      Sigh... these are nice stories and all, but that's all they are, stories, they are not evidence.

                      Ok, the woman from the first link did not actually see the shooter, did she? She says she think she may have walked past the shooter in the parking lot, but that is not a positive ID, is it? Then later, she claims she was hiding in a room that the shooter looked inside, but then left. I've seen her interview, she says she saw the shooters boots, also not a positive ID. Therefore, she is not a witness.

                      Page 19 of that forensic document that you linked is discussing DNA taken from a Savage Mark II 22. bolt action rifle that was

                      </a>
                      , not at the school. So this is irrelevant. However, what is very interesting to note is that the DNA sampled from the rifle did not match Lanza and the DNA from the .22 caliber cartridge found with the rifle was matched to "convicted offender DNA".
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This report claims that DNA found on the Bushmaster AR15 is a

                       possible

                      match with Adam Lanza, but that gun was said to have been found in the trunk of Lanza's car. So even if it did have his DNA, why would this matter if it wasn't used to kill anyone? Reports from "federal officials" at the time were that the AR15 was left in the car, only later did the story change to suit the anti-gun agenda.

                       You believe that nonsense about crisis actors or something? I can't even fathom the level of stupid required to think that. According to Wikipedia, not only is the town 95% white and is hardly a populous city. Not to mention the median income is 6 figures. Who would pay to keep everyone quiet? It literally makes no sense to think it was fake. Gun violence is common and not difficult to do, look at all the uneducated inner city gangsters who kill each other all the time.

                       The story wasn't changed for an anti-gun agenda. It was changed because it was a traumatic event with constant conflicting stories from the ravenous media hounds. The AR15 was used for the killing which is why the state banned it. The shotgun was in the trunk. Possible match? 7 billion to 1 odds is just a possibility?

                        I know that media coverage does not equal proof. In fact, that is pretty much my entire point, that the media has been lying to us, but also that the government and police departments involved in this shooting (and several others) have also been lying. What I am saying is all this is most likely just a fake story being used to push a gun control agenda. They did try to ram through more gun control immediately after this, right? It just didn't work on a national scale. They are of course still trying.

                        hired by the media to help fake stories or to at least embellish them when the media doesn't have enough to work with. They are also hired by the government to act as victims and witness during drills. And Sandy Hook does appear to be a drill that "went live".

                        California has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. I'd say she has been fairly successful considering that

                        I can't really answer this, but my guess is that some "families" were used as front runners because of their "superior" bullshitting skills. If you watch the interviews closely, you can see that many of the "family members" have a very hard time keeping it together. I don't mean they were prone to crying, in fact not a single one shed an actual tear on camera, I mean some of them had trouble not laughing.

                        We were
                        <em>

                        </em>
                        that a crazy guy shot his mother and a bunch of kids in a school. The federal government tried to pass national gun control and failed because, shockingly, gun control is very unpopular. The controls passes in CT and CO, while seemingly minimal, are still a step in the direction of complete gun control. The agenda has always been to seek a complete ban on firearms, but getting there incrementally would work just fine.

                        It's not that is it "unfathomable", it's that there is a ridiculous lack of evidence combined with obviously false testimonies from "family", "teachers", and neighbors, and conflicting accounts of what happened.

                        They had The Patriot Act ready to go
                        <em>

                        911. It is unlikely they could have had a document that long and complex drafted in the 8 days between the attacks and when it was introduced to congress. Government is not capable of such efficiency.

                         Lop you are an idiot. Fake story? It's not even logical in any sense that it could be faked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The picture I posted says at point 4 that it's 7 billion to 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So all the media, cops, all the rich residents that live there are all in on it? And of course you have no proof because that's literally insane to believe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         People smiling is proof of nothing. People respond to tragedy differently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         So government isn't efficient but they can fake something on this scale for 3 years and your ONLY "proof" is some smiling people in a video?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Your claims the media faked it are so asinine I can't even comprehend it. The fact you think it's all a ruse is asinine. You have no proof and all speculation, none of which even makes sense. Funny how you claim a lack of evidence as you not only ignore it but fail to provide your own. "They are also hired by the government to act as victims and witness during drills." - extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I don't agree with you because you're an idiot who believes the moon is made of cheese.

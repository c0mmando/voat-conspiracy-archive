            Why do people think they need to go to church? Do they somehow believe that because someone puts on fancy robes that makes them closer to god? You can read the KJV yourself. "It's about the community." A community of what? Cowards and charlatans?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want something done right you have to do it yourself. Learn things on your own, don't rely on an "authority".

               I believe you are correct. The machine requires compliance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Dr. Greg Dixon - 30 Ways IRS Controls Preachers Through 501c3
              </p>
              <p>
               1). The church must have a "distinct legal existence:" According to IRS publication #557 that legal existence would date from incorporation, pg. 3. Therefore, a church must be incorporated or it cannot be called a church.
              </p>
              <p>
               2). The church must admit that it exists by a privilege granted by the IRS (tax‑exempt), rather than by RIGHT, as granted by God through the Holy Scriptures (non‑taxable);  the latter of which is recognized and guaranteed autonomy by the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, 1st Amendment. The church must thereby recognize another as Head, the State, as opposed to the true Head, which is God.
              </p>
              <p>
               3). The church must have a "recognized creed and form of worship." The IRS must approve (recognize) the creed (belief) and form (manner) of worship.
              </p>
              <p>
               4). The church must have a "definite and distinct ecclesiastical government." That is, the church must be ruled in the form of a hierarchy or hierarchical (as is found in many so‑called main stream churches –e.g., Catholic, Methodist. etc.), and not individually ruled by the local church's ministry (pastor/leader) and/or congregation (as in Baptist, Christian‑Israel, James Lloyd or Christian Media Ministries or some other autonomous‑type of church/ministry/movement).
              </p>
              <p>
               5). The church must have a "formal code of doctrine and discipline," as in some churches who have established "doctrines" or "traditions of men," as opposed to those Christians whose churches/groups/ministries have established their faith, practices and doctrines solely from the Holy Scriptures. Unfortunately, many of the 501(c)3 churches have established doctrine/traditions that are not in accordance with the WORD of God.
              </p>
              <p>
               6). The church must have a "distinct religious history" that is denominational – e.g. Catholic, as opposed to being "autonomous" or serving its congregation as an "independently acting, Bible‑oriented, body of believers."
              </p>
              <p>
               7). The church must be structured as an "organization." Again, this is modeled after the Catholic church‑type organization, not the autonomous‑type of church – e.g. Baptist.
              </p>
              <p>
               8). The church must be an "organization of ordained ministers." The local Baptist church approves its own ministers, many of whom could be laymen, such as Charles Haddon Spurgeon and the late G. B. Vick – men "ordained of God," as opposed to men that are ordained and licensed by institutions, state or religious.
              </p>
              <p>
               9). The church must have these ordained ministers who are "selected after completing prescribed courses of study". Again, Catholic‑style, not Baptist. Like the Apostles, who had only "been with Jesus" (taught and ordained by him to serve His kingdom), local autonomous churches many times approve pastors who have not received any formalized institutional religious training – but are ordained of God because of their Faith, Practice, Study, and Example.
              </p>
              <p>
               10). The church must have "established places of worship." Many churches, ministries, groups have no permanent address or facility (place of worship ‑ some meet in parks or other scenic places, some have only radio facilities) for a variety of reasons (because they are circuit preachers, because of persecution, because of their type of ministry, etc., they move from place to place or have no congregation meeting facility per se).
              </p>
              <p>
               11). The church must submit to the IRS by paying a "user fee" (tribute) for tax‑exempt status. This is contrary to the Scriptures, the U.S. Constitution and all the State Constitutions.
              </p>
              <p>
               12). The church must be engaged in activities that further "exclusively Public purposes, rather than Private interests." The true church of Christ exists for the Personal and Private interest of Christ and His Elect, and not the State.
              </p>
              <p>
               13). The church must answer to the IRS as to its "daily activities."
              </p>
              <p>
               14). The IRS dictates its control over all financial activities of the church – including sources of income, donors of $100.00 or more, and expenditures.
              </p>
              <p>
               15). The church may not use cash, or it will be suspected of "money laundering." All books and records must be made available for IRS inspection at all times.
              </p>
              <p>
               16). The church must serve the IRS in the capacity of "informer" – by reporting a history of who serves in the various jobs within the church – e.g. Pastors, associates, counselors, directors, teachers, office/clerical/maintenance personnel.
              </p>
              <p>
               17). The church must inform the IRS who it is that receives charitable help from the church.
              </p>
              <p>
               18). The church must inform the IRS about "love gifts and offerings" in excess of $600.00 given to evangelists and missionaries, by filing a Form 1099 on each recipient, including on those who are regularly supported.
              </p>
              <p>
               19). The church must use only IRS approved methods of fund raising.
              </p>
              <p>
               20). The pastor of the church must not preach against the U.S. tax system, or say anything against the practices and tactics of the IRS.
              </p>
              <p>
               21). The pastor of the church must answer to the IRS and give unlimited submission to the civil magistrate pertaining to all laws – federal, state and local, including "Public Policy."
              </p>
              <p>
               22). The pastor of the church must advocate, promote, and actively encourage race mixing (interracial marriage), which is in violation of the "kind after kind" standard established by God at the creation, if the church has an educational ministry.
              </p>
              <p>
               23). The pastor of the church cannot influence legislation concerning the licensing of church ministries.
              </p>
              <p>
               24). The pastor of the church cannot promote or engage in any political activity that opposes pornography.
              </p>
              <p>
               25). The pastor of the church cannot actively support legislation that declares that children belong to their parents as opposed to the authority of the state.
              </p>
              <p>
               26). The pastor of the church cannot actively support legislation that opposes a state’s lottery or other "legalized" gambling pursuits.
              </p>
              <p>
               27). The pastor of the church cannot advocate support of the concept that the U.S. or state Constitutions are the Supreme Law of the Land or the various states, respectively.
              </p>
              <p>
               28). The pastor of the church cannot actively participate in any activity that is in opposition to the public school system.
              </p>
              <p>
               29). The pastor of the church can make no public declaration that the church congregation is to obey God and not the government, even if the government’s stand is in violation of God’s laws, commandments, statutes, and judgments.
              </p>
              <p>
               30). The pastor of the church cannot oppose laws that are in support of or legalize "sodomy" – which is in direct conflict with the Word of God.

             Because Christ was antisemitic. His arrival (literal or literary) was the moment all good/real Jews were to convert to Christians in accordance with the will of God. Those who are Jewish today are those who rejected the Christian God, thus making them anti-Christ, the children of the devil, the Synagogue of Satan.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can imagine why these people do not want a revival of Christ's teachings after all the hard work they put into regaining the power they held over gentile masses with Catholicism by perverting Christianity with their "Judeo-Christian" deception in the last century to breed a loyal goyim army of cash cows and cannon fodder. As is, the founding lie that created Judeo-Christians (that Jesus was a Jew) is getting hard enough to protect with nothing but cries of antisemitism! It's not like it has any actual proof to support it, biblical or historical. Just the "the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.". Any real Christian would be familiar with what the Bible has to say about them (John 8:44, Rev 2:9 &amp; 3:9). The question is, how many real Christians are left? I'd wager most of them are in Eastern Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you were to go back even just 100 years and tell our great grandparents' generation that Jesus was a Jew, they'd laugh you right out of the pews. Antisemitism was widespread prior to WWII. Socially, politically and religiously. Sometimes that's hard to grasp from the inside of this sheltered and programmed era of political correctness. Almost everyone these days, Christians included, has this incredibly arrogant tendency to view themselves as the first 'enlightened' generation of mankind. Because of this they tend to dismiss all of the politically incorrect views and beliefs of past generations as ignorant bigotry, rather than the wisdom it actually was.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://russia-insider.com/en/serious-academic-antisemitism-enjoying-revival-responding-new-realities/ri24755">
              This would be a good resource for more about that history.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             From a purely historical standpoint, I speculate that Catholicism was a Jewish control scheme, at some point some clever gentiles/repentant Jews succeeded in overthrowing it's Jew worship dogma with the creation and widespread adoption of the New Testament and it's rather overtly antisemitic central figure, Jesus Christ. Then, over the last several decades, Jews regained control through the post-war suppression of antisemitism and the advent of Judeo-Christianity. And, to that end, it makes sense that they'd be desperate to leverage any power they have at stifling any second comings of Christ. It'd be the final nail in the coffin for them in the age of information.

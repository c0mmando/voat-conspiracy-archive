', "Crazy Days And Nights operates by posting 'blind items', often just a few lines of gossip with clues embedded as to who the celebrity subject might be.", "It is then up to the readers, who Enty Lawyer described in a Vanity Fair interview in 2016 as 'exceptionally smart', to deduce who might be involved."

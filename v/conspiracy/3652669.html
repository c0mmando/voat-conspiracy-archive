<p>Direct pain in the body around the clock that tends to get worse and more severe due to ICT-Implants or other kind of transmitting devices, often labeled by Targeted Individuals as non-lethal weapons, Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs), Electromagnetic Frequency (EMF) or simply radiation.</p>
<p>Pain in the spinal cord or back, lethargic and aching pains.</p>
<p>Pain in the back of the head (Cerebellum) or various regions responsible for memory and imagination.</p>
<p>Pain in the “amygdala” or the limbic system. Pain in the forehead or frontal lobe (induces scattered or slurred speech).</p>
<p>“Cooked” brain (slight heating of the brain or Hypothalamus to induce synthetic emotional states or stress disorders (ELF waves can also cause depression or stress tuned at  6.6Hz).</p>
<p>Electroshocks in the brain, Zaps and mild shocks; Involuntary body movements caused by nervous system shocks and attacks.</p>
<p>Pain in the chest, Palpitations and Adrenal rushes.</p>
<p>Toothache, gum bleeding and pain in gums or teeth or in Jaw and glandular regions.</p>
<p>“Mild Heart attacks” or slowed heart beats, panic attacks and chronic anxiety and fast paced heart beats.</p>
<p>Pain in vital organs: liver, stomach, heart, lungs, eyes, genitals amongst other places</p>
<p>Itching eyes – leading to tears and red eyes, beams alike a pin prick or irritation.</p>
<p>Food is poisoned, contamination by evil Perps in food stores or restaurants etc..</p>
<p>Air around your nostrils  heated or lacking oxygen.</p>
<p>Electronic sexual “rapes” during sleep or while awake, probably with ICT-implants, unnatural genital stimulation or swelling.</p>
<p>Hypnotic trigger words</p>
<p>Can mimic any of the above symptoms: radiation, pain, bad tastes, head aches, and so on or trigger unbearable fatigue.</p>
<p>The trigger words come in whole sequences, like they were taken out of a dictionary with all symptoms and all words that sound alike or similar.</p>
<p>While some trigger words have effects on the mind and body, other’s have emotional effects only (sensitisation of the Targeted individual to certain words, that trigger negative emotions, like disgust, fear, anger).</p>
<p>The trigger words are sometimes reinforced through dark NLP and gang stalking.</p>
<p>Trigger words are in the beginning very difficult to discover because they are coupled with the TI\'s routines.</p>
<p>The brain can’t differentiate always between what it is made to believe and what really happens.</p>
<p>Once discovered, they are “released”; becoming aware of the “truth” wins over the lie that the mind has been told.</p>
<p>When they are discovered, new trigger words will be programmed into the subconscious.</p>

<p>Loud synthetic telepathy. The attackers talk with some of the victims 24/7. They use interrogation techniques that are only used in the CIA or secret service. That is labeled also V2K (voice to skull, or loud synthetic telepathy). A learning computer with a synthetic voice that can be modulated in any voice, can take over partially or full time, after the initial stages. This keeps the victim awaken and always tired.</p>
<p>Silent synthetic telepathy. The victim doesn’t hear the attackers but there is thought manipulation, directing their attention. The communication is experience as &quot;thoughts&quot;.

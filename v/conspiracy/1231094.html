            Pars Gas Field. Very important for future energy needs. A lot of what's happening in Syria is related to this.

            There could be something to that. We often tend to see people who have different motivations from ourselves as being either idiotic or evil. However, a more accurate truth is that everyone has very real reasons for their behavior.

            Merkel is a head of state. She wouldn't be there if she were stupid, and more often than not, sane people often act for goals that they perceive as beneficial in some way. Even Hitler was motivated by elevation of the German people and state. Perhaps there are motivations that can't be revealed, but she's in a tough situation and has to act despite strong public disapproval.

             Hitler didn't allow his citizens to get raped in the street and call them racists for defending themselves, he actually cared for his people. Merkel is nothing more than a German Hillary.

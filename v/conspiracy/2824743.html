<p>Police captain who introduced new City of Las Vegas gunshot detection technology last October remains silent, no new details
LAS VEGAS (INTELLIHUB) — The Las Vegas Metro Police Department captain that went missing at 2 a.m. on Dec. 21, 2017, was the same captain that introduced the city’s new ShotSpotter gunshot detection program on Oct. 16, 2017, just two-weeks after the Oct. 1 Harvest Music Festival massacre.</p>
<p>LVMPD Capt. James LaRochelle went missing in the wee hours on Dec. 21, 2017, but was located later the same day by authorities who offered little to no explanation about the captain’s disappearance and reemergence.</p>
<p>According to a Facebook group emergency incident administrator named Mikey Slyman, on Dec. 21 the LVMPD put out a “BOLO” or a “missing persons” report and broadcast the AWOL police captain’s name, his physical description, and the description of his vehicle many times throughout the day which Slyman thought was out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“They kept broadcasting this person all through the day,” he said. “So finally one of the guys in my group said ‘I’m going to look his name up because they are really concerned about this missing person.\'”</p>
<p>That’s when Slyman said he and another person realized that LaRochelle was an LVMPD captain and that he went missing with “a bunch of guns.”</p>
<p>In fact, authorities were so worried about the whereabouts of Rochelle that they even broadcast the BOLO in Arizona.</p>
<p>Moreover, Capt. Rochelle was instrumental in the public roll-out and announcement of the city’s new 1-year-long gunshot detection pilot program which uses ShotSpotter technology to pinpoint gunshots within seconds of discharge.</p>
<p>It’s a very odd and very fishy situation.</p>
<p>We need to find out more about who this James LaRochelle really is.</p>
<p>Were the guns evidence? Maybe Paddocks? Maybe the polices weapons used that night by the police to mow down people? Can we find out what weapons James LaRochelle took with him when he went missing? Where was captain James LaRochelle on the night of October 1st 2017? Get digging now anons. I\'m sure James LaRochelle has something to do with Timothy J Bates and Scott Edminston. James LaRochelle\'s ties to Arizona beg further questioning and investigating. And possible ties to New Mexico as well. There was a green folder in Paddocks room in 32-135 or 32-134 on a bed i wish we could know what was in it.</p>
<p>And there was a sliver case in Paddocks room right next to the bar looking island with a AR with a 60 round coffin magazine on a barstool positioned like it was there to guard what ever was in the silver case if need be. What was in the silver case in room 32-135? Technology? Weapons? Bombs? Live animals? Drugs? Human/Animal organs? What was the green folder about what was in there?</p>
<p>Was the green folder some sort of dirt like a dossier form an intelligence agency? Does the VIP being escorted out of Tropicana and his case have something to do with Stephen Paddock? What did the police steal out of Paddocks home? Guns or hard drives? How come police or feds or spies are breaking into Paddock house and removing evidence and a police captain went missing with guns? What are they disposing of and hiding? Arizona and the ATF have a roll in this i\'m sure and therefor Fast &amp; Furious as well and the gun Skipper sold to Paddock as well. The Bundy standoff is connected to Las Vegas shooting somehow. Remember Marilou Danley is a fed and Eric Paddock has to have been involved as well i\'m sure his white RV was in Las Vegas on October 1 2017 it had to have been. Find the white RV that police described a elderly white male shooter in combat fatigues going into near the Tropicana and Motel 6 that forced them to put a shotgun to a white RV\'s window and scan for a shooter. When you find what exact RV they were talking about and had to scan when you find it try to see if it\'s anything like Eric Paddocks white RV. There was a internet forum and communication on there from Eric Paddocks account about taking a white RV to Vegas for a trip and loading it up with motor bikes but i cant fucking find it. It\'s really hard to find but i saw it on the chans before so ask the chans how they got a hold of that post in a forum.</p>
<p>Marilou Danley worked with Brian Hodge before in Australia in the same casino. Brian said something about cops chasing a security guard in yellow and shooting him on the 32 floor. Another Australian women witness saw cops chasing a security guard in yellow through a hotel and casino lobby and some other witnesses said they saw i think it was the same guard turn and fire at police in that same hotel but i\'m not sure it could\'ve been at another hotel with another security guard shooting at cops. Philippines earlier last year had a casino or casinos getting hit by ISIS and all through out last year in Vegas there was a massive increase in shootings at casinos and hotels in the Vegas area before the shooting in Vegas on the 1st of October so i think the shootings fit with ISIS or it was some one doing a test run for the October 1 2017 Vegas shooting. The weapons the police captain had could\'ve been used in Philippines or in Vegas before the 10/1/2017 massacre at various casinos earlier in the year trying to test a police response time before doing a bigger shooting or mission like the one that happened at the Mandalay Bay and Route 91 harvest festival.</p>',

            We need an investigation into the LVPD and FBI for their investigation/cover up of the shooting. Based on A dozen dead witnesses, more then likely murdered by FBI/CIA/LVPD, a police captain goes missing with weapons from the Las Vegas shooting, police break into Paddocks home while it's under police surveillance and steal evidence, airport jet fuel tanks shot at by cops, windows in Paddocks room weren't broken until police shot the windows out, reports of shootings and massacre all around the Vegas strip that go unreported and covered up, multiple witnesses who saw police helicopter gunships firing on the strip and killing innocent civilians and multiple shooters killing innocent civilians have been murdered by cops, warnings posted to 4chan weeks before the shooting, a lie that this was a failed gun sting and Saudi assassination, warnings on 4chan before the Texas church shooting saying FBI would be the killers, many evidence and witnesses saying the cops shot up the Parkland high school, a cop busted for trying to assassinate the president, many viral videos showing out of control murderer criminal cops, videos from Parkland and Vegas shootings not being released to the public to clear the cops names now that they're suspects, you know what i think? I think we need an investigation into the LVPD and FBI. We need the whole country to demand all footage from Parkland and Las Vegas shootings be released so we don't think our own cops are suspects anymore. What say we get a hashtag going and demand all footage be released now? #copshavestartedtogenocideAmericans. We need to have an outside source come in and investigate the FBI and LVPD.

            Remember that all mafia own the police through bribes and probably surveillance i mean with money and today's technology plus in the case of Las Vegas with all the CCTV surveillance it's not impossible that the mafia could have serious black mail ability. So what? Mobsters become informants to get immunity and so they can do what they like and get away with it? The mafia has assimilated ideas from the FBI and has infiltrated the FBI. They allowed the FBI to absorb them. They can snitch on bad cops and their own mobsters if need be. Cops they bribed to do bad things and look the other way. They then have full immunity and protection as FBI informants.

            Las Vegas has lot of mafia and Donald Trump his some um history with the mafia and casino business. Adnan Khashoggi, Al-Waleed bin Talal, Mohammad Bin Salman, Jamal Khashoggi, and the Nabila and Khashoggi A's private jet, and Donald Trump are somehow mixed up in this Las Vegas shooting. And i think mafia as well. It's Vegas after all. I swear Donald Trump was an FBI informant/mobster or still is a FBI informant/mobster. He could still be both or one or the other.

            I wonder what with all that is happening is if this going to turn into Goodfellas and The Sopranos. I wonder if the Paddocks ever went upstate or had connections up state. We Godfather now? Sure Jamal Khashoggi was going to snitch Saudis in Vegas massacre and Whitey was going to snitch and rat Paddocks are FBI informants and Irish mafia. Sure Comey and Mueller work with the mob not against. I'm sure we need to look in to the New York mob and all the way up near New Jersey, New York city, and Boston.

            I think the Paddocks were pure Irish blood right? Boston? Whitey Bulger? Did the Paddocks father and them the three sons know Whitey Bulger and Mueller? Was Whitey Bulger killed because of his nick name "Whitey" as a fuck you to white people? Bulger + Mueller = Bueller. Ferris Bueller's Day Off symbolism, references, connections? Was Whitey going to snitch on another James? James Comey? Was he going to rat the Paddocks, Comey, and Mueller?

            Well we think now the cops shot out the windows after the shooting and staged the crime scene and leaked the photos to 4chan to solidify their lone gunman narrative. The cops also shot the aviation fuel tanks it was the cops who shot the tanks after the shooting. I think Paddock had a fucking bomb i think the silver case meant to blow up the room while he ran out down the building and the car bomb his car bomb was meant to blow up and kill as many innocent people as possible and damage the Luxor i think he wanted to light the buildings on fire and burn them.

            I think if i recall i remember seeing many 60 round coffin magazines for the AR guarding the silver case on top of the bar island counter so i think they were meant for use with the AR and the AR was not meant to shoot up the festival it was meant to guard the silver case. What could be that important to guard you need many 60 round coffin magazines to guard it? It's like he set the room up with some weapons to do the killing and others to guard the room from something maybe the police maybe not the police. Was his escape plan in the silver case? Tanerite and ammonium nitrate? Or a parachute and hang glider? A harpoon zip line?

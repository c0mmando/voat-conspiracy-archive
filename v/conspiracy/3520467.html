   The genocide of American Indians by Europeans is one of the most wild conspiracy theories I've heard. Not only aren't there any known dots to connect, but conspiracy theorists have to CREATE the dots.

          <p>
           <p>
            The true history of America.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first settlers of America preceded Indians by many thousands of years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The people we know as Indians disposed them of their land ..stole their land... as they likely migrated from Asia.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people found the ancient stone works built by others  and became Aztecs and Mayans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aztecs killed and enslaved Mayans until the Spanish came and turned the Mayans against the Aztecs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then disease killed most of both. Spanish kept the Indian custom of slavery and breed with the few remainders.  Most of today's Hispanics are much more descendents of the Spanish who killed off the Indians. They are the killers not the victims. Eva longoria and Jessica alba famously found this out in their public genetic test reveals.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are very few pockets of actual Aztecs and Mayans left.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus the killer Hispanics must pay reparations if anyone does
           </p>
           <p>
            The english came into north America over 100 years later where the Indians were now scarce and the land mostly empty. The Indians still practiced raiding and barbarity amongs neighboring tribes  although few remained.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know from english company records who funded tue colonists that colonists were specifically told not to kill Indians but to sell the corporate goods to them and trade with them for profit to the company.
           </p>
           <p>
            None the less the Indians killed most colonists or they died from the winters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally when english colonists established a foothold they traded successfully with Indians who retained slaves and even kept black slaves and profited immensely from english trading. Many Indians went to England and returned with the language and became major entrepreneurs.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the colonists fought for their freedom from Britain a hundred year later in 1776 many of the Indians were paid by the British and fought against the colonists. They were enemy combatants. They captured colonists and took them to British commonwealth of Canada and sold them to the British as prisoners of war.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thus Indians chose the wrong side.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the colonists won their freedom from England the first thing they did was create a constitution which began the abolition of slavery immediately by incorporating a clause that would forbid the importation of any new slaves from Africa in 25 yrs. This was done because of the english protestants religious beliefs.
           </p>
           <p>
            This began human rights as we no it and a refutation of the native Indian ways of murder and slavery.
           </p>
           <p>
            When gold was discovered in Georgia, wealthy Indians were paid for their land to move to Oklahoma. As always their were some who owned everything and agreed for others who owned no land but lived at the mercy of the rich Indians. The wealthy Indians. ..and there were many as they had become successful traders and plantation owners themselves... literally used their black slaves to pack and carry their bags on their carriages to move to Oklahoma and elsewhere. Of course the poor Indians who had nothing suffered in the move as they always do and this is all you hear about in the so called trail of tears. You don't hear about the rich Indian millionaires who were paid and had their black slaves move them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Religious protestants continued to attempt to end slavery while Indians and even freed black men had slaves. This of course was a continuation of the African tradition of enslaving other tribes.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the civil war Lincoln could not free the slaves on Indian territory because they were technically separate nations so the Indians were the last group to have black slaves in America.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the truth is english colonosts have a history of doing nothing but ending slavery and barbarity among the American Indians and African.
           </p>
           <p>
            While in Africa and among American Indians slavery continued.

            If genocide was the intent of Europeans in the new world, we did a shitty job of it. Who do you think the 55 million legal and 25 million illegal "Latinx" invaders from Mexico and Central America are? They
            <strong>
             <em>
              are
             </em>

            the so-called genocided indians.
           </p>
           <p>
            You know how their men like to dismember and eat each other in turf wars? Ever see a video of them hacking the heads off their captives and posting it on the internet? The so-called noble savage of the American plains were (and are) the same as their descendants. Tattooed brutes like your typical MS13 tribal fuck heads.

            Disease did most of the work. To say otherwise is fake and gay. Americans forced Indians off the lands they inhabited through demographic pressure that was sometimes violent. To say otherwise is fake and gay. The Indians were stone-age people who were sometimes cannibals and almost universally ritual torturers. The Americans used dirty tricks to win the fight against the Indians. I'll take all your downvotes now, thank you.

             North America is 3.5 million square miles of land. To put this in perspective population density was far lower than 1 person per square mile. When European settlers arrived in the area that became Ohio it was almost completely uninhabited so that you could travel across the entire state without seeing a single Indian. At least three distinct tribal cultures existed in Ohio over thousands of years and successively perished centuries before Columbus.

            It was never "one genocide" but a series of things. The problem is that everyone believed that those tribes had been around for thousands of years until the white man showed up, that was not the case. Tribes rose and fell all the time.

           <p>
            They leave out alot of details: how it was just one Guy who helped the pilgrims, his tribe was dead when they got there so they stayed. The tribes that helped the pioneers get across the west, the tribes that helped the colonists, and the tribes that avoided the trail of tears.

            Whole damn thing is complicated. I don't know if there is some evil truth suppressing conspiracy, or if the average person just does not have the smarts and patience to learn it all.

             i'm definitely not watching that, and neither should anyone else. I've seen some of that guy's videos and the ones i saw made him look like a guilty white liberal pseudointellectual. also, i don't care about that topic, and the culmination of such a thought in someone's mind makes me want to double down on avoiding hearing that person's thoughts

              After watching the video, I think youre right about that guy. Most of the video is probably accurate but at one point he says something like, 'in the game of civilization, the players dont matter, only the map.' Basically saying that europeans had easier animals to domesticate, allowing us to advance more easily. He thinks modern cows are the same animal that was domesticated, unlike the bison which would be too dangerous to yoke a plow to.

               (is long) talks about the cow vs bison thing really well, and the absolutely idiotic (not even using that word hyperbolically) premise that ONLY land matters. You'll probably be left laughing at how badly the narrator uses simple logic to completely bypass the "incidentally" jewish author's "arguments". not kidding the author is jewish and he's talking all this nonsense. I'll save the juicy bits for you to listen to in the video because the delivery in there is accidentally humorous and the whole thing is put together as well as I could do or want.

               i backed up that fucker's youtube channel because of his consistent home run swings with delivery and my style of articulation.

               funny you mention that book, i was going to link this comment to the video above. that book is written by a complete retard. I think i might have written something as bad as him when i was in 6th grade or something, maaaaybe 8th grade even, but going on 9th and 10th my teachers were good enough to get me to get my own head out of my ass had it been that far up there.

               I'm still having difficulties understanding HOW they didn't come up with the wheel. They say there were those toys, but what's the story on those toys? Were they absolutely confirmed to be real? And if so, were they confirmed to be played with where the wheel carried the ostensible vehicle chassis? or did they just have something that looked like wheels... ?? i don't really know the question to ask here since i can't figure a way they didn't make the connection of how to utilize it. any source material on that?

               It's the same with the Germs and Steel ploy of native Americans not having cereal crops like Europe, yet potato and maize crops are now an entrenched staple across the globe. The dumb fucks were dumping vast quantities of gold into lakes, but couldn't be bothered to make a wheel.

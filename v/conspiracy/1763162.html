            Very good point, and I agree having a plan like that in place in a city were 99% of it is built to the sky is a good plan.  Cause man if one of those buildings went over the destruction would be insane.

            Obviously manual, but still means there are explosives just sitting there, that was more my point.
And I wouldn't be surprised if there is footage of that, since we all have seen the footage of them being demo'd.
whatever happened that day be it government cover up or actual terror attack, you cannot deny that those building were brought down in a controlled manner.

</blockquote>
<p>One of the key passages that I reference in this video should resonate with many here, from <a href="http://bnarchives.yorku.ca/259/2/20090522_nb_casp_full_indexed.pdf"> &quot;Capital as power: a study or order and creorder&quot; (PDF)</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We  begin  by  defining  historical  society  as  a  creation  of  order,  or creorder – a  word  that  connotes  the  paradoxical  fusion  of  being  and becoming,  state  and  process,  stasis  and  dynamism.  The  algorithm  of  the capitalist creorder is  capitalization.  This  is  the  mechanism  through  which capitalist  power  is  commodified,  structured  and  restructured.  The  static architecture  of  this  power  is  defined  by  differential  capitalization.  At  any point in time, the distribution of capitalized values maps the division of power among  the  different  owners.  But  the  capitalist creorder compels  owners not only to retain their power, but to try and augment it; not only to protect their  differential  capitalization,  but  to  increase  it  through  differential  accumulation.</p>
<p>&quot;The result is a strong gravitational force. This force – anchored in power rather  than  productivity  –  pulls  the  independent  units  of  capital  closer together.  It  causes  them  to  join,  coalesce  and  fuse  into  ever  larger  units. Eventually, it gives rise to tight constellations of large corporate–government alliances. These constellations constitute what we call dominant capital.&quot;</p>

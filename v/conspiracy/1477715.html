<p>Also, the main code words for pedophilia seem related to the Italian language (eg. pizza, pasta, dominoes).

            historically, many of the most well known and key figures in the "Italian" mafia weren't Italian and at least some had ties to foreign intel, and i don't mean in Italy ... just sayin'

            Maybe the mafias on the vaticans payroll, they probably arrange for the blackmailing of politicians with cp, and blackmail is something the mafia is known for.

            It used to be well known that the Italian Mafia distributed most of the pizza toppings in the US.  Not as well known now.  Also, the fact that so many pizza places use mafia lingo has fucked with the Google algorithm.

            I watched that documentary and found it very interesting. For me it was propaganda from the opposite camp from the propaganda I grew up with. I don't believe the propaganda from either camp, but it was a bracing counter-balance to how I was programmed. I have done some research in this area. I don't think Hitler was the monster he is presented as. They say that history is written by the victors and I think it is true in the case. The Allies won. Stalin helped to demonize Hitler to draw attention away from his own atrocities. I find David Irving's research to be convincing. He and others claim that Jews were put into work camps and suffered and died from starvation and typhus but that there were no extermination camps, no gas chambers. Look at alternative research, look at the evidence and make up your own mind. Things are not as we were programmed to believe. 
Some say Hitler was descended from the Rothschilds. Some say the Jews were the puppet-masters of the Nazis to ensure that the world would not deny Israel to the Jews.

            Another theory (from the perspective of the neocons... So consider the source), is that the confusion is being created on purpose, as a divide and conquer strategy to help China.  It would also explain why Trump and Barr are looking to pass the EARN IT Act, and thus crease a more centralised internet.

            Go there and see.  They may have been given a directive with incentive on what to say.

           <p>
            Another angle is that if ALL elective and minor procedures are cancelled, that may provide the bandwidth for all coronavirus patients to be treated, while hospitals seem empty.

             The fact that other procedures have been cancelled is already known, while the media paints the picture that all NYC hospitals are "a war zone" due to coronavirus alone. According to the media, no hospital in NYC should be or "seem" empty on any level. The official story is that they are so overrun they don't have enough staff or equipment to deal with the corona cases that are filing in nonstop. That the morgues are overflowing into tents &amp; refrigerated trucks. This picture is at odds with the citizen footage, and cannot be reconciled.

            Our local hospital refers patients to their personal doctors if they are not showing covid-19 symptoms.  All elective surgeries have been postponed...only life-saving surgeries for now.  And anyone brought to the emergency room gets seen immediately.  No one is allowed to sit in a lobby.

              I've seen it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't profess to know wtf is going on re the virus.  I've discussed it with friends and acquaintances and we can't come to anything concrete.  There are too many odd things going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would Trump hold press conferences daily for weeks and shut down the US economy?  First it was "14 days to flatten the curve", now it's "30 days to slow the spread".
             </p>
             <p>
              I watch the pressers, and try to determine by their words, actions, and reactions to see if I can get a handle on it.  I test it all.  "If it were real, why would he say this?"  "If it were fake, why would he say this?"
             </p>
             <p>
              He says GM and 3M and other companies are converting over to make hundreds of thousands of ventilators and millions of masks, and we're gonna have so many ventilators and masks we're going to supply the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              And he talks about making decisions on when to restart the economy at a later date, "in the upcoming weeks" or "in June or July" or "we'll see in August or September".  Two or three weeks ago, he said he would
              <em>
               like
              </em>
              to have things back to normal by Easter.  He says he would
              <em>
               like
              </em>
              to have all this over in a few weeks.  He would
              <em>
               like
              </em>
              to have Americans back in schools and stadiums this fall.
             </p>
             <p>
              If it were all fake, why would he prattle on about hydroxychloroquine?  Why would he openly question Fauci re the testing?
             </p>
             <p>
              Over the past couple of days, Trump has said "We're over the top," then both Fauci and Birx stepped up to the mic and said we should expect higher numbers over the next two weeks, and the worst is yet to come.  They can't get their stories straight.
             </p>
             <p>
              And 2 to 6
              <em>
               trillion
              </em>
              dollars suddenly being used to hold up the economy?  How can this not be a fourth quarter Hail Mary pass?
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet it seems to me that if they wanted to truly use this moment to usher in the new world order, the UN and the WHO and the CDC and their minions would be shouting from the rooftops that the virus can attach to bills and coins, so we have to immediately move to digital currency to prevent deaths.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that's another thing...if it were fake, why would they tell us that only the elderly and/or unhealthy get it?  Wouldn't the media and our leaders fill the screens and pages with sob stories to spread the fear among us all?
             </p>
             <p>
              So many questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is it all theatre?  I'm not ruling it out.  We got fucked royally by our leaders and the media owners on 9/11.  But I saw the early videos out of Wuhan, and the vids of that doctor begging for help, and they seemed pretty real to me.  And I've read reports of how there are multiple strains, that the virus can change and return each year, making it a seriously deadly "common cold".
             </p>
             <p>
              So re the virus, I don't trust what any of them say because it's too convoluted.  I don't know anyone with it.  It could be "just the flu, bro" or it could be an ELE, dropping us down to the numbers stated on the Georgia Guidestones.
             </p>
             <p>
              But one thing is for certain: while us proles are debating whether or not the virus is as bad or worse than what we are told, tptb are hard at work on their version of our future.

              <p>
               I agree with DeadMary on the point about the elites never passing up an opportunity to advance their agenda. That is the only thing I can be sure of at this point, as I think we all can.
              </p>
              <p>
               But the virus statistics and all the talk around them are not trustworthy, they are always changing, veering this way &amp; that, contradicting each other and basically painting a nonsense picture as you have noticed.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I'm totally with you on not having a settled outlook on it. I have not been paying much attention to the pressers, I would like to but I am using all my free time researching on the back end, on the sides of things that aren’t legitimately discussed in the big public forums, the MSM. If they do mention something like 5G or employ any pseudo critical thinking about the virus statistics, it is only to “debunk” them,
              </p>
              <p>
               And therein lies the seeds of suspicions. As always, the powers that be are constantly fighting to steer the population away from the truth, so these “debunking” claims are the best clues. Why else would they be fighting so hard, and spending billions to make sure Americans know the “truth” about coronavirus. Is is because they are so compassionate? Just look at the Google search results for  “coronavirus truth”. It is all “debunking” &amp; “what you need to know about coronavirus” &amp; “how to stay safe during the pandemic”, etc etc. Is that because they care so much about us, and don’t want us to get sick &amp; die? Is it because they just love truth &amp; want to spread it? I don’t think for example that Snopes cares about us or the truth, quite the opposite. They want control and depopulation, so they are going to feed the public information that is in alignment with their narrative &amp; agenda.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have looked into the 5G connection, but that is difficult to research, or I don’t have the skills to do it but I am working on it. I have thought about chemtrails as well, but that thread is also shrouded in mystery thus far.
              </p>
              <p>
               As of today I don’t believe we are dealing with a highly contagious &amp; deadly virus. I suspect that a virus exists as it would during any other flu season, and that it is being used as a smokescreen for something else that is deadly, of course, the ultimate goal is depopulation, and to employ the Hegelian dialectic whereby they can easily usher in more control with their “solution”.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do question the numbers, but I don’t doubt that people are getting sick &amp; dying. I personally know one man from my church who died, but I also know that doctors are being told to register all deaths as coronavirus-related if the patient tested positive for the virus, regardless of any evidence to the contrary.
              </p>
              <p>
               So what does testing positive mean? There is another bag of questions. The testing is flawed, rendering it meaningless in the big picture. Also, who is to say that you or I would not have tested positive a year ago? We could have antibodies that are remnants from a previous infection, totally harmless, yet present in testing. Makes it mighty convenient for the covid19 agenda to “prove” it’s “unprecedented” spread. This would help to explain why the great majority of positive testers are symptom free. How many deadly viruses do we know of throughout history that “spread like wildfire” but simply do no harm to the great majority of the infected?
              </p>
              <p>
               And then there is also the vaccine connection which theorizes that the virus is deadly for those who received a recent flu vaccine.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember, this faction of the population is murderous, they will give us hints, they will even proclaim their intentions, but sorting it all out is a job for us, they are not going to connect the dots for us.

               Thanks for the suggestion, childish is the other word I'd throw around here freely. I don't care that you edited your post. You added nothing. You commented only for attention because you are a gamma male &amp; can't get it any other way. Try adding to a conversation. If you cant, go away.

            This post doesn’t even make sense. Maybe you could try.. idk... ASKING THEM why. Some hospitals are set up to take these people others not. It’s not like all of NY is sick you fucking moron.

             You obviously haven't seen the citizen investigation videos that everyone else has. ALL hospitals in NYC are set up to take covid 19 patients,ADOY. Not only that, they have expanded their facilities to outdoor tents &amp; refrigerated trucks to hold the dead bodies, that is the story we are told, and yet somehow you have not heard about any of this because you're too busy squirting gamma fag.

           there are some disturbing similarities between Anthony wiener and bill Clinton. As such i have been reviewing events from the mid 90s and have come to the conclusion that weiner was grooming young girls for sex, and Clinton HAD groomed young girls for sex, but did not get caught because there was no Internet back then.

           Lewensky was from a liberal arts college in Portland Oregon, a known human trafficking hotspot. This college is also connected to Muhammad bin Nayef as well as has an alleged serial killer. The cops believe that they know who the killer is but "lack evidence" to convict them.  This was the college she was attending when she was an intern.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason why i suspect she was coerced, was that she saved the semen on the dress. I understand that women can be insane and creepy in their own way, and in a normal situation i would write this off. However what is concerning is not only Bill Clinton's rapist past, but also his words. It was not "The private lives of my staff  are none of your business, especially when they are not breaking the law" It was "I did not have sex with that woman". What clinton did was not illegal. So why cover it up? The general consensus was that they claimed that a sex scandal would have been bad for politics, but in the sex fueled 90s as well as the alleged drug use, i find this hard to believe.

          </p>
          <p>
           The other bit of circumstantial evidence comes out of the podesta emails. There is a mention of "lollipop" waiting for someone after a speech, and that they were a great help and appreciated their efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is also the harvey weinstei/ clinton connections as well. where known pervert weinstein was doing political favors and giving them money.

           In fact, the more that comes out, the more i suspect that the lewensky scandal was made public on purpose, after they discovered that she still had that dress.** I suspect that she held on to that dress, as evidence that she was coerced into a relationship with clinton.**  They made the scandal public and a circus then, because they did not want that to come out in an environment that would be politically unfavorable later.

            Take this with a grain of salt, I guess, but i love to research MKUltra and I remember awhile back reading from someone who took note of the moles on Monica’s face and how the pattern of them was indicative of trauma/programming.

             How does trauma create a mole? If this is true, then that would mean that there is a gene damaging chemical involved, that would be traceable. If so, then that would be an extremely dangerous oversight for the deep state, because there are tools that exist that can do chemical analysis from a distance. These tools will only get cheaper and better in the near future.

            Lewinsky was unappealing and as the president of the USA Bill could have done much better. Ann Coulter said Bill Clinton is gay and she would know. Lewinsky had a background in acting and way too many red flags. The scandal was made public on purpose as overcompensation to hide Bill's gayness and to distract people from the main events. Hillary didn't get a divorce because she's gay too and she knew it was fake and was in on it. It explains everything.

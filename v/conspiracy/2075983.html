<p>They are right. The driver of the car that killed the woman in Charlottesville never met with Obama in the oval office. The question they are debunking and it\'s response by factcheck.org is an example of the way in which shills or establishment media outlets use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda">black propaganda</a> to their advantage.</p>
<p>The point of the question and the response by factcheck.org is to muddy the waters surrounding the TRUE story recently posted on ZeroHedge: <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-14/report-%E2%80%98unite-right%E2%80%99-organizer-jason-kessler-was-occupy-movement-obama-supporter-8-m">‘Unite the Right’ Organizer Jason Kessler Was Obama Supporter Involved With Occupy Movement</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with Twitter and social media in general, is that it has shortened people\'s attention spans to the extent that the nuance and details of a story posted are lost in the stream of continuous likes and reposts. In the three or four seconds they\'ve seen the story they\'ve equated CHARLOTESVILLE LEFT-WING COLLUSION/CONSPIRACY = DEBUNKED. And <em>that\'s it</em>, they will completely miss the fact that the tweet from factcheck.org and the story posted on zerohedge about Jason Kessler are not talking about the same person or allegations. In the minds of their followers, the entire issue as to whether the UTR protest was a form of controlled opposition for the purposes of creating a media spectacle and creating social tensions is settled. They will quietly pat themselves on the back for being so smart and enlightened and move on. AND THAT\'S IT. They\'ve hit the mute button on the issue, and it\'s lost in the stream of trivia and disinfo. </p>

            Wow. I thought for sure your post would have received far more upvoats by now. Makes it seem like this is all pointless, which it may be I guess.

            Great response and really interesting things to think about. I've been strategizing for about 10 years now. Formed an indie media group. It probably wouldn't surprise you that 9 of 10 project ideas we come up with are rejected for not having magic bullet quality. The only one that made it to completion was A Sandy Hook doc. The current best prospect is a citizen report about a controversial topic and some creative strategy involving the states attorney generals and the media. But we'll see.

            I have a million things to say about our state of affairs. But I'll skip to something I think is more interesting. I've seen many good ideas die because there was no marketing expertise. There's a reason why Apple pays 6 million for a little yellow stick figure. We need a never ending series of marketing campaigns. We can win if we're more clever than them. Who are "them?" Well, the best I can figure is the military industrial complex. Our friends who brought us the Iraq war. And their MOST used and MOST useful tool is the media. Fix the media and we fix the world. We could start by demanding they return the broadcast spectrum to the people. Funny, "pirates" "terrorists!" You get it.

            Beautifully said. And good job highlighting an example of this tactic. Have you considered ways in which to counter this tactic with one of our own? Because they control the mass media and therefore communications with the masses, our tactic would have to target the bad guys themselves. We know they are prone to jump on leaks that support their narrative. Maybe "one of their own plans to sell them out?" Then we observe the criminality unfold.

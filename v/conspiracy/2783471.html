<p>In the American Congressional System, each party has a leader and a whip. The &quot;whips&quot; are responsible for towing the party line in Congress; indeed they represent <em>the quintessential</em> political position on any given issue voted upon, respective to their party, be that Democratic or Republican:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In countries influenced by the British political system, a whip is an official of a political party whose task is to ensure party discipline in a legislature. Whips are the party\'s &quot;enforcers&quot;; they invite their fellow legislators to attend voting sessions and to vote according to the official party policy. The term is taken from the &quot;whipper-in&quot; during a hunt, who tries to prevent the hounds from wandering away from the pack.</p>

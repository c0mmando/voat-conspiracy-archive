            I don't know much about him but I do know he predicted 9/11 and it being blamed on Osama before it happened. That's enough to give the guy at least some credibility.

            He lied about some stuff but he predicted the shit out of 9/11 and a month later the government killed him.

            Bill Cooper was a drunk. Fine. He had some faults. He also had some good insights. Occasionally, he promoted sources which might not have been the best. For example, he doesn't question the origin story of "The Report from Iron Mountain" too closely. At the same time, he did an absolutely brilliant Al-Jazeera type job of repeating the information as he found it. He gives the reader the complete document and let's the reader draw the conclusions. A lot of other authors would quote judiciously and fit the document to their perspective. I don't always believe his conclusions -- but he never said I had to. He focused on presenting information. In this, his approach is like WikiLeaks. I generally don't find him to be a waste of time.

            . I believe history is bearing that out. On the other hand, he drank a lot and that seemed to be a factor in his death. (For some reason, criticisms of Cooper always start with "William Cooper was a drunk." Fine. 1890 called -- it wants it's virtues back.) I can't quite judge what went down -- was he silenced or was he a cantankerous drunk who fought with a sheriff?
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd take his material as a starting point for my own consideration. Cooper might have missed details about context, etc. but he has a nose for obfuscation. It's also telling to me how much debunking he's received. I'd say he was on to something -- whether he knew what that was or could separate the signal from noise is debatable. But his approach threatened people -- more than Marrs or Ventura. He's like Mark Lane in that regard.

             What a crock of shit.  Cooper was a delusional paranoid reptile alien conspiracy theorist.  His talks were about how the government is hiding aliens.  Nothing he said made sense. And he shot at cops so they killed him.  Now his fans all brigade Alex Jones and blame him.

             Alex Jones gives actual real facts and info.  Not made up shit from a bottle of whiskey.  There aren't any aliens attacking Earth. Nobody killed him for his stupid beliefs.  He died because he shot at cops.

              . Really, in that chain of six words, two are name calling and two are board defining. You could call Jones a "delusional paranoid satanic globalist conspiracy theorist". Probably, it would still belong on this board.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's kind of fun to do this, though. Just swap around the words and see how it falls out: "CNN gives actual real facts and info. Not made up shit from a coke binge with Charlie Sheen. There aren't any satanists controlling Earth. Nobody censored him for his stupid beliefs. He got divorced because he was on the DL."

              I never weighed in on what happened with Cooper's death. The truth is -- I don't know. There's not much I can do about it, either. He's dead, and really all we have are his books and broadcasts. The quality varies, but there's something compelling in the obsessive samisdat style of Pale Horse.

              It's cool that you don't like Cooper. That's fine. Probably you should have told OP that "Cooper sucks because..." You know, fill in whatever you believe. I guess you're pissed that someone would challenge Jones. Okay. But... you know... that kind of blind devotion is pretty shitty. I'd yell some shit about "sheeple" and "waking up", but I'm too mellow right now.

                Did I say it wasn't okay? Did I petition mods? No, I even told you how to do it constructively. Hell, I called Cooper a drunk.

                You opened the invective with "what a crock of shit". If you're only dabbling in conspiracy as a chance to indulge in fanboy adulation, you could switch to Star Wars. It's less detrimental to employment. That's not a jab at you -- some kind of "get a job" shit -- but a lesson I'll share having watched several lawyers burn through decent careers in pursuit of FOIA and general resentment at being fucked with.
               </p>
               <p>
                From about 2004 to 2006, I was pretty interested in Jones. None of these authors/presenters are entirely reliable. (With a nod to Marrs' assertion that if they were important, like Trafficante, they'd be silenced.) I think Jones revealed his hand at the Austin gun rally. I stopped caring too much at that point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Think about what you did here: I summarized the fight between Cooper and Jones in response to a query about Cooper. I presented Cooper's own words (one of his better techniques). He may be wrong. That's on Cooper. You moved that fight to me, and sided with Jones. Are you looking for a fight? Are you just constipated? Feverish? Hung over? Besties with Jones? Your posts would be better directed at OP. List Cooper's bullshit. OP is interested and I'll admit Cooper was no saint. Probably even Cooper would have... Levenda does. Levenda might even be a terrible author in need of an editor, but he, too, has some strengths.
               </p>
               <p>
                You don't have to "follow" these people. You don't have to accept or defend them. Cooper is stoic in the cold earth and Jones can go cry into a huge pile of cash. Either way, "we" don't mean much to them. But if you need a savior, try Moroni. Those Latter Day Saints really take care of their own. Conspiracy authors? Well, one bought me a bowl of chili once... and that's about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                They all hate each other, BTW. If I had to pick one I would bitch about, a real personal grievance, I'd go with Clyde Lewis, but I'll admit his audio collage style and his sound-bite selections are brilliant. There's some artistry there. A lot of deceit, and a shabby human, but some undeniable skill. If I have to have a fight because I was shit-talking a conspiritard, I'd rather pick him. Unlike Jones or Ventura, he's certainly not in it for the money.

            Behold a Pale Horse is the conspiracy Bible. When I first read it in high school (pre-911), I threw it away thinking it was complete BS.

            This book was one of the first 'conspiracy' genre texts I read. It was amazing and still is. Cooper was murdered, as he had predicted he would be, for being too vocal about the obvious cover ups and denials from our government. People like Bill Cooper will be vindicated when our fearless leaders crumble under the weight of truth and progress and can no longer deny the existence and influence intra- and extra- terrestrials have had on our evolution thanks to world-wide disclosure.

            I am absolutely certain the next paradigm shifting event humanity will be affected by is disclosure. It is coming soon.

             Cooper pulled a gun on police.  Self fulling prophecy. He claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy.  This sounds so much like religion.  I walked into the woods and read the stones from god... just take my word for it.  No proof just have faith.  And then the government wants me dead for what I know.  Then he pulls a gun on them and bam he's dead.  Prophecy fulfilled.  Dude was a scam.  Fun to listen to but he wasn't telling the truth about half the stuff he said.

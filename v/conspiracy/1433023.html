            Fuck, haha I was literally just writing up a post about this before I thought to check for others, nice one Drain0!
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my take:

            "
            <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-19/paul-combetta-computer-specialist-who-deleted-hillary-clinton-emails-may-have-asked-reddit-for-tips">

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The evidence connecting Combetta to the account is circumstantial, but also voluminous.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So, now this Combetta who was granted immunity and set to testify, now can say that the posts were edited and he was not the one who deleted any emails on any server, nor does he have any knowledge of criminal activity on the server.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “The Reddit post issue and its connection to Paul Combetta is currently being reviewed by OGR staff and evaluations are being made as to the authenticity of the post,” Mr. Meadows told The Hill Monday.

            These two statements are pretty indicative of what they are planning in my mind. "circumstantial" "authenticity of post".

             Honestly, with the unlimited amount of resources the regressive left have right now and knowing of all the overtly underhanded tactics they are willing to stoop to just to pass their agenda, I would not be surprised at all if they paid off Spez to tie up loose ends prior to Trump being inaugurated. People have been speculating that he's going to call off the indictment of Clinton because the media has been twisting his words and attempting to project to his motives when he's only stated he was going to think about it. Here is the portion of the 60 minutes interview about the Clinton indictment unedited for people to come up with their own conclusion.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Lesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald Trump: Well, I’ll tell you what I’m going to do, I’m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we’ve been talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald Trump: And get the country straightened away.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lesley Stahl: You called her “crooked Hillary,” said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, “Lock em’ up.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald Trump: Yeah. She did--
             </p>
             <p>
              Lesley Stahl: Do you—
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--
             </p>
             <p>
              Lesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might…
             </p>
             <p>
              Donald Trump: I don’t want to hurt them. I don’t want to hurt them. They’re, they’re good people. I don’t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.

              Donald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--

              You don't 'hurt' people that you send to prison according to government, you rehabilitate them.

               See, I think it's too ambiguous of a statement. We don't really know his real plan as of yet and we don't know what kind of motivations he has.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another thing to put into question is why does he switch from the singular "her" when talking about the bad things Hillary did to the plural "them" when saying they're good people? Are there other people he's trying to protect? Does he just want to make sure all of his ducks are in a row before throwing the book at her? The Clintons have a huge blood trail behind them, the body count seems to grow anytime they are threatened so maybe he knows more than he's letting the public in on.

                Agreed, far too ambiguous.

               <p>
                I'm not American so unclear on the finer details, is the President-elect given that special briefing before or after inauguration?

               <p>
                If so, then you could be quite right, he could know a lot more than he's letting on.

               <p>
                My theory, Bill has used his political capital from Presidency and will throw his fake wife under the bus if need be to escape all the shady shit he's done. 
He may look like a geriatric but I've learned never to underestimate the guiles of older people, especially with the thought of spending your last days in prison. Thoughts?

                 What briefing are you referring to? To the best of my knowledge the transition period is a time when he starts getting briefed on many issues and policies. I'm not sure if he's currently privy to all of the information the FBI has on the Clintons.

                 Bill and Hillary have ZERO capital from his time as President. When they left the white house back in 2000 they were flat broke. There were even reports that they stole furniture and valuables from the white house and had to later return them. Bill was impeached and his license to practice law was revoked so he has not "worked" since he left the white house. Apparently their accumulation of wealth is from Hillary's time in the office as SoS and Bill and Hillary's "speaking fees" (bribes) and the alleged fund shuffling with the Clinton Foundation  But I agree, there is nothing too slimy for the Clintons.  I have no doubt if it came down to one of them having irrefutable evidence lined up against them that the other would definitely roll over or claim no knowledge just to save their own filthy hide.

                  I can't say which briefing, as I have no solid understanding of the progression of events, just wondering.

                 <p>
                  Zero financial capital, sure, but I'm talking knowledge of whose done what and how bad, a certain 'express' plane comes to mind. I bet we have only touched the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how far they've squirrelled away money and favours over the years.

                   I'm pretty sure somebody is going to uncover a huge pile of dirt on them. You can only sweep it under the rug so much until someone notices. I really want to see the Clinton crime syndicate brought to justice.

            Knowing the liberal nature of Reddit as a whole, it really wouldn't surprise me if they're on the ol Soros payroll and he took a bullet knowing that at least he/they would be taken care of financially for helping to protect the Clinton empire. Normally I would have dismissed something so far-fetched as delusional, but with all the smoking guns I've seen lately I really don't know what to believe.

            Unrelated because I don't have the points to make a post yet... abovetopsecret.com... why can't I join the forum? 'Server configuration error' for the last I don't know how long and contacting them has done nothing. Is abovetopsecret.com a psyop?

             Not even close. They were a part of the Laurel Canyon movement and his songs are full of sjw, leftist propaganda.

            <p>
             I still listen to the doors every now and then as my dad played them all the time growing up. Try to work out what the lyrics to "Whiskey bar" mean too.

              When I was 13 or so they were my favourite in the whole world...I have all their albums (except "Other Voices") on vinyl but I think I am selling them; I find most of it hard to listen to now.  Looking back he was a complete fake and the notion that he was so intelligent and "well read" is kind of bullshit.  It is a shame because other than Morrison they were a hellaciously talented bunch

               Definitely especially Robby Krieger, flamenco blues is otherworldly. That's awesome you have the vinyl must be worth a bit now, how does the sound quality compare to modern devices?

                Vinyl was kind of before my time or at least on the way out when I was a kid and my family just never got into it.  Honestly I don't think it is nostalgia when I say it sounds better (when you are playing something that was RECORDED on vinyl) which makes sense because it is uncompressed unlike modern music (which has literally been recorded at steadily higher compressions since It I think early 90's CD's.)  I have a cheap shit record player and my old country and blues sound great.  I have a couple new Blind Melon records that I haven't put on much and I am not sure I like the sound of those better than the CD's I had once upon a time

                 The hipsters are bringing it back or so I've heard and the Antique hobby buyers are always looking for items that will only rise in time. I never considered compression, that's great and I don't know if I'll ever fully understand how the fuck they work. The sounds are recorded into the discs by scratches and the pin runs over those scratches to produce the music? That's witchcraft right there.

            That Jim didn't like drugs is crazy talk.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Before the concert in Amsterdam, the Airplane purchased a slab of Lebanese Gold hashish, which they offered to Morrison to nibble. Greedily, he ate a huge chunk. Ray Manzarek remembers him stumbling on stage during the Airplane’s set. “Jim started singing with Grace and hugging her. Then he danced off the stage, went back into the dressing room and passed out.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Slick chuckles. “I liked Jim. Most women did. He was gorgeous, but he was so screwy – half the time you couldn’t talk to him. He used himself as a human guinea pig, see how far you can push the human brain. I remember coming back from an Airplane gig in 1967 and going to the Tropicana Motel with Kantner, and Morrison was in the hallway, goofy on acid, stark naked and barking like a dog. Paul just stepped over him and went into his room.”

             We need some old hippy faggot to figure this out: You can't eat pot (and have it become psychoactive); i thas to be solubized (word?) in fat to work that way.  I am not aware of any method of making hash that would make it an edible high but I could be wrong.  Also if he got all fucked up just from hash I would be surprised

              Another tale that Grace told about being in Amsterdam in the 68 Europe tour, people would hand them pills and drugs, and most of the people would say, "Thanks!" and put them in their pocket for later.  Jim, however, would take it immediately.  Reds, blues, uppers, downers, Ludes, acid, shrooms, whatever they handed him, he took it right there on the street.

             It said he didn't like heroin or the idea of needles. Doing acid and eating pot doesn't mean you'll do anything. Opiates aren't psychedelics.

              The article quoted an interview from 1970 which stated he didn't do drugs at all.  That the martini was his "Crystal Ship."

               makes me think good chance those musicians didn't die...
              </p>
              <p>
               then went back to their 'normal life'
              </p>
              <p>
               others, like zappa, are in it for life.

                  There were a LOT of "trendmakers" in the 60's in terms of music that were related to, or even IN military intelligence.  The Morrison to Admiral morrison question.  How did this film student, with no musical experience whatsoever, (seriously NONE) suddenly appear in Manzarek's garage with FULLY WRITTEN songs.  Not just lyrics, but fully composed songs?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Frank Zappa's dad was a chemical warfare expert at Edgewood Arsenal (tied to MK-ULTRA), Frank himself never did drugs.  Ever.  But encouraged everyone else to.  Oh, and his manager was this out of place guy named Herb Cohen, who was most likely CIA.  He was in Congo in 61 when the CIA took down Lumumba.  Just a cohencidence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  John Phillips (Mamas and Papas) put together the Monterey Pop Festival.  First of its kind.  Got ALL KINDS of media attention, even before they had a lineup set.  His dad was career navy.  Cass Ellito's parents were career Navy.  Oh, and he was somehow "In Cuba" during the Cuban Revolution where "Castro" forced Batista out of power.  Another Cohencidence.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Basically, there is a lot of Cohencidences running around Laurel Canyon and the music scene of the time.   The military and intelligence connections were astounding in their depth and breadth.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Overall, I'd say that the 60's
                  <em>
                   counterculture
                  </em>
                  /
                  <em>
                   hippie
                  </em>
                  movement was just the next step in the plan to take down America from within like we see today with the degeneracy.  The musicians at the time were seeded with specific thoughts and phrases and concepts that separated parent from child.  These were planted, they were encouraged, they were promoted, they were media driven.  This brought on the copycats and the second generation of musicians following the same ideals, but without the military connections.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Laurel Canyon scene on the mid 60's was the seed.  It was a plant to get the next generation of musicians to have a specific "leftist" agenda.  Controlled opposition.

            I forgot I knew Jim Morrison's father was an admiral. Now wonder, Jim Morrison was such a fuck up. That sort of office means you KNOW things, things MOST of us do NOT know about things.

             My understanding later in life was that Jim Morrison's dad was a spook and was the reason why Morrison was selected for fame.  The whole "my family is dead" shtick was just to keep people off the scent

              But that has a scent all it's own. I don't know squat about him, other than he seems evil to me, thinks WAY too much of himself, writes SHITTY poetry (pompous too), and is DEAD (good riddance). Learning his dad was an admiral, makes sense as to why he was the way he was.

                 I was talking more about the lyrics to the songs but as a 13 year old I thought they were boss and the movie and biography always made sure to tell me how well read he was.  Maybe you got super powers when your sister pushed you down the stairs

             Wiki: Some believe his Naval career may have been slowed by political undertones surrounding his analysis of the USS Liberty incident which occurred in 1967. Morrison opposed the official US Navy response to the attack, and proposed an immediate and swift economic and military response against Israel for the attack on an official US Navy ship. Morrison's analysis and political motivation was at odds with the soft non-militaristic response ultimately taken by the US State Department and US Navy. Morrison asserted Israel intentionally attacked the USS Liberty, trying to disguise Israel torpedo boats as Syrian vessels in an attempt to provoke a war between the United States and Syria. This would have increased United States military and financial assistance during the Six Day War.

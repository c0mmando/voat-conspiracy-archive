           I had a quick thought about how the african continent actually really looks like a poop.
          </p>
          <p>
           So by connecting the dots, with crime statistics by race, IQ distribution by race &amp; country I came to the conclusion that niggers are not natural.

           Nature literally warned us via subtle indicators that we missed, like the fact that Africa has the shape of a poop, that poop contains bad bacterias, and that
           <em>
            niggers literally have the skin color of poop
           </em>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Nature wanted to warn us of the danger of meddling with Africa and socializing with niggers but we missed her warnings.
          </p>

           No we as White people are paying the price as we chose to listen to the kikes instead of looking back and listening to nature.

           No back to my point, as I said niggers have the skin color of poop basically.

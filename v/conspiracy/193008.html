            Are you familiar with the term "argument from intimidation"? It is a form of fallacy. A common form is "I used to think like that but then I figured things out" another is "why are all of you people always so racist?" It wasn't a question it was an insult disguised poorly as inquiry. You did not give any examples of racism or quackery. sure you offered a couple of punching bag names but no example to go with them. Do you assume they are representative of everyone here? What specific racism have you observed? Why are people who attack conspiracy theorist so oblivious? Was that a question or a jab?

             I'm not trying to jab anybody, I was reading a post on infowars about facebook's pride picture generator or whatever, and it seemed like every single comment thread involved people accusing authority figures of being pedophiles, or trying to legalize pedophilia, or beastiality, or equivocating the president to an ape.  Why are they being so volatile and accusatory in what i one of fairy few places online where they can be relatively assured of being among like-minded individuals?

            Injecting those things into a movement can discredit it with the larger population, making it easier for them to simply disregard the entire message. One has to be careful not to encompass individuals into whole groups. There is also nuance, and from my experience nuance is forgotten when describing groups of people when the descriptions best suits purposes of discredit.

            A lot of lies and misdirection out there either by peoples who job is to make conspiracy theorist sound crazy or just useful idiots who take things in the wrong context or start spouting obvious disinformation around the net, thinking it is truth. Its kind of mind boggling how deep it goes.

            The best advice I can give you is to read everything, check the sources and put it on the back burner. If its low quality eventually it'll burn up and go away, but if you start making the right connections and reading the right books you'll end up with a delicious caramel of knowledge.

            Voat is still small so those who pay attention to all fun happenings around the net like reddit got a general feel for when to move onto other platforms. Voat will likely go the exact same route as reddit so tread with care. Every site will eventually be compromised.

            As for devil worshipers it wouldn't even surprise me at this point if its all true. The pedophilia scandals, the constant occult symbolism and the actions taken internationally by the powers that be. Its utterly insane.  Just follow the money and you'll start finding answers.

            One thing I will say though is that I think we live in a very interesting time to be alive and paying attention. Research into

            if you're really interested.  Belief is the enemy of knowing.

            If I had to give a short answer to your question, it'd be "because all those things you mentioned lie about what they're doing a lot more in order to push their agenda."

            And from big, deep-rooted lies come conspiracies.

            A lot of it is disinformation used to make believable conspiracies look just as wacky.  If someone starts getting a little too close to the truth, it wouldn't be hard for someone else to stand up and say something similar but with an added degree of nonsense.  That then makes both look as unbelievable as the second.  What's interesting is to look at various

<p><em>The Myth of Honest Gold</em></p>
<p>Gold can not think or feel it can not be honest or dishonest. Gold has no ability to be money without consensus.</p>
<p>We are entering a great time in modern history. A small window is opening. This window has opened before but never at a time when we had so much ability to find answers for ourselves. The chains of the gold and fiat currency standards have been dancing a ballet around us for over a thousand years. This transitional dance from a gold standard to a fiat standard has been so grand that it expands beyond ones lifetime experiences to detect.</p>
<p>We are on the cusp of another chance, our best chance to elevate and degage. We are being told that there are two camps that are about to set our future yet once again. The honesty of gold is on one end and the masters of the world that are setting our future behind closed doors are another. </p>
<p>I am here to tell you that you are the masters of your own fates and if you stand by and allow yourselves to let this pondering of what money is and what it can be pass you by then you have done yourselves a great disservice.</p>
<p>Corruption is not a value that one can assign to Money. Corruption is solely a value assignment we give to a man. Corruption is all we are being told is our option. Corruption we are told has been, is and will always be.</p>
<p>People are corrupt simply put because they have authority either given to or thrust upon them. Authority is little more than a group of people wanting someone else to think about and handle a situation for them.</p>
<p>The less thought we put into the situation ourselves the more corruptible this authority will become.</p>
<p>I can not assure you that your thinking about this will solve it but I can promise you that without thought we are simply stating that we enjoy this dance that occurs on stage just outside of the rabble our our daily lives.</p>
<p>This conversation about money and the honesty of gold is a slight of hand. A misdirection. Corruption is the devil behind the mask and our persistent contemplation is the angle of our liberty.**</p>',

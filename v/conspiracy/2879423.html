            the migrants also divide the country, the crisis is real, but it is an artificial crisis created by the communist international deep state, to steer up the pot. once people come to their senses and start asking questions and demanding shit, politically something always has to happen to fuel the system, or people would turn away from democracy and the established parties. their aim is to keep the illusion of 50-50% democrat-republican votes, to keep their fake system running.

            I assume that Sanders is sheepdogging, getting people who don't like Hillary all excited and then will drop out or lose and try and get his supporters to follow her.

            Trump has a role to play by pushing the "tea party" SJW from republican side to blue side, divide the party. That is to get the majority for Clinton/Sanders. Should Grampie Sanders (74y/0) would win, and name hillary VP, then certainly the key is to make sure that his health does not dramatically decline in his first months in office. It would seem that they will give Bernie/Trump/Bush 4 years to create a problem , then surrender to Nanny Clinton in 2020 for 8 years to fix everything.

             Even the insane trans and gay groups dont support clinton because she supported the anti-gay marriage thing those years ago, so I'd be surprised if Bernie made her VP, but crazier things have happened. Hopefully states will just start seceding again so we can kill all the fucking bankers and cunts running this country into the fucking dirt. But we shall see

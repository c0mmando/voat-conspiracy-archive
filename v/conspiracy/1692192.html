            While I agree to this as most members of this community in particular are already aware of what goes on with Reddit. I felt obligated myself to make a post about my experience at
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            due to the silly nature in which I was banned, under rule 10, trying to out shills where actually I was just being too honest for one of the moderators to handle, I have attempted to appeal the ban but I have realized that not only would it be frivolous but also fruitless because reddit is a disgusting cesspool and Voat is much better.
           </p>
           <p>
            More users that switched from
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
             r/conspiracy
            </a>
            came out in my self.post to this thread, and it turns out there was one guy banned over 40 times and he isn't inflammatory whatsoever and showed some of his post history. It's a shame but Reddit wears it all too well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck Reddit.

            sorry m8, only idiots visit reddit for conspiracy and politics. After what their mod did to the_donald, there's no reason to visit reddit for politic-related things unless you are Hillary die hard supporter

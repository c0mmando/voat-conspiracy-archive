<p>How is it that Rodney Alcala aka the Dating Game Killer was allowed onto the Rockefeller estate in NY not once, but twice, and maybe more times? </p>
<p><em>Alcala is reportedly a suspect in at least two cold cases in New York. One of those is the case of Ellen Jane Hover, 23, a restaurant heiress who disappeared in 1977 after leaving her Manhattan apartment. A year later, <strong>her bones were found in a shallow grave in a rugged section of the Rockefeller estate</strong> in Westchester County, about <strong>100 feet from a spot where Alcala allegedly brought another young woman</strong> for a photo session, authorities told the Orange County Register.</em></p>
<p>Was Alcala chosen to be a trained killer for the elite? </p>
<p><em>He is also a suspect in the June 12, 1971, rape and strangulation of <strong>Cornelia Crilley</strong>, a 23-year-old TWA flight attendant whose body was found in her Manhattan apartment on 83rd Street. Authorities say Alcala\'s DNA matches genetic material found at the crime scene.</em></p>
<p><em>Crilley\'s <strong>then-boyfriend, Leon Borstein, was a prosecutor in the Brooklyn district attorney\'s office</strong> when she was killed. Borstein said he was baffled that the NYPD won\'t release the pictures.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I don\'t know why they are keeping it secret,&quot; Borstein told the Daily News.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rodney-alcala-case-nypd-refuses-to-release-photos-of-serial-killers-possible-victims/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rodney-alcala-case-nypd-refuses-to-release-photos-of-serial-killers-possible-victims/</a></p>
<p>How is it that a serial killer just so happens to have access to Rockefeller property where he kills an heiress of all people and kills the girlfriend of a DA prosecutor? Was he hired to shut people up directly or indirectly? </p>
<p>At 19:17 of the YouTube Documentary &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;, there\'s clear proof that there\'s an accomplice because of the enhanced photo. There\'s simply no way someone else could be photographed in the picture without another person being there to take it. Unless someone can prove me wrong and say that technology was advanced so far that the camera could be set up to snap photos on a timer. </p>
<p>There\'s also another photo in the mix nearby this one where it shows Alcala standing with a woman as someone else is snapping the photo. Like I mentioned, unless camera tech was advanced enough to have it set to snap the photo after 30 seconds or so, there was another person present. Although, there are some photos that show two women together, so it is possible that a 2nd female victim was taking the photo. </p>

<p>Man of you will remember this incident where the body of a missing 17 year old was found on the Queen\'s property on New Year\'s Day.</p>
<p><em>British police said that a young woman\'s body was found in the forest at <strong>Sandringham</strong> and that they are treating it as a murder case.</em></p>
<p><em>the vast country estate where Queen Elizabeth II and her family gathered in rural splendor to celebrate Christmas and New Year\'s.</em></p>
<p><em>The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, <strong>celebrated the holidays at Sandringham with their children and grandchildren.</strong> The royal couple were still at Sandringham on Tuesday, along with their youngest son, Prince Edward, and his wife, Sophie.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45850427/ns/world_news-europe/t/murder-inquiry-after-female-remains-found-uk-queens-estate/#.WxIKziAh3IU">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/45850427/ns/world_news-europe/t/murder-inquiry-after-female-remains-found-uk-queens-estate/#.WxIKziAh3IU</a></p>
<p>Finally, <strong>two men were arrested</strong> for the girl\'s murder. Again, notice it\'s TWO men who happened to drive 30 miles to dump the body on the Queen\'s property and the gruesome discovery happens on a holiday, New Year\'s Day, while the Queen and her family are spending the holidays. </p>
<p><em>Miss Dmitrijeva was last seen alive in August and police believe her body had been in the field since September.</em></p>
<p><em>They believe that before her disappearance she spent the early hours of August 31 in a car park at Snettisham beach. The car park is about 30 miles from where the body was found.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sandringham-body-two-arrested-over-corpse-found-on-queens-estate-7704103.html">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sandringham-body-two-arrested-over-corpse-found-on-queens-estate-7704103.html</a></p>
<p>I wonder what made the police believe she\'d been there since September? Maybe, but it seems unlikely that a place frequented by the public wouldn\'t have noticed an odor or seen the body for four months? Let\'s not forget that she\'d been missing for an entire year before she was found deceased. So, where was she held for the remainder of the time before September? </p>
<p>For those of you who have read &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot; and/or watched the numerous YouTube documentaries about McGowan\'s research, you should be well aware that there are indeed serial killer cults that exist, but the questions remains, who essentially controls them. Serial killers in general whether organized or disorganized are typically under nobody\'s control given their own standards, but I my theory is that they can and are being controlled by the elite for specific reasons yet unknown. </p>
<p>I hope other hard core researchers will help look into this and find other parallels to keep things on track. Have other bodies been found on elite properties? Bundy was closely associated with the Republican party and Gacy was a clown with access to children and believed to have been working with an accomplice, but was he known to hobnob with any elite or political figures? Thanks to those who will examine this further and dig for more evidence.</p>',

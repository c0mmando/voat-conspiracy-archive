            If the FBI covered this up because the scandal was too large and threatened to topple the government, they had an obligation to expose it because if the government needed to be toppled by the people it deserved to be toppled. If they did cover it up, they should be disbanded as well.

            Now we have a hunch why Comey was ready to not jail and charge HRC. Becaust the Russian Uranium One deal was in HRC's emails and it shows Comey's FBI covering up for HRC or some thing else is going on that basically says Hillary and Comey are BFFL and Comey abused his power and the FBI to make all his dirty crimes go away. Emails or not the FBI's corruption was bound to come out. And every one at the FBI must know what they're boss's are doing. And they're going along with covering they're boss's ass or they're own. Oh they knew they're boss's are in some deep state corruption and collusion. It's not just the higher ups. It's all of them. Why they all betrayed Americans and sold us down the river i have no idea. The FBI betrayed America. And the FBI betrayed itself.

            But again, another distraction. As evil as she is/was, if she's still alive she should be brought to justice, but it's those even we cannot identify are probably the most evil, out of sight, people like whoever is telling George Soros what to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            We could say oh easy that's Evelyn De Rothschild, but that's too easy. Even he is too well know. Those committing crimes aginst humanity and importantly the people telling their lieutenants what to do, THOSE ARE the people that need to get outed and brought to justice.

            It is the proof that started this avalanche of evidence. When the Panama Papers were released, it proved Troika Dialog is a Russian front.

            That is proof John Podesta works for Russia. It is an LD 1 disclosure form. It shows he is getting paid by Troika Dialog.

            Big picture, this means that the entire DNC is being kept in power by the Russians with Russian money.

            But, it gets worse than that. Ruben Vardanyan has a lot of such companies, like Joule Unlimited that claimed to be able to produce clean energy from cyanobacteria... but was really just a Russian front to pay into the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been trying to get people to listen for ages. The Clinton Foundation is a CIA front that runs pay for play and forensic interruption to keep it's clients out of jail. The CIA has co-opted resources in Russian energy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Russia isn't our enemy, they are controlled by the intelligence community and they have to pay into our protection racket. Meanwhile, the news is in the pocket of our intelligence community and it isn't meant to inform you, it is used as a tool of policy change where it 1) is always gradually asserting authoritarianism and 2) always hiding the activities of the intelligence community.

             Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the "Chechen mastermind" they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that "many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin's reign." [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, "Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he's about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up."

            What is crazy, is that even organized crime won't go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob.

           <p>
            Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list:

            At no point do either of these articles mention some of the most important evidence. They don’t explain Troika Dialog. They don’t explain the Panama Papers. They never get around to addressing the 100,000 shares of Joule vested over 4 years at 25,000 shares per year into Leonidas. However, reading both of these articles, you can feel informed about the issue, while never being able to come to any type of solid conclusion. That is how the news works.

            The truth is that the deal started with Kazatomprom and the guy in charge was arrested and jailed for treason, abuse of power, corruption, and embezzling natural resources for his own personal profit. His name was Moukhtar Dzhakishev

           <p>
            One country already found this behavior treasonous, and then the same thing was done in America, by selling off US uranium to Uranium One, which is owned by the Russians. US politicians were making millions selling off everyone’s Uranium, including our own.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why do we not bring democracy to Russia by leaking all of their corruption? The same reason Russia doesn’t do the same thing to us. They have an ongoing financial relationship.

            Qatar and Glencore are both involved with the Clintons in questionable ways. Marc Rich, the CEO of Glencore was given a last minute pardon by Bill Clinton, while in office. Ironically, James Comey was the prosecutor. The documents are partially available in the FBI Vault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Qatar’s US weapon purchases were expanded 1400% after donating to the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should trouble every American that this is business as usual. Particularly when the press is in on it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a list of journalists who collaborated with the DNC, to varying degrees, as exposed by Wikileaks:

           </p>
           <p>
            Still, there are other channels of communications than just Podesta’s Gmail account or Hillary’s private server. The Wikileaks list is only a glimpse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scandal forced the Podesta Group to amend their past relationships AGAIN and we start to see how things really work in Washington. A lobbying group accepts money from foreign countries and private companies so that they have more of a voice in government and policy than the American voters.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Donald Trump won the election, the Podesta Group filed the most revealing list, yet, in a form known as ‘Amendment to Registration Statement Pursuant to the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended.”
           </p>
           <p>
            This is one piece of that document that shows that lobbying firms make deals with the news to represent their client’s interest. We already know what these conversations look like from Wikileaks; varying degrees of cooperation.

            So, what is being revealed here is that the Clinton Foundation has taken over for the American Security Council Foundation in looking out for the mining interests in the world. What is scary is that, even according to the State Department Reports, the Kazakhstan mines use slave labor. Glencore uses slave labor. VCS Mining uses slave labor.
           </p>

            THE CLINTONS, BESIDES ALL THIS BRIBERY AND CIA GUN RUNNING AND PARTICIPATION IN THE DRUG TRADE ARE FACILITATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING NETWORKS.

              I actually think that the Joosians answer to the Morlocks but that's likely just due to too much acid in my formative years.

                I think it's a reference to those that act primarily from the part of the brain that science has described as reptilian.  The sick occult elite like to adhere to their traditional black magic  practice, which includes full disclosure of contracts.  If one is informed of the conditions of participation in their slavery systems, doesn't protest, and participates anyway, they put themselves under defacto contract.  The lizard brains put the details of their social contracts right out there in the open for everyone to see.  Their shit is so crazy that it's easy to label anyone calling them on it a kook......in the past at least.  It seems that even the idiots are starting to catch on lately, but that's engineered as well.  Shit's about to go down.

             I could understand when they told us  Russia was godless and communist and that they were a threat to freedom. But Russia today is god-fearing (Eastern Orthodox is christianity) and they are - capitalist. Granted it's a fucked up system of capitalism but I would argue, no more fucked up than ours at this point in time.
            </p>
            <p>
             So why are we still told that they are still the enemy?

              Russia wanted influence and uranium, getting to prove American politicians are easily corruptible was a bonus.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now the US is caught between two hard choices: prove Russia is "evil", or protect the "integrity" of their politicians.

               Do you think Russia is evil?  I suppose it is relative, but I would rather have closer ties to Russia than Israel.   Slavic women are pretty hot, so that's an added bonus.

               It seems like Russia, Hungary, and Poland know what is going on.  We will see about Britain and Brexit.  We need to make gains in the US, and I hope it is about to happen.

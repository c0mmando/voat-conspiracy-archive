<p>But there is a less obvious issue that occurred to me recently and I have been continually disturbed by it over the past week. It started when I watched this video:
(<a href="https://www.hooktube.com/watch?v=4dwjS_eI-lQ">https://www.hooktube.com/watch?v=4dwjS_eI-lQ</a>)</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with psychiatry directly, but a tremendous amount implicitly. The video depicts a family that owns several of an extremely rare pet - the domesticated fox. Foxes, until quite recently, have never been domesticated and these pets were actually the product of a scientific experiment. Some psychologist was interested in the process by which dogs transformed from wolves and became integrated into Western culture  by means of domestication. The process by which this occurred is unknown. The researcher decided to experiment on foxes with the concept of domestication. For several generations, he monitored the aggressiveness and docility towards humans of a population of foxes and only allowed the most pleasant ones to breed. Shockingly (to me at least), this method was very effective and in only decades he had created a group of sufficiently domesticated foxes that can be owned as pets.</p>
<p>The most disturbing implication of this video is the rate of the genetic change. The theory of evolution, as it has been taught to me, is always couched in the notion that genetic changes happen at a glacially pace. The idea that we are genetically indistinguishable from humans 10,000 years ago is repeated ad nausem. Perhaps, it is true, I really don\'t know; but what the fox research shows clearly is that, when constrained and controlled, meaningful genetic changes can occur very rapidly.</p>
<p>One implication of this is the pacification of our population by means of the &quot;medication&quot; and consequent killing of unruly people to create  a compliant serfdom. This is both interesting and terrifying, but it is not the subject that has been bothering me recently. What has been bothering me recently is the same process but with regardless to intellectuals.</p>
<p>It\'s no secret that, historically, what we call &quot;mental illness&quot; has been associated with genius. Conditions like OCD and Schizophrenia seem highly prevalent in scientific communities. Furthermore, these conditions are the prime target of psychiatric abuse. It\'s glaringly obvious that these demographics are been attacked and killed off by the idiocy and iniquity of the psychiatric establishment. What will this lead to? My fear is that, like with the foxes, we will drastically change the genetic distribution of our population. The prevention of the so-called mentally ill population from breeding could possibly lead to a rapid removal from the gene pool of the genetic substrates of intelligence. If what I\'m saying is true, in a few generations we could have a population of entirely doltish consumers, absent of anyone who could understand something like mathematics. The idea of a &quot;scientist&quot; could become so removed from our society that it is remembered only as myth.</p>',

            A quick background on wolves is that primitive cultures realized that if you gave them scraps they would alert/defend the area that provided the scraps.  This was 30k years ago and a great example of cost/benefit.  Obviously the 'king' would want the biggest wolves/dogs and the queen wanted the smallest/cutest.  This is how selective breeding began.
           </p>
           <p>
            The good thing about humans is some of us like to keep history.  Obviously there are some who want to eradicate what is kept but enough know everything needs to be retained.  You know that textbook your parents kept?  Ya, it's more important than any paperback.  Only because it tells you what was known at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give you something simple.  Boil willow bark and drink that if you have inflammation or you have heart attack risk.

            American psychiatry is famous for heavily relying on drugs just so you know
           </p>
           <p>
            In other parts of the world, drugs are really the last resort and psychiatrist are often psychoanalyst too, main difference between both is that the psychiatrist is allowed to deliver drugs
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes, taking psychiatric medication while you aren't psychotic turns you into one

            The Dark Age descended across Europe when the intellectually advanced Romans became decadent and stopped getting married and having families, stopped joining the army to fight for the Empire, stopped working for a living and instead sat around all day watching free gladitorial games, while eating free food that was brought in from the far reaches of the Empire. Learning collapsed. Science and engineering collapsed. Schooling collapsed. All the technology of the Roman Empire was gradually lost. The infrastructure wasn't maintained and fell apart. Children were no longer taught to read. It didnt' happen overnight, but it happened. It can happen again, to us.

            For a white pill: as quickly as it is to corrupt, it will be as quickly to restore. Don't forget that these kikes have destroyed white culture many times before, and this is certainly not their first plot at world domination. It is our duty as ancestors of the great ones to repel these vile creatures once again back to wence they came.

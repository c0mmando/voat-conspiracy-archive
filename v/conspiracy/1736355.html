            This entire project started out innocently enough – Due to problems with registration changes in other states during the primary, I wanted to verify mine.  In the process, I saw an article about my state getting the Electronic Registration Information System (ERIC) at no cost through a grant from Pew Charitable Trust.  That piqued my curiosity, so I Googled “Hillary Clinton” and “Pew“ and learned that her former COS, Tamera Luzzatto - yes, the same one) was a Senior VP at Pew.

           </p>
           <p>
            THAT was the start of this nightmare.  I now know that this goes WAY beyond voter registration databases:  A global  group, Civil Society, designed the 2016 electoral process for a Clinton win

            – it was their easiest route to maintaining their present control over our government and to achieving their goal of global governance.
           </p>
           <p>
            U.S. citizens (and likely a chunk of the government) have no idea how U.S. independence has been compromised by the Open Government Partnership (OGP) agreement Obama signed in 2011.
            <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about">
             http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about
            </a>
            The OGP is the brainchild of Civil Society and has 70 member countries.  Civil Society works with each country's government to design, implement and monitor a National Plan specific to that country.  The mid-term assessment for the US National Plan was released in September of 2016 and can be viewed here:
            <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/default/files/USA_NAP3_self-assessment-report_20160916.pdf">

           </p>
           <p>
            SO…That’s the overall picture – Here’s the part specifically about the election.  This is a brief summary of a long-term strategic plan involving federal and state  legislation; developing, marketing, implementing new voting technology; and a “maze” of organizations and individuals who basically created an election monopoly.  It was genius in that no single aspect would arouse suspicion, and it went something like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2009 Schumer introduced the MOVE Act that allowed new voting technology to serve military voters overseas. A month later, Joe Goldman (future President of Democracy Fund,) presented “Strengthening Our Nation’s Democracy.” The plan? “Support and promote a comprehensive electoral reform agenda through both executive action (executive orders, agency coordination and Department of Justice [DOJ] enforcement) and active support for federal electoral reform legislation.”

           </p>
           <p>
            In October of 2009, VSSC/Project 1622 had its first meeting.  VSSC/Project 1622 was a private work group established to develop new voting technologies, notably a common-data-format for electronic generation of blank ballots.
            <a href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1622/WorkingDocuments/VSSC/c-vssc-1622-membership-roster-2015-03-18.pdf-">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2011, the Omidyar Groupwww.omidyargroup.com, created Democracy Fund (DF)
            <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/">
             http://www.democracyfund.org/
            </a>
            Their site says, “The Democracy Fund DOES NOT (their emphasis) accept unsolicited proposals. We proactively seek new grants based on strategic priorities and typically identify new grantee partners from within our network of allies and contacts. We work closely with grantee partners to help them achieve their goals.”  From 2011 through at least 2015, every grantee was involved in the election “scheme.”
            <a href="https://2014report.democracyfund.org/#grantees">
             https://2014report.democracyfund.org/#grantees
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Another Omidyar arm, Democracy Fund Voice (DFV)
            <a href="http://www.democracyfund.org/">
             http://www.democracyfund.org/
            </a>
            (and you really have to read "what we do" on their site) states on its site that it will work to appoint three EAC commissioners needed to reactivate the EAC's Standards Board, responsible for approving new voting standards.   The EAC SB inactivated in early 2102 because the EAC was down three commissioners.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of DF’s grantees was Pew’s Election Initiatives program.  Election Initiatives released ERIC in 2012, and ERIC has 21 member states.
            <a href="http://ericstates.org/">
             http://ericstates.org/
            </a>
            David Becker was responsible for marketing it.  Contributions increased to incumbent legislators who supported ERIC and to SOS with authority to order it.   Another Pew program, Voting Information Project, was a partnership with Google for a voter app.  Amy Cohen led this.
            <a href="http://votinginfoproject.org/about/">
             http://votinginfoproject.org/about/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In June of 2012, HRC had a one-hour closed-press/off-the-record meeting with the Pew Foundation Board of Directors.
            <a href="https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_December_Release/C05791176.pdf">
             https://www.wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/Clinton_Email_December_Release/C05791176.pdf
            </a>
            I have no idea if this was related to the Election Initiatives projects, but it was the only meeting with Pew found in the Wikileaks releases.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2013, based on requests from various organizations (all funded by DF,) Obama signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA.)  Most of the PCEA members are connected to Pew or and/or to entities receiving grants from DF.
            <a href="https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/">
             https://www.supportthevoter.gov/the-commission/
            </a>
            (Note: Support the Voter is a DF organization.)  In 2014, the PCEA released its final recommendations, identical to Goldman’s recommendations from 2009.

             http://www.ncsl.org/documents/legismgt/elect/RecommendationsPCEA_PatrickBeckerThomas.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2014, upon advice from the "stacked" PCEA, Obama appointed three EAC commissioners, all having ties to DF grantees.
            <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">
             https://www.eac.gov/
            </a>
            The EAC Standards Board was reactivated and approved Project 1622.
            <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/getieee/1622/download/1622-2011.pdf">

           </p>
           <p>
            In late 2015, Pew amped-up its ERIC marketing.  Pew began offering grants to states joining ERIC by May 31. Pew also gave states funding to cover mailing costs of registration postcards. States joined ERIC as late as July of 2016.  In August, Becker and Cohen departed Pew, ostensibly due to funding cuts and Pew “winding down” it’s election programs.  Within a month they formed a new company Center for Election Innovation, which appears to be related to ITIF an Omidyar organization.  Becker testified at the Science Committee Hearing on Cybersecurity in Elections in Sepember.

            The national coordinator of Vote By Mail (VBM,) Tammy Patrick, had ties to Pew, the PCEA, Bipartisan Policy Institute (a DFgrantee,) and Project1622.  Interestingly, the USPS link for election mail resources led to Election Center (a DF grantee)

            The Director of Election Center, Tim Mattice, was a Project1622 and TGDC member.

            Another DF grantee, Civic Designs, developed a Remote Ballot Marking System (RBMS.)

            Ohio (a recent ERIC join) may be "testing" Random Ballot Marking Systems (RBMS) in the election.
            <a href="http://www.publicnow.com/view/66C4E49C7F2DBF95F210154B8463E04343B149CF">

            </a>
            That proves RBMS IS operable - probably in at least all of the ERIC states. On September 27, 2016 the NCSL (DF grantee) released “Electronic Transmission of Ballots States.”

            Here is your proof.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they claim that the election was rigged, remind them of the "fact" that Hillary got the majority vote (
            <em>
             only because of the help of millions of illegal aliens, and dead voters
            </em>
            ). They will be all "SEE!".
           </p>
           <p>
            Then remind them that:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             In the Year 1824: Andrew Jackson Won Both the Popular Vote and the Electoral College, But John Quincy Adams Still Won the Election.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the Year 1876: Samuel J. Tilden Won the Vote but Rutherford B. Hayes Won the Election.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the Year 1888: Grover Cleveland Won the Vote but Benjamin Harrison Won the Election.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the Year 2000: Al Gore Won the Vote But George W. Bush Won the Election.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Were the Russians meddling in
            <em>
             those
            </em>
            elections?
            <em>
             No

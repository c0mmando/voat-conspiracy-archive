<p>China, phone taps, dirty money, Clinton </p>
<p>THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1999  
</p>
<p>Joseph Farah is editor of WorldNetDaily.com and executive 
director of the Western Journalism Center, an independent 
group of investigative reporters. </p>
<p>One of the secrets of the Clinton administration\'s success at staying in power has been to plot such dastardly deeds that few Americans could even grasp their evil intent. </p>
<p>Right at the top of the list of such conspiracies -- now well documented, thanks to the extraordinary efforts of WorldNetDaily columnist Charles Smith -- is the Clipper Chip project. </p>
<p>It involves all of the following: a treasonous relationship with China, a plan to tap every phone in America, drug money and, of course, the usual intrigue of administration figures such as Webster Hubbell, Al Gore, Ron Brown, Janet Reno and Clinton himself. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Smith, through the Freedom of Information Act. forced the release of Department of Justice documents which begin to give us a picture of the plot. Even more is expected with Smith\'s stunning court victory last week for more files from the Commerce Department. </p>
<p>The story starts in 1992 when AT&amp;T developed secure telephones untappable by the federal government. The company planned to make them available to the American public. Instead, the Clinton administration interceded and bought up all the phones with a secret slush fund. The plan also involved refitting the phones with a new chip called &quot;Clipper,&quot; which would permit the government to tap the phones easily once they found their way back into the hands of American consumers. </p>
<p>The documents obtained by Smith verifying all of this were so secret, even their classification was redacted. </p>
<p>The plot also demonstrates the way Clinton administration insiders were allowed to benefit personally and financially from the secret plans. </p>
<p>By 1994, White House aide John Podesta had been called into the inner circle of the Clipper project. Meanwhile, Podesta\'s brother, Tony, a lobbyist and fund-raiser was representing AT&amp;T. His donors and clients, including AT&amp;T, were invited to participate in trade trips to China and obtain valuable export deals with Beijing. Only a year earlier, John Podesta had signed a legal statement promising not to engage in any conflicts of interest involving his brother. </p>
<p>Hubbell was, as usual, a key figure in the plot. By April 1994, he was forced to resign as associate attorney general, the number three man at Justice, over allegations of fraud that would eventually land him in the pokey. Two months later Hubbell was receiving what looks remarkably like hush money from the Chinese-connected Lippo Group. The next thing you know, Hubbell was pleading his Fifth Amendment rights in avoiding testifying to Senate investigators. </p>
<p>About this same time, Lippo agent John Huang was given a top Commerce Department job -- one that permitted him to get briefings on encryption technology. </p>
<p>That same year, AT&amp;T sold military-grade secure communications to the totalitarians in China -- a move approved by the Clinton administration. In other words, such technology was safe for the jail-keepers in Beijing, but not for the average American citizen. </p>
<p>As Smith writes: &quot;Bill Clinton and Janet Reno have given the Communists the ability to track every Chinese citizen using advanced chip technology and back-door-like recovery systems. The digital chains of a modern police state to enslave millions of Chinese citizens -- made in the USA. American technology, shipped with the personal OK of both President Clinton and Janet Reno.&quot; </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Smith reports, the Clinton administration is trying to duplicate those totalitarian powers here in America. By 1996, Reno was urging the all-out federal takeover of the computer industry and the banning of any encryption technology that doesn\'t let the government in the back door. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the first target of the government\'s wiretap plan was its own Drug Enforcement Administration. Hmmm. The Chinese sought information obtained from such taps -- which may explain why Chinese drug lord Ng Lapseng gave as much money to the Democratic National Committee as he did. </p>
<p>It\'s no wonder Reno didn\'t want to investigate the penetration of the DEA by the Chinese. After all, Ng was photographed with her bosses, Bill and Hillary Clinton at a DNC fund-raiser. </p>
<p>Ahh, what a small and corrupt world. ... </p>
<p>Three cheers for Smith\'s heroic exposes. Shame on the rest of the press for ignoring it all. </p>

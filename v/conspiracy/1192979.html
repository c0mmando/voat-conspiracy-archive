            the very nature by design of "email" makes it "insecure". Anyone who is a state actor with judicial immunity can easily access a silly little email server just because it is there.

            They're compromised in the sense that she drew attention to the.  Guccifer and the "guccifer 2.0" person have both explained their methods.  There's nothing magical about hacking - that's kind of the big joke with people who understand technology.  Guccifer, literally a broke Romanian farmer, had no trouble breaking into computer locations that housed former presidents, the secretary of state, and other people's information.
           </p>

            the people making decisions about hillary and the dnc's email have demonstrated unequivocally that theyre not qualified to wield power in a technological era like we're in.  they've shown that they don't have the slightest idea what they're doing or what they're up against.

             That is what gets me.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even if the emails had no classified information on them, they demonstrated a list of connections, of people, and of methods of operation.
            </p>
            <p>
             For state actors, with access to psychologists, annalists, and good tools; this information would be priceless. It would give a road map of potential targets and places to go.
            </p>
            <p>
             As such i suspect that this is why the DNC was hacked so quickly. They knew who to hit and how to hit them. Maybe they have malware and root kits installed in key computers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DNC leaks are just as bad. They have a bigger road map of who to hit, how to hit them, and where and when to hit as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             regardless of motive or outcome: 
Cyber security is now the hot field.

              The DNC hacker claims he saw they were suing a certain voter database software hosted on a windows server and he exploited the vulnerabilities to get in, then installed a sophisticated malware package written by Russians that he bought for $1.5k

               Already a discrepancy in the stories. This could be the explanation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Did the security guys not know how the attack happened? Are they trying to cover up the attack, or are both these stories a false flag.

                The security guys only know that a russian-made malware tool was used.  This of course doesn't mean shit other than russians make quality malware.  You cannot conclude that state-sponsored hacking groups did the action based on the evidence.  In fact, claiming so is some serious saber rattling.

                 True. I am not certain that this is a state act. It could also be organized crime.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That is another possibility. That organized crime leaked some of the files, as a cover.

                 It is a nice chaotic breach to watch. They clearly are hiding something, as they are taking a lot of effort to scrub the wikileaks stuff from the various controlled media outlets.

                  well, the "guy" claiming to have done it says exactly what and how he did it and says he's not working for anybody.  he claims Guccifer as inspiration and he's a known lone wolf.  State actors aren't typically in the business of releasing their pilfered data  for two reasons - 1, doing so can implicate you and is an act of war, and 2, the information is more valuable if you have it and they and others don't know you have it.  individuals do it for the lulz and the notoriety - exactly what this person is claiming.  in his faq he also makes a political aside regarding Moldova/Romania, something that should be a clue as to his background.  my hunch is he is Polish, and not some broke farmer but rather a well-off person who thinks he's doing the world a favor ala Snowden, Assange, and Manning.  He's right on that point.

                   state actors get bonus money for these types of critical successes, further incentivizing getting in and getting out with no resistance.

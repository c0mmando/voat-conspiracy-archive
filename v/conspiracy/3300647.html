            Did he really say that? How amusing. However, I'm afraid that young Glenn is being economical with the truth if he says I spent years "privately seeking opportunities to write in [his] space." This simply did not happen. It is true that he asked me (and others) to fill in him for a week at Salon in 2007 while he was off, which I did quite happily. He also asked me to participate in a Talking Points Memo Book Club discussion, based on his new book at the time, which I also did. This too was in 2007. In 2008, he asked me -- again, as before, on his own initiative -- to do a podcast discussion with him on his blog.

            Then, there’s Omidyar’s sponsorship of virus research and food stockpiling in Hawaii that corresponds to the End Times predicted by Bahai found Bahaullah: “Soon will the present-day order be rolled up and a new one spread out in its stead.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The Universal House of Justice confirmed the validity of the prophecy with an epistle to this worldwide membership: “The old order cannot be repaired; it is being rolled up before our eyes. The moral decay and disorder convulsing human society must run their course; we can neither arrest nor divert them. Our task is the build the Order of Bahaullah.”
           </p>
           <p>
            As this next look at numerology indicates, the old order of God the Supreme Law-Giver is “being rolled up” in these End Day. Only then, through mass destruction, will the vessel of faithful followers deliver the authentic world divinity, the adamant and prideful One.
           </p>

            No.9 in Numerology – Yesod
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bahai inner sanctum has persistently obscured the meaning of the number 9 as an “Arab symbol for fulfillment.” No, the mystic symbol is derived from Jewish Kabbalist numerology as the symbol the final step before divine perfection. Number 9 symbolizes the sephirot (node of knowledge and power) “Yesod”, the vessel for action. The action is toward the fulfillment of the double-digit representing “Malkuth” or kingship, in the sense of divine-right monarchy. (Kabbalism and its extension Illuminism, has therefore has had an attraction to royalists and pretenders worldwide, especially in Western Europe .)

            Nine is strangely identified with the qualities of adamancy and pride that are the characteristics of Lucifer, the most intelligent angel surpassed only by God. The uneasy potency of this number, however, is limited to the institutional structure of the religious group. In fact, the actual ritual symbol of Bahai is the pentagram.
           </p>
           <p>
            The God-Lucifer dichotomy has earlier roots in Zoroastrian dualistic philosophy of a cosmos divided between the god of light Ohrmadz (Ahura Mazda) and his doppelganger Ahriman (Angra Mainyu), prince of darkness. This duality helps to explain the hostility of the Bahai founders toward Islam and Zoroastrianism, and their willing affiliation with the Illuminati and Kabbalist-influenced Zionism. To substitute Lucifer-as-usurper in the stead of God the good requires distancing from the fallen angel’s evil image as Satan, whose reputation Bahai has done its best to rehabilitate, sanitize and salvage.
           </p>
           <p>
            This brings up the question: Is Lucifer aka Ahriman, No.10? Are these cultists devil worshippers? To put things more charitably, the Bahai along with the Illuminati put highest esteem on pure reason (in rejection of the charismatic nature a and capricious will of a God who imposes tough rules on mankind.) Lucifer, without his terrifying image as Satan, is an adamant hero who teaches humans to be proud of themselves, to stand tall and not to grovel before a morally oppressive and restrictive divinity of the orthodox priesthood. A defender of reason, Lucifer can therefore be the rightful God of mankind to one who is a heretic deviating from Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition.

            It is no odd coincidence then that veneration of the evening star is shared by the seemingly disconnected cults of Illuminism and Bahai The historical links between these two cults can be found in Hermano Maximiliano’s “Freemasonry, the British Empire and the Formation of the Baha’I Cult”.

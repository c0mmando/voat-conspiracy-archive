<h1>An inquest will now be held over four days from January 7, 2019.</h1>
<h1><a href="http://archive.is/Hfaiu">Yesterday</a>, there was a pre-inquest review at a British Court at Guildhall in Sandwich, Kent</h1>
<h2>There were speculations that Spiers was <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1739663">possibly investigating</a> satanist Michael Aquino before he died while attending a conference in Poland two years ago, after vomitting black liquid.</h2>
<h2>Before he died Mr Spiers messaged his mother, Vanessa Bates, saying: \'You\'re boy\'s in trouble, if anything happens to me, investigate.\'</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Max Spiers\'s laptop was wiped when authorities returned it after his death more than two years ago during a trip to Poland to attend a conference.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today the court heard how the contents of his SIM card were also of particular interest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The father of two allegedly made many \'enemies\' in his investigations. Authorities in Poland, where Spiers was attending a conference, initially concluded the sudden death was due to natural causes.</em> </p>
<p>The barrister for Max\'s mother, Adam Taylor, called for members of the Polish emergency services to appear as witnesses at the inquest.</p>
<p>Sections from a 700-page docket of statements and evidence assembled will be translated from Polish for next year\'s inquest. Possible evidence over whether disciplinary proceedings were brought against police officers in Poland over Mr Spiers\'s death should also be heard at the inquest, the court heard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mr Taylor said that Mr Spiers\'s laptop was wiped</strong> but that it was not empty at the time of his death. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>He confirmed analysis of a laptop and a mobile phone that belonged to him should also be presented at the inquest.</p>
<p>\'The way in which they were returned and what was done to them is clearly one of the big mysteries,\' he said. \'The family has no knowledge whatsoever of what the results of that analysis were.
\'The issue is the Sim card and what was on it. Without sight of the report the family has no answer to these questions.\'  
</p>
<p>There were also a \'number of discrepancies\' in emergency services accounts about Max\'s death, the court heard.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>His mother said: \'Everything that we have in terms of health records before he went were that he was in great health.\' After Mr Spiers\'s body was repatriated to the UK, doctors at a Margate hospital were unable to determine the cause of his death.
Kent Police then launched a joint investigation with Polish police into Max Spiers\' death.</p>
<p>At an inquest opening in Canterbury in December 2016, the court heard how the 39-year-old had been visiting Poland to speak at a conference after holidaying with a friend in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, Mr Spiers was said to have been probing into the lives of well-known figures in politics, business and entertainment. At the time his mum Vanessa said she feared the worst.</p>
<p><strong>\'I think Max had been digging in some dark places and somebody wanted him dead.\'</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background info</strong> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Max_Spiers">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p><em>On 16 July 2016 Spiers died on the sofa at a friend\'s house in Warsaw, Poland. According to the Polish prosecutor handling the case, Max\'s friend called an ambulance.</em> <em>A doctor attended the scene but was unable to revive Max. He did not take steps to inform police about the incident. Information regarding Spiers\' death did not reach the prosecutors office until 30 August 2016, which was after Max\'s body had been handed over to British authorities. Due to this fact Polish authorities could not conduct an autopsy.</em></p>
<p><em>On 30 August 2016 an investigation was launched into the circumstances surrounding Spiers\' death. The investigation by Polish authorities is looking into the involuntary manslaughter of Max Spiers.</em></p>
<p><em>The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have commented that British authorities will not conduct investigations into Max\'s death with an aim to prosecute as it is the responsibility of their Polish counterpart. In December 2016 British authorities announced they would launch an inquest into his death, which is distinct from an investigation with an aim to convict (the role of convicting is undertaken by the Polish Prosecutors\' Office, who may choose whether to accept the Inquests findings.) A coroner told the inquest he was waiting to receive a report from Polish authorities. As a result, the proceedings were adjourned.</em></p>',

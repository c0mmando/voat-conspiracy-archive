<p>The purpose of this thread is going to likely rehash old information for a lot of you, but I think it\'s important to go over the many facets of how and why pedophilia is supremely important for a secret society.  I\'m going to also state explicitly that a lot of what I\'m going to put here is conjecture, as this is meant to be a thread to talk about the ideas and reasonings of using child pornography--not necessarily to show how it might correlate with current events just yet.</p>
<p>Let\'s start with the obvious, in basically every country, child pornography is highly illegal.  And with damn good reason--that\'s fucking sick stuff.  It\'s one of the most heinous acts an individual could partake in, furthermore it\'s dangerous.  Why would elected officials <em>ever</em> be interested in doing such terrible activities?  The easy answer is that there would never be any conspiracy about it and that a pedophile would naturally gravitate towards a position of authority that would allow them to harm children with impunity for as long as possible.  I don\'t think any of us are here for an easy answer, so let\'s delve off into other possibilities.  Myself, I think this comes down to an easy system of control.</p>
<p>In that method of obtaining a system of control, let\'s just state the obvious.  If an internet savvy person was determined to find it, they could likely find pictures of child pornography somewhere deep in the web.  It might require patience, and they could get caught doing it, but I\'m sure finding the pictures themselves is not an impossible task.  Not that I\'m willing to test that and get vanned for something that never would have interested me in the first place, but let\'s not be idiots here.  Once the pictures were obtained, flash drives exist, getting the files onto someone else\'s computer if you had access to it is also not an impossible task.</p>
<p>Do I even have to state how badly it could impact your life, an elected official\'s life, or anyone\'s life if child pornography was found on your computer?  The accusation alone, and any evidence of it, is enough to ruin your reputation permanently.  Later being found out that it was planted is irrelevant--finding conclusive proof it was planted could take weeks or months, but the accusation hitting the headlines happens much faster than that.</p>
<p>So theoretically, getting the CP and placing it on someone\'s computer are not impossible, and you certainly don\'t need to start with the elected officials themselves--only people close to them.  You know where a fantastic place to start would be?  College.  Senators\' sons and daughters go to college, congressmen and women have families, everyone has family after all.  Naturally starting a fraternity or sorority at Yale, Harvard, or other prestigious schools would be ideal--but again, I\'m just an average joe and couldn\'t do that yet.  I could however, go to my local college and start small.  I\'ve seen guys and gals in their 20\'s, 30\'s, 40\'s, 50\'s, and 60\'s in college--it\'s not that suspicious that people want to go back.</p>
<p>And all I would have to do is ask to borrow someone\'s laptop for a moment, plug in a flash drive, and the beginnings of owning that person are mine.  Hide the CP in a random hidden folder, then later on use proxies and a series of ways to anonymously contact the person, tell them to find the CP on their own computer, and then wait for them to panic.  Then all I would do is make them do an innocuous, stupid, simple task for me or the obvious threat of contacting the authorities would come next.  The activity they do is irrelevant, possibly slightly humiliating, it\'s just something to ingratiate them to me (although I would remain steadfastly anonymous).  To make them concede that doing the first task is easier than running to the authorities themselves.</p>
<p>Next it would be a progressive system of more and more illegal activities for this individual.  Nothing has to happen fast, I could wait weeks, months, or even years in-between each contact with this specific individual and task required of them--but it would get progressively more illegal in order to snare them further.  Probably start with something small &quot;obtain some marijuana, leave it in x bathroom on campus&quot; but done in a way to collect more evidence against the individual (for instance having a camera setup in that bathroom to catch them doing the illegal activity).  This would make it to where they are actually complicit in increasingly dangerous/illegal activities in order to increase control of this individual.  The inevitable culmination would be to force the individual to participate in CP in some capacity, then keep incriminating evidence of it myself AND force them to keep incriminating evidence of it.  Most importantly, a different person in the conspiracy would later also have incriminating evidence of other members of the conspiracy.  Only I would know everyone in on it, and all members would have evidence of some other members, but no other member would know about all members besides myself.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, I\'ve only described how I would control one individual.  And that\'s fine, but just remember I could just as easily do this to more.  Furthermore, once I have the one, I could convince HIM as part of his tasks to basically repeat the exact same process on another individual of my choosing that he would be close enough to do that.  My first victim would essentially be my patsy in this regard--if he fails, it\'s no skin off my teeth and I can begin again.  If he succeeds... I would then have someone powerful under my control and I could begin my campaign in earnest.</p>
<p>In this way I could easily create a machine that builds based on fear and anonymity.  The inevitable goal would be to create a cabal of powerful people, elected officials, party leaders, cops, military officers, etc.  Once the first person was under control, and they had obtained a second under direct control by me, I could advise them to find a powerful person all on their own to come into the umbrella but with specific instructions to never name them to me.</p>
<p>The only tricky parts that remain are a communication network, and the ability to meet with large segments of important members of the group.  With the rise of TOR and the demand for anonymous communication in the wake of the NSA revelations given to us by Snowden, I don\'t deem this to be an impossible task either though.</p>
<p>It doesn\'t matter in this way what my ideology was, I could start a secret society based on it like this, and the members would have no say so about it.  This would be a game played for the long term, but a patient man could accomplish all of the things I described.</p>
<p>And if I could do it, then so could someone else.  And maybe, someone already has.  All I know is that these ideas coming up over in Europe about the pedophile-sex-ring-scandals are disturbingly reminiscent of the practices of a secret society, and the public at large doesn\'t seem to be aware of just how big of a deal those revelations are.</p>

            This is really interesting and I think we probably do underestimate the amount of blackmail and coercion that goes in with people who appear evil on the outside but are being pressured into doing things against their will. I can't remember the exact details but I know there was a case of a a very rich Arabian man in the 80s called Khashoggi who played host to lavish sex parties for top government officials, who were secretly taped and then blackmailed into doing his bidding. He had links to the CIA, was implicated in the Iran-Contra affair and his first child with his 20 year old wife turned out, by DNA testing, to be the child of a prominent British Cabinet minister and Member of Parliament, make of that what you will.  With all the stories coming out now about Strauss-Khan, Prince Andrew and Epstein it seems pretty clear that at least orgies are happening at the very highest level and that they were secretly filmed, the girl accusing Epstein and Prince Andrew has just come out recently and said the FBI has videotapes of them having sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the linking of it to paedophilia, I still can't really work out if this is some throwback to occult practices and the worship of Pagan forces, which seems pretty ludicrous to me that the global elite worship Baal, or Satan, or any other demonic entity. Another explanation is your original one, that people with these kind of urges gravitate towards positions of power in order to get away with their crimes which I find much easier to believe than Satanic child sacrifice. But the use of child abuse as a tool of secret societies to keep their members in line is an interesting one, if you subscribe to the idea that these secret societies aren't even the real ones in power but are managed by somebody/some people who are even higher up the food chain then this explanation is totally plausible, the threat of instant life ruination is probably enough to get just about anyone to do just about anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said all that, I do think there seem to be a lot of cases where they are just twisted perverts who found themselves in a position to give in to their temptation, Jimmy Savile for example seems, to me at least, to have just been an extremely perverted man who used his influence to execute his crimes and have a wall of silence cover for him, it's no coincidence that he fostered a very close relationship with Prince Charles and also the Thatchers, of whom Margaret was of course the British Prime Minister. These close bonds can either be seen as a complete ploy by Savile to have powerful friends who could protect him or it could imply that these people were involved in the child abuse itself, considering Thatcher's own Home Secretary Leon Brittan is being accused (after his death coincidentally) of being a paedophile too.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all honestly I'm not sure how deep this rabbit hole goes but I think what is clear was that there massive collusion on the part of the political and moneyed elite to either participate in or cover up paedophilia, using their positions of power to exploit or silence victims and nosey journalists. So I don't think your idea of secret societies using the evidence of child abuse for control of it's members and their future actions is far fetched at all, considering all the revelations that have come out and are yet to come out I think you are probably bang on the money and even if the evidence wasn't actively planted or child abuse wasn't forced, if someone within one of these societies/political groups was found to be engaging in paedophilia (of their own free will) I have no doubt that this information would be collected, suppressed and then exploited by either the higher ups above these people or even their peers within the group.

             I appreciate your input, you've given me a lot more to consider here, thank you. Tomorrow or in the next couple of days, I think I'll keep going with this and try and show alternative ways I would create or take over a secret society. Also, I'd like to do a write up of how I could start a secret society if money wasn't an obstacle, or from the perspective of someone who already held a position of power.

              That would be interesting to read, I think you were right about university being the prime place for secret societies, you're still young enough to be impressionable and easy to mould but adult enough to keep the secrets of that society, then once you've finished your education your university friends are your secret society friends and offer you a cushy life of well paid or powerful jobs. If you want some further reading about the subject check out anything by Carroll Quigley, he was a political professor at Georgetown, an expert on secret societies and their influence on modern history and also the man Bill Clinton credited with being the main influence on his political career after he took Quigley's course.

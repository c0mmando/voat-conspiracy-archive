           Is it really a coincidence that a man who may of been the most powerful conservative/ nationalist Catholic in the world died in Texas right when the most powerful marxist, globalist / liberal Catholic was just over the line in Mexico?

           It did not really hit me until the Pope started attacking Trump today over his closed border policies. This is a huge globalist conspiracy and anyone who stands in their way like Scalia or Trump is in considerable danger.

           Do not forget that our last president to get assassinated was heavily involved in the Catholic Church as well and immigration was his main sticking point around the time of his death.

            Vaccines are not available without heavy metals and preservatives.   Give me one example of a vaccine manufactured without it.  You where given proven facts and you denied it.  your either and idiot or troll.   Viruses mutate to survive and their incredibly short lifespans and fast reproduction rate makes mutations and evolution occur at a much faster rate.  Evolution and mutations are all a survival mechanism have you never heard of Charles Darwin?   A pathogen isn't going to become resistant to antibiotics in a host that doesn't have those antibiotics in the system.  That is the most asinine thing I have ever heard anyone say.  A virus or bacteria cannot mutate to "survive" treatment in a host that has never received treatment.  What your saying is impossible.  You have no facts or proof your talking completely out your ass while denying facts.   Do you believe in the flying spaghetti monster in the sky?  Not to mention you have no concern for the well being of your community of fellow countrymen.  It isn't common knowledge that multiple shots with heavy metals are even administered, and your suggestion to the problem isn't remove the neurotoxins its let the 98% of the uneducated public become poisoned while the few trying to change it are ignored.  Have you never heard about lead paint, or are you just a eugenicist who thinks poor and uneducated people don't deserve to live?

            You do realize vaccines have never been double blind studied and peer reviewed, we now know that most are only effective for 4-9 years, we haven't had heard immunity since the seventies.    Vaccines didn't wipe out anything better quality of living and healthcare did.  Its people like you who can't take 10 mins to look up information for themselves that are endangering children.  Most of these vaccines contain unneeded additives like mercury so when a baby gets their first set of shots they are getting pumped with toxic amounts of heavy metals because while one shot might be safe FOUR AT ONCE ISN'T and heavy metals do not just flush out of your body instantly.  You support poisoning children who have no choice in the matter, why?  because if they are not vaccinated you could get sick?  How does that make any sense?  do you even know how viruses, disease and vaccinations are supposed to work?  If your vaccinated to a certain type of disease your not supposed to get it.  So what do you have to worried about unvaccinated people for?  They are not gonna get you sick your safe.  You on the other hand have a chance of causing the virus to mutate making the previous vaccine no longer effective and the new virus more dangerous to the general public and that is why there is over 15 types of HPV.

           <p>
            So to sum up there is no such thing as herd immunity since we didn't know vaccines wore off so soon until recently and they do not provide the same benefits as natural immunity[

            ], and while safe in single doses multiple doses of heavy metals that children receive now days are not healthy--the CDC admits 50mg in every vaccine and in the schedule for shots they recommend 8 shots some times.  That is 400mg of mercury,  TWICE the toxic levels in adults.-- There is no reason that someone who is vaccinated against something should fear getting it from someone who has it THAT IS WHY YOU GET VACCINATED why do you need to force people to get vaccinated then?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In late 2009, reports of faulty gas pedals, obstructive floor carpets, and failing breaks in Toyota and Lexus vehicles generated uproar across major media networks. During a 4-year period beginning in 2006, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) had reported 5 deaths, 17 injuries and 13 crashes, and an additional 29 deaths between 2000 and 2005. There was no hesitation among the networks and federal officials to demonize Toyota for knowingly risking the lives of people solely to empty its dealership lots. Even Congress quickly called for a Congressional investigation, and Toyota took upon itself the responsibility to recall over 8 million vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the NHTSA was collecting crash data on Toyota’s lemons, the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) database was gathering casualty data following vaccinations with Merck’s human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. And it was clear that Merck was far ahead and winning its race against Toyota for the Lemon of the Decade Award. Using data from the CDC, the vaccine watch organization Sanevax determined that, since Gardasil’s launch in 2006 until November 2012, the HPV vaccine was linked to 121 deaths and over 27,485 medical injuries of young girls, some as young as 11 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is something deeply wrong with a giant pharmaceutical company spending hundreds of millions of dollars to manipulate women and influence legislation in order to generate a revenue stream of billions of dollars a year for themselves at the expense of a gullible public. What is wrong with Gardasil isn’t just that it is unnecessary; Gardasil is possibly the most dangerous vaccine on the market, with the potential to injure, maim, or even kill the children who receive it.

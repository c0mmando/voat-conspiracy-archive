            Well, since you degenerate so easily into insult rather than making credible argument, I will consider this debate a victory and call it a day.

            He's flat out wrong. His world view is clouded by what he wants to see and not what is there in order to fit his biblical narrative. It's pretty simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the way, metaphysics is as bullshit as the supernatural. The natural world is all that exists. If there is anything beyond the natural world (super-natural) it simply doesn't exit. It isn't real. It's that simple. Similarly, Meta-physics; meta- (μετά-) meaning "after", or "beyond" physics. There is nothing beyond physics. If it exists it is a part of physics. If it doesn't then its meta-physics. I hate to burst your bubble but its really that simple.

            Oh, sorry I just got your message....

            He is completely wrong on everything because he is looking at the founding of America through a biblical revelatory lens. He is a Rastafarian. He believes, as all Rastafarians do, that America (and the White man) is the Great Satan as told of in Revelation, so he is fitting the data to suit his conclusion rather than drawing conclusions based on the evidence in a gross misunderstanding of the struggle from tyranny to an enlightened secular free society in Europe and America and eventually the World. America is the New Atlantis, based on a reference from enlightenment thinker Francis Bacon. It is based on the principles of the enlightenment and in opposition to the Old World Feudal societies of Kings, Nobel men, Priests and Popes. America is not a resurrection of Rome, it is the opposite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, Rome never died. Rome is the Papacy and is in opposition to the enlightenment and the invisible college of the Mystery Schools. He refers to America and Rome as Mystery Babylon which is a very important reference in the Book of Revelation to the Mystery Cults of the ancient pagan religions and the Mystery Schools. Obviously this comes from his Rastafarian beliefs as they believe that the White man (Rome) is a minion of Satan (ruler of this world), and Jah is one the true God. This is the source of the Rastafarian belief that the White man is often referenced to as the devil because of the core pagan inspired beliefs (that of the Reformation, Renaissance and Enlightenment) inherent in Western civilization.
           </p>
           <p>
            His talk is motivated by demonizing America because it is system of Freedom. Free from the shackles of God/Jah. He mischaracterizes every piece of evidence he presents on that basis and through that biblical lens.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example Franklin was in the Hellfire Club (NOT the Free Masonic Lodge of England a much older institution, although he was a member there also), which was a not so secret secret club with enlightenment goals like most other Masonic Orders to create a free SECULAR world order based on the rule of law where every man capable of asserting his freedom through his intellect and enlightenment is a sovereign. No more nobles, kings or priests lording power over them but free sovereigns; the literal equal of Kings and Gods on earth, in a society based on Equality, Fraternity and Liberty. No Kings, No Gods; only man. This is the basis of Freedom and Manifest Density where man is born free rather than a vassal that became the American Experiment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the things he says are laughable;
           </p>
           <p>
            That crop circle was created by a group of university students. There is even a short documentary about how and why they did it (look it up on YouTube). He mispronounces every one of the Native American tribes and mischaracterizes the relationship between Europeans and Native American tribes in an obvious attempt to fit his narrative. He misuses the term "The French Connection" to mean something totally different than its original meaning demonstrating that he doesn't have any idea what he is talking about. Every Masonic "fact" was incorrect or misunderstood. Franklin was not a "covert operative" for the French. The idea is ridiculous and a gross misunderstanding of his role in the American experiment and the entire climate during and before the French Revolution of enlightenment thinkers. The Helenistic references all have to do with the Renaissance Era of per-enlightenment thought. For example, all twin building are a reference to Gemini, the twins. The Muses represent all the arts. The architecture of America and Europe is part of a school of knowledge which goes back to antiquity and is celebrating those principles like Sacred Geometry, the Human condition, and our place in the cosmos. It isn't a Satanic conspiracy. Satan has nothing to do with any of it. They didn't do Satanic rituals or sacrifices. That is just ridiculous.

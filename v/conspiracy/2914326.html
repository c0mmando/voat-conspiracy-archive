            My group, IMS produced the controversial documentary, "We Need to talk about Sandy Hook." It was the work of 30+ individuals distilled into a series of segments narrated by the 10 individuals that produced them. Even 2:45:00 wasn't enough time to cover each anomaly, which is partly why it didn't cover the "free homes" theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of our researchers in particular did extensive work on the x-mas 2009 home sales. But what they found on that topic isn't the topic of my comment. It's what they found related to that topic that I found interesting and think should be shared here. This may be a bigger scandal, but I'm honestly still unsure if it's Sandy Hook Shooting related.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we were collaborating on the documentary project, 9 months in total I kept hearing about the free homes and evidence being collected. I wasn't yet convinced it was good enough evidence to include in our project. As it turns out, that question was put on the back burner when evidence of something else began to emerge. Eventually, I was compelled enough to set up a one-on-one meeting with the researcher uncovering the evidence and later began working to collaborate their findings. We soon gave the project the code name, "The Maple Drive Report."
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, before our work was complete we had our private Google Drive account compromised and all of our research material posted to the Internet. It won't surprise many here to learn that it first turned up on Lenny Pozner's Google+ account. That event, along with others led our group to stop using any un-encrypted web service and to stop working on The Maple Drive Report. We worked very hard to keep a lid on it and this was a total reveal of everything we had.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, research into mortgages in the city of Newtown CT began turning up indications of fraud. After we saw examples of the fraud were so wide-spread, we thought it would be a good idea to pick a single street and reveal just the examples on that street for simplicity. We chose Maple Dr., an iconic American street name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not being mortgage or real-estate experts ourselves, we sought the help of a few trusted individuals and one suggested we should use a basic set of metrics to measure the extent of the fraud. We settled on the "Fannie Mae - Common Mortgage Fraud Red Flags."
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't be posting any specific data here except to identify that the street in question is Maple Drive in Newtown, on which there are only 16 homes. After obtaining all the publicly available mortgage information for those homes we thought, how can we obtain help from un-trusted mortgage experts without tipping off the perpetrators of the fraud? The only way I felt comfortable sharing our findings is if we cloaked each entity with a fake identity. In that way, the evidence could be analysed without knowing "where" the homes were. So, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Real-Seller would become Mr. &amp; Mrs. Fake-Seller in our report. But before that, we reached out to some experts in the field to get a sense of who might want to help. Very few seemed willing.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, we discovered over 200 mortgages in only a 5 year period involving only those 16 homes. That's way, way above the standard rate. Second, we found tell-tale signs of fraud in how the sale prices of some homes increased dramatically in only a short time, sometimes in only a few months or less.
           </p>
           <p>
            But where we knew we were onto something is when we found very unusual mortgage circumstances. I'll try to map out a simple example. It would begin when Party A would sell their home to Party B in August of a certain year. But then, surprisingly as soon as September of the same year Party B would sell the home back to Party A. Sales of this kind happened more than once, adding to the unusually high mortgage total.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another type of unusual transaction involved a home selling for much less that it had recently sold for. For example, Home A would sell in 2009 for $260,000. Then, less than a year later Home A would sell again for only $170,000. You might think that could be explained by someone giving a good deal to a child or other relative. But in those cases, of which there were examples on Maple Drive the sale price is usually $1.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having stepped away from the topic and not knowing what may have become of the investigation by others, I'm still left puzzled. We seem to have uncovered wide-spread mortgage fraud in CT, not necessarily connected to the Sandy Hook Shooting event. It reminds me of what I learned from a brilliant researcher years ago. They claimed that very often two financial instruments are used in tandem to profit from real estate, the title and the mortgage. My memory is fuzzy on the details but their explanation was very compelling at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope this side-story is helpful in understanding what the scale of the problem may actually be and maybe in uncovering solid evidence of $0 home sales for Sandy Hook fraud participants.

             Same money laundering scam as White Water. The Clintons, Mcdougals and others were selling worthless swamp land back and forth to launder the CIA cocaine money. These guys are probably laundering the money from the child sex trade which would explain the differences in sale price going up and down, that's how much they made in that period. Just guessing anyway. Big illegal money has to come back into the system some way. Look at Alefantis, he isn't a millionare from owning a pizza place. He launders his kid money by being and 'art dealer' Anything that is intangeble and can be created by someone, is the esiest way. Some crap painting with nothing but splatters that he made himself under a fake name aaaaand it's worth 1.3 million. It doesn't even have to exist, maybe just the transaction on paper.

              I've been convinced for years that the art business (especially really crappy modern art) is nothing but a money laundering / trafficking / smuggling business.  No one inspects art crates coming from "reputable" art houses.  Art purchases are largely anonymous.  There is no intrinsic value to any of it -- just a price that is "negotiated".  And it isn't audited or subjected to any oversight, so it is the perfect vehicle for all sorts of nasty dealings.
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, rich people can't all be complete fucking morons who buy shitty art like this at grossly over-inflated prices just because someone tells them it is fashionable to do so, can they?

               Nope you got it. Another reason as well other than money laundering and tax evasion....The destruction of the idea of real art. Real beauty and real talent being hidden behind a wall of trash. They are satanists, they intend to replace/reverse everything. So they are taking something that no one can argue with, like gender....and making normal people confused about it. The turning of everything upside down. Mile Mathis has a good take on it because he is a real portriat artist with 'real' talent. He talks about the destruction of 'art' by these destroyers, and how it's used to promote "their" familly members, ie the artists, keeping the money under "their" control. Much like the large corporations. It's not like front men like Bezos, Gates, Musk and ZuckerFace get to control those huge fortunes. See how they all have to put most of it into "charities" like the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation that does nothing but push for the NWO by what ever means.

            I believe there is more to the story than we are being told and some nefarious shit is behind the murders of all these little kids. But, some of these theories are so ridiculous. Sandy Hook is a real place with decent people. Unless my neighbors are all Luciferians and I wasn't invited to join, they seem like normal people. Everyone I know still pays their mortgages on the over priced housing on top of the $10k in annual property taxes. Newtown Achools have an $80MM budget. Thank you unions. I have met one family that lost their kid and unless they are some CIA mind controlled spies, the family's photos of their little girl look real and she is no longer aroundpl. I don't know who killed the kids or why the government is so secretive. I dont know why they demolished the school right away or knocked down Lanza's house this year. Newtown/Sandy Hook is little rural town that costs way too much to live in. The grand Marshall at the Memorial Day Parade was a little old lady who owns a bagel shop in town. I really hope I am not living in some Rosemary's Baby cult town, but I havent seen any evidence. I must also note that a CPL licens e is a pain in the ass to get here, but it is still allowed and they don't turn a lot of people down for it. So if the government did this, they failed miserably and wasted a lot of young lives.

            I posted this recently on this specific question mark regarding Sandy Hook. I'm not dissuading anybody from researching it, but this specific item likely has an innocent explanation and there are much better question marks regarding the event.

             Speaking only from a technical perspective, a contractor or developer doing some kind of data entry job with some missing data or really bad processes might just choose Christmas day and enter in 0 as special values. Why do it like that? There probably aren't many houses sold on Christmas, so it makes it easy to identify the incomplete or bad batch of data with these special values. This doesn't seem like a smoking gun and the kind of thing that would probably happen often in non-technical or small or incompetent organizations. I bet many small township records all around the country have tiny issues like this that could be identified, the only difference is that the scrutiny posed on Sandy Hook caught this.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not dissuading anybody from examining real-estate records or anything else they want to from Sandy Hook, but this seems like the type of thing that would be super easy to explain away from a pure technical perspective, knowing how non-technical organizations operate, and how contractors work to ensure they get paid.

             Well, that would only make sense if they recently migrated data from one system to another.  If not, it would be rather odd that the homes got updated with a sell date of the same day.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, the coincidence that it would happen in this town where there was also a mass shooting and involve homes of the parents of the victims and have that particular date as the default date seems very suspicious.  It is actually quite a miracle that anyone believes that anything has a reason behind it and isn't purely chance given how willing most people are to just accept that -- like with 9/11 -- the stars just magically aligned to make it possible for evil to be triumph against all odds.

             Your guessing, stop it. There is no missing data, when a home sells, the name, the price, and the date are all known. The date is the actual sale date, which is the day you sign at the title company.

              As far as guesses go, a "non-technical organization has convoluted IT practices" seems like a more likely explanation of events than other possible ones, but I'm not ruling anything out.

              Have you worked with a bureaucracy? Of course the data exists somewhere, but everything you need is often distributed between different departments and might not get to the right person easily. This is bad in companies and worse in government. Again, this is just a guess, but this also is how bureaucracies always work.

              I think there's a lot of funny business with Sandy Hook. It is worth investigating, absolutely. Investigate this real-estate thing too, no problem with that. But I think this specific item is very easy to explain away though. It doesn't represent a smoking gun to me. Please don't take my word for it though and do any thorough investigation you see fit.

               A title company is not a bureaucracy, it is a for profit business. They collect all the info prior to signing, so it's all there when the info goes back to the assessor's office. The information is on the website by the next day. I have been through this process before. Anyway, the smoking gun of SandyHoax is officer Davis's dash cam video, it proves that there is "no" evacuation and he lies 38 times about seeing the evacuation. It's easy to watch and is the one huge smoking gun.

                Just food for thought. I don't really know definitively if this is correct.
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 The website didn't belong to the title company, but to the township's assessor's office. That's mainly where I assume that the bureaucracy and issues arose at.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Aren't you kind of assuming that every township process works the same way in every situation? Does it?
                </li>
                <li>
                 And even if it works that way today, would it have been that way everywhere back in 2009?
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                Again, I think it's far more reasonable to attribute this specific thing to "non-technical organization has shoddy IT practices" than anything else, but please do research this if you feel strongly about it. It seems like a wild goose chase to me. Dashcam videos and other documentary evidence like that, to me, are much more conclusive items to focus on.
               </p>
               <p>
                PS: Does anybody else still talk about Sandy Hook on YouTube? Just did a few random searches of good videos I saw before and it's interesting how deliberately hard YouTube makes it to find anything Sandy Hook related that doesn't come from corporate media. Everything is from CNN/CBS/etc when searching for Sandy Hook.

            Has anyone tried asking the people who run this database how this could happen? Is it possible records online get updated at certain times on a schedule? Is it possible there's a glitch in the system?
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice how the sale price on 12/25/2009 is 0? Seems like an odd glitch to me. I'm looking at Zillow.com right now.
            <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/59-Riverside-Rd-Sandy-Hook,-CT,-06482_rb/">
             The video only shows one sale history for this house while Zillow shows multiple purchases going all the way back to 1992.

               That is certainly true, but in that case, there would be glitches across the entire system, not just one town.  Has anyone researched to see if there were many houses across the country that were listed with a zero price on Christmas day 2009?  If so, then yes, we are probably looking at a coding glitch.

            If a YouTube video has one of those information panels from a (((reputable source))) below it, you can safely assume the so called "conspiracy" around that topic holds true.

            Why else would they so desperately push a narrative if it were self-evident to anyone looking into it?

            Ive said this multiple times and ill keep saying it. Sandy hook happened in 2010, not '12. Im 100% positive since i graduated in early '11. There was a single post on /pol/ from a Cianigger about this years ago. That the date would start being changed to 2012. Im sure somebody out there fucking has that

            Sandy Hook was so obviously a hoax that you'd have to be a moron to believe otherwise after looking at the evidence. What I've discovered is there are a lot of morons out there.

             1000's of compartmentalized fanatical diehard crisis actors going way back.  They could use them for things like 911 and the JFK event.  For sure they used them at the Las Vegas audio shooting where no one died and no bullet impacts or holes were found.

             I can definitely say Sandy Hook was a turning point for me.  I will forever be grateful for those who made jewtube vids to wake me up.  I have vivid memories of yelling "You have to be fucking kidding me!" at my screen. Watching the coverage was like watching Mystery Science Theater. Definitely one of the most obvious hoaxes to date.

             My dad blindly believes it and I understand why. I asked him, you don't question it because children died, right? He furiously said yes, that's evil to not believe what happened.

            <p>
             After that, I haven't tried to convince him for anything else, he's brainwashed.

              That is the same manipulation used when politicians say think of the children!  It makes me sick that people are so easily manipulated.  Maybe the masses deserve whatever they get from their overlords, IDK.

              It's funny that he says it's evil not to believe what happened.  Obviously it's not it if never happened.  The day it was reported my wife started up with how nobody should be allowed to own machine guns, lol.

             Not just a moron. But someone that allows themselves to be ruled by emotion. Theres also the group of people who have this tingling in the back of their head that yes, it's very obviously a hoax, but... they're more scared of what that means if they believe it's a hoax (that our govt is capable of such horrors), so they force themselves to believe it happened as the narrator says.

               The part that stuck out to me was how whoever implemented this was able to get work email addresses of so many people, not personal but work email, and some of the messages didn’t seem like they were crafted from a template, as many of them had different wordings and subjects.

              Clearly, the "real truth" is only found on a youtube video. This is another case where the evidence for a conspiracy is so absurd (free houses for everyone in the area) and so obviously false that only a certain demographic will take the bait.
             </p>
             <p>
              How many of you have personally researched this "free houses" claim? Have you talked with anyone in the assessors office? Real estate brokers in the area? Any of the home owners? The Connecticut Real Estate Commission?
             </p>
             <p>
              How many of you who believe this are basing it all on youtube videos?

               I didn't say I believed it. I believe that most people would never look at evidence because they've been trained to reflexively dismiss information contrary to the media story.

               Are you trying to say an obscure youtube video isn't enough evidence to prove one of the dumbest conspiracy theories? But I'm soooooo woke.

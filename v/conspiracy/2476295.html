            I for one actually appreciate you guys wasting billions of dollars on futile wars and protecting the opium trade. My heroin has never been cheaper, and thanks to it getting so filthy fucking cheap I got such an easy access to it I no longer bother doing it. Thanks America, you paid in blood and countless souls for my pleasure.

            If they would make it illegal to use Fentanyl outside of a hospital, and then stop the CIA from bringing heroin in, the "opioid problem" would go away.

            Insurance companies are pushing medications hard instead of actually paying out to fix medical issues.  My brother needs back surgery and they told him "to try alternative methods"  ie. Injections,steroids,pain pills.  They dont want to fix us.  They want us drugged and dependent on them.  When can we start this dumpster fire?

            This keeps getting reposted...  The opiate that's causing the biggest problem is a lab-produced synthetic, and doesn't come from poppies.  Blame the pharmaceutical companies that are pushing the shit.

            Government doesn't care about you.  The military protects poppy at the behest of the CIA.  The CIA works for the oligarchical jews.  Once you realize that it all false into place.

              I'd say when I first got to kuwait, the stories sounded weird, like I heard an lt was shot by an ANA guy who betrayed the isaf. Then when I got to kaf airfield, it just seemed like we weren't at 'war'; it just seemed like a vacation for a lot of civilians playing soldier testing equipment. Then, id say within the first month I knew it was bullshit,just not to what extent. By 6 months in, I knew it was all bullshit and we had ulterior motives

              A lot of guys, yeah. I don't really blame em, but it was too much for me as in I'm not a weed guy nor did I feel like kissing the army off. One of our medics (great guy, love you doc) was a superb combat medic and saved countless guys lives. They would piss test us in country and when he pissed hot, they told him they were going to dishonorable discharge him.... but not u too after he finished his deployment. It was fucked

               I meant if you're burning weed fields you're bound to get a contact high, no?

               I'm not a weed guy either although I get piss tested so I couldn't be even if I wanted to - which I don't.  I might be interested in CBD for combating inflammation at some point after I get out of the rat race.

                  Yeah, it was hard to accept but I got out as soon as I could. I have learned to separate my time in the army into different folders, so to speak. I enjoyed the struggle of combat and all that encompasses living in the shit, i loved the comraderie/brotherhood, and the anticipation and buildup to deployments and subsequent trips home; it has made the the highs higher and the lows lower. To counter that, the betrayel of my government will not be forgotten. We killed people that didn't deserve it (yeah, they were muslims fighters but that not what i mean... we shouldn't have been there) I walked through minefield after minefield for no purpose other than to justify the militarys existence there. I protected poppy plants so that my gov could poison and make addicts out of my brothers back home. Now i spend my free time volunteering to help homeless veterans in my state while the same traitor kike politicians spend their time advocating for illegal aliens muslims. Overall, i view the wars as a complete betrayel by a traitorous government. As a 19 year old kid, i was naive and i feel dumb about it; but when i think of the scummy politicians who laugh about it, or better yet, dont even think about it now, it makes me sick.

                  Last year, I took some of my civilian friends to the LA cemetary to show them the grave of my close friend who died in afghanistan. When i brought them to his grave, there was a recently dug grave near his, new kid was 18 years old and died somewhere in afghanistan also. What a waste.

                   There's a reason they go after high school kids - everybody is naive at that point.  You don't sound dumb at all.  At least you're channeling your energy into the right activities instead of going the drug/self destruction route.  Keep up the good work.  I do believe the fucks that caused this shit for the almighty dollar will get what's coming to them at some point.

            Trillion dollars a year crop, much more valuable than even the natural gas pipeline they put through there.  We see documentaries now like Narcos coming out where they now admit most of cities like Atlanta and Miami were built on money from cocaine and crack cocaine. Do we not think the same thing is going on right now with Meth?

             If it were produced legally it would be worth hardly anything.  About as expensive of a habit as drinking or smoking.

            <p>
             This is why I criticize capitalism so much.  We have THAT much surplus, but so many people engage in rent seeking (like keeping drugs illegal) to capture that surplus rather than spend that surplus giving us miracles like fusion power or cures for cancer.

               Alcohol was illegal at one point in our history.  Should we purge everyone that ever used alcohol?
              </p>
              <p>
               "Illegal drugs" is a bullshit term used to control you.  Anything can be used responsibly.  Anything can be abused.
              </p>
              <p>
               Look at Kratom for example.  For people addicted to opiates, it's a miracle plant because it allows them to kick their opiate addiction.  It is a VERY effective cessation tool.  It even works for Alcohol.  Yet the government keeps talking of banning it!  Why?

                Okay, from a philosophical point of view, sure, let's let people use drugs responsibly, and only remove those who fail the challenge from society. IMO, that would almost be as bad as our current plan, where the so-called "war on drugs" is a farce that's the worst of all possible options. Wait, surrendering, and just letting the drug tsunami sweep us away would be worse.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is an argument to be made that the fake drug war is worse, as it completely discredits the law and results in massive levels of crime. That's the
                <em>
                 only
                </em>
                reason legalization might look better in comparison. But the best approach is clearly to completely remove the destructive drugs
                <em>
                 and the people involved
                </em>
                . Those captured alive could be remanded to those FEMA camps, or perhaps facilities could be built in some wastelands. Simply remove the illegals and their substances completely.
               </p>
               <p>
                We'd achieve a lower population, and the worst and most destructive elements in our society would be eliminated. It's a (near) instant upgrade for society. Crime levels would drop through the floor in all categories. The non-criminals of our nation would see a massive increase in the quality of life. there would be tremendous benefits in all aspects of life.
               </p>
               <p>
                This might not be the best marketing point to lead off with, but the one of the primary advantages of this approach over surrendering is that the primary demographic targeted here is
                <em>
                 already
                </em>
                the worst and most destructive element in our society. Yes, there is a percentage of illegal drug users who don't rampage in the streets, but they can't deny they're willing to undermine our society for their own selfish reasons. They provide cover for the worst of the worst, both socially and financially. "Tee hee hee, don't we all do a little coke on occasion?"
               </p>
               <p>
                Anyway, that's my rant. No concluding paragraph.

                 If you want an idea of what the Darwinian approach would look like, compare Europeans vs Native Americans and how they react to alcohol.  Europeans already bred out most of the hopeless drunks.  Native Americans never had to tackle that challenge.

               After some point, every market is saturated and there's no more growth to be had.  Only squashing competition or value extraction tools like planned obsolescence.  Capitalism works great during a time of growth.  Once an industry has grown to fill every market, it turns rotten.

              Hilarious.  This post shows a real misunderstanding of how the world works.  Do you really think that if we got rid of capitalism and went back to Communism or Socialism that things will get better?  How is it exactly everyone seems to think we can make anything better by consolidating power into the hands of a few government officials?  That is supposed to create equality, power consolidation?  You really think that all of the people that got to the top of their field, the top of a corporation, the top of a government are the type of people to just take all that money and give you a cure for cancer? The only reason capitalist countries have the equality in them they have now is because of government checks and balances and a power struggle between corporations, the government and the people.  When government and corporations work together to rip off the people that is when things shift away from capitalism and into corporatism.  That is inevitable.  Just like it's inevitable that every single socialist country will quickly turn into a communist country and every single communist country will become an oligarchy or a dictatorship.  At least with capitalism, initially, business and government are separated.  It doesn't matter if a country is communist or capitalist.  We saw the Soviet Union do the same thing in numerous countries.  Empires are empires, regardless of what 'ism' they throw on at the end.  "WE" don't have shit.  The people running the illegal drug trade have that money.  YOU and I don't have anything.  99% of people didn't get anything but a heroin habit, an early death or some prison time.  The drug game doesn't change wherever you go. The wheel is always round.

               If the US was still a capitalist country we'd still be working 80 hour workweeks in sweatshops.  The US has quite a bit of socialism baked into the system (such as overtime pay laws) and it has greatly benefited this country.

                I am not one of these people that sees things like safety in the workplace and overtime as a horrible thing.  Yes, those are socialist ideas.  Yes, they've been implemented before with success.  However, there is a point of diminishing returns with anything.  You also can't discount competition and things like a ban on immigration when looking at the creation of the middle class here in the U.S.  When the U.S. banned immigration for most of the 20th century(banning Irish immigrants) that is when you saw a lot of the middle class flourish.  Think about the industrial revolution during the UK when the merchants were usurping power from the royalty and royal families.  The Blue Bloods, becoming terrified, started supporting the working class and worker's rights.  It wasn't anything done out of the kindness of their hearts.  It's just like the economic boom America experienced after the revolution.  That was due, largely in part, to white males who weren't of royal blood that were allowed to own land and guns to defend that land. That happened because Patrick Henry and the anti-Federalists marched(with guns) and had it added to the Bill of Rights, not because all of the founding fathers just had it in their hearts to give bloodlines that weren't royal the right to own land.  That is often how equality is created: a power struggle that results in setting up the board with equal OPPORTUNITY.

                Your paragraph about the Irish Potato Famine is equally troubling, as you can't seem to take into account all of the numerous angles there.  You had a country where literally half of it starved.  If you have a few successful potato farmers during that time, more than likely, they were about to go out of business.  They sold their surplus.  What if they didn't?  Then they go out of business and all their workers lose their jobs and they don't produce anymore potatoes.  How would that help anyone there in the long run?  Your point about U.S. Dust Bowl farmers is equally uneducated.  This reminds me of when I rented out apartment units.  People there, people who often did drugs and didn't want to work, would act like I had all the money in the world and it was O.K. if they didn't pay me rent because "I was rich" and they "needed help."   Had I let one stay and not pay rent, then more wouldn't pay rent.  Then I would have lost everything and a corporation would have bought it (ended up happening anyways) and now no one cuts them any slack.

               <p>
                You pointing out the perceived problems with capitalism doesn't justify any argument for any other type of 'ism'  When people make posts like yours that discount so many problems like what caused the dust bowl to begin with or what caused the potato famine to begin with and say "see this was bad and it happened under capitalism" when you and I both know that no one hops a raft to cross the ocean to get to a socialist country.  It is easy to criticize.  It's a lot harder to build something.  If you want to talk about the government clearly enforcing anti-monopoly laws to take down giant corporations like Google, Twitter and Facebook then I'm listening.  If you want to talk about curbing corporate welfare then I can listen.  However, I typically do not entertain any arguments for socialism or communism, as it takes an already over powered aristocratic class and makes it smaller, makes them even more powerful.  Again, it is and always will be next to impossible to create equality by consolidating power into the hands of the very few.  They are never, in any system, inclined to give it back.

                You making absurd statements like "if the US was still a capitalist country we'd still be working 80 ours weeks in sweatshops" is willful denial on your part and you're looking at things that agree with your viewpoint while not taking into account so many other things like ending slavery, putting the breaks on immigration, women in the workplace, technological increases,etc.  I understand you think this.. this is the best way and you seek information that backs up that belief and you ignore things that don't.  Why don't you take a look at a lot of other countries where people are STILL working 80 hours a week, losing limbs, dying in the workplace and literally being thrown out with the trash.  MOST OF THE WORLD still works this way.   If anything, I think the U.S. uses social programs like welfare and our immigration system(again full of welfare) to encourage the worst of us to breed out of control while sucking the life force out of the working middle class and poor to support millions of people that probably shouldn't exist to begin with.  I'm fine offering people work details and basic housing(if they will work) but walk into almost any Wal-Mart in this country and try to convince yourself these people are persecuted and don't have enough.  Then you take a look at most of us that work in these factories and offices, many of us 50+ hours a week, a lot of us take illegal or legal drugs to be able to put up with the misery.  How is that right?  How is that 'fair' that the working people's money is taken to ship in those that replace them, to support those that literally eat themselves to death?  That's the system we have now.  I'm tired of listening to overweight people bitch and moan about being oppressed.  We don't need more government.  We need less and we need a system that encourages those out there who work and are willing to work and a system that encourages marriages and fathers, not single welfare moms and obese Wal-Mart shoppers and corporate welfare grubbing CEOs.  This is done by LIMITING the government's power, not increasing it.

                 You clearly have no idea of history.  The potato crop failed, however other crops were doing just fine and UK was exporting those while the potato farmers died.  Potato farmers weren't selling their surplus.  This makes your other remarks about history (particularly the history of capitalism) suspect.

                 You're close.  The US welfare system is indeed terrible and is designed as a tool of control.  The modern day shackles that democrats love so much.  Keep people desperate so they keep voting Democrat.  That's not to say that welfare must be structured this way.  A UBI provides the benefits of welfare without the poverty cliffs.  Meanwhile work programs simply turn into another subsidy for Walmart and McDonalds that allow them to pay less than a living wage and churn out unproductive shit that our country doesn't need.

                  I have no idea of history?  You do realize that most of the crops failed because of the potato blight correct? You also realize the Irish had become heavily dependent on the potato crop right?  You also realize most of the land in Ireland at that time was owned by the English?  Those are the two primary reasons for the starvation on that island, not because some people wouldn't sell their surplus because of CAPITALISM. Irish couldn't fish or hunt on many of their lands. Irish could be killed for simply setting foot on an English Lord's land. That was caused by a foreign oligarchy using a feudal system of land ownership on the Irish  I can point out mass starvations in Communist countries brought on by NOTHING but Communism that killed more people than the Holocaust and you want to point out a starvation, brought about by a potato blight on an island that still had an economy still mostly based on feudalism to critique capitalism?  Are you serious? You also realize that land ownership is used no matter what your 'ism' is correct?  Whether it's at the government level or at the commoner level, it's always there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're criticizing all these work programs that ARE socialist and big government.  Yes, they work with corporations.  You don't think it works this way in Communist countries?   I'm completely fine with large corporate monopolies being broken up, especially these tech giants.  I'm fine with a flat tax rate for all corporations and an end to a lot of the corporate welfare out there but that's what happens when they can legally bribe congress.  They get a 360% return on all their lobbying dollars.  The solution is to stop corporations from donating to congress, stop Saudi's from donating and to stop the Chinese from bribing our congress.  Those are laws that RESTRICT government.   You can't give the government more power and ever expect it to turn out beneficial to the poor in the long run.  I'm in favor of term limits on congress and severe restrictions on where they can get campaign funds and donations in general.  I'm not in favor, generally speaking, of any kind of Communism and Socialism that would allow the government more control over the land than they already have and more control over the people than they already have.  Anyone who is, is very confused, the same kind of confusion that would result in them trying to use the potato famine as a reason why capitalism is awful while ignoring massive starvations that happened as a result of other economic systems.

              Greed (aka personal gain) is a very strong motivator and it activates the reward path in the brain.  Dopamine is more addictive than any drug can ever be.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Vitamin A has also been studied to shorten the duration and severity of measles infection. In a dose-dependent manner, vitamin A prevented measles complications, including croup, diarrhea, and death by pneumonia. If the government is going to micromanage disease, then they can mandate vitamin A and halt international travelers who are coming from outbreak-stricken areas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Targeting smart people who don’t want to weaken their cell-mediated immune response does nothing to protect the public. The CDC, the media, and government mouthpieces are blinded by their own agenda.

           <p>
            Although
            <strong>
             we did not find evidence that a single dose of 200,000 IU of vitamin A per day was associated with reduced mortality among children with measles
            </strong>
            , there was evidence that the same dose given for two days was associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality and pneumonia specific mortality. The effect was greater in children under the age of two years. There were no trials that compared a single dose with two doses, although the precision of the estimates of trials that used a single dose were similar to the trials that used two doses.

            Concludes on P3-4 that "...the evidence submitted in this experiment scarcely amounts to a demonstration of the value of intensive vitamin therapy in measles (but I suspect it could have done better)...The total failure to reduce the otological and cutaneous complications is disappointing (but I think if we tried it a different way we'd have different results)...
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary: "300 cases of measles received a concentrate of Vit A &amp; D... TL;DR: No difference was detected between the two groups regarding the number of cases developing otological or cutaneous complications.

            Just some general advice if the author of this site ever comes here: what you want to do when you write an article that supports a position is cite studies that back it up, not studies that say the exact opposite of what you're saying.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            One thing I did find mentioned that was interesting though was this: "After the virus is cultured and replicated in the aborted fetal cells, it is retrieved and processed for use in the combination vaccine." We know that skinny people can become fat after getting poop transplants, there was an article recently about someone getting some other side effect from another transplant (marrow?). Side effects from eating GMO's are allegedly bad, etc... Well, if the aborted fetuses are defective un-borns (severely disabled) and their cellular Biology is so severely fucked I wonder if viruses grown using their cells are any more likely to produce side effects when administered.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            TL;DR: This site should be banned from the site for providing intentionally false and dangerous medical advice to people and adults with children, all of whose lives are at stake.

             Appreciate your post and thoughts, however you could just as easily have bolded the second part of the sentence, and suddenly it doesn't look so bad:

            <blockquote>

            <p>
             Hmm...
            </p>
            <p>
             Another interesting thing, is that looking at another study by this same author, looking at secondary infections resulting in complications with measles:
             <br/>
             <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022432">
              https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022432
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             He says:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There was a statistically significant decrease in the duration of diarrhoea, pneumonia, hospital stay and fever in individual studies.
              <strong>
               It was concluded that vitamin A does have a beneficial effect on morbidity associated with measles and should be used as a treatment for hospitalized measles cases.
              </strong>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             We also know that Vitamin A deficiency IS a real problem, and even the WHO recommends its administration in such areas:
             <br/>
             <a href="https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamina_children/en/">
              https://www.who.int/elena/titles/vitamina_children/en/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              What would have happened if these studies were done on people with measles AND a Vitamin A deficiency?
             </strong>
             Were there such studies included in these papers? That would be a really interesting study in my opinion, but I do not know if something like that was included here.
            </p>
            <p>
             My own conclusion:
             <strong>
              Vitamin A deficiency is a real problem, and these studies DO give indication that this deficiency should not be neglected with measles
             </strong>
             . Does Vitamin A
             <em>
              directly
             </em>
             influence measles; inconclusive at this point, because we want to look at studies that have been done with children having
             <em>
              deficiency
             </em>
             , not just randomly administering additional Vitamin A.

              Gotcha. Hiding information among a clutter of turds frustrates me. The TLDR of my post was "fuck this site". These games of leap-frog referencing sources that reference sources when we can deal with the primary sources themselves(!) are incredibly annoying. Thanks for the reply. I was only aware of the negative side effects of high doses of VitA.

             Call them anti semites. The orthodox jewish community refuses to get vaccines, and most anti vaxxers are jewish, hence why you see it in predominantly rich leftist communities.

                Oh, I agree with you wholeheartedly. I was on mobile, and therefore just trying to point out the issue where he assumed it was rich left leaning areas, yet the majority of these Orthodox communities are some of the biggest welfare(and everything else involved) cheating scumbags that don't even try to work, so (((they))) are poor.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yet, many of (((these poor, poor people))) are shilling diamonds and fur coats down in Jewtown, then living in Rockland/ Westchester counties and saying Goys gib me da gibs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pretty fucking pathetic. The fact that their population is booming through all of this is even more frustrating:

               <p>
                THen to top it all off is the fact that they are buying distressed properties in Sullivan and Delaware county AKA "Gods Country". It almost makes one want to show Tarrant how it's really done, but I digress...

                 You blow up power sub stations. If you want to show how it is really done, you sabatoge infrastructure, and you do it dressed as an antifa.

                 The powers in charge of the left would drag every antifa out into the street and shoot them on the spot, just to make sure. Just one act of sabotage would freak everyone out, and they would back off immediately.

             I'm constantly grateful for the fact that both of my parents are completely race pilled (I did have to push them a bit at first). I don't know what I'd do if they were kool aid drinking, egalitarian liberals.

              I'm grateful that my parents are aware of race actually existing. My dad and I constantly make jew and black jokes while my mom wholly understands the health problems that can accompany mixed-race kids. Good luck finding a bone marrow donor for a mulatto child that isn't their parent or sibling!

             Long as they have a visa to visit, are gone in a month and we know who they are.  Anyone else needs to go the legal route to immigrate.
All other should be repelled at the border, or shot if they don't.
I have no issue with vacationers, they have money and the means to take
care of themselves instead of on the back of citizens.

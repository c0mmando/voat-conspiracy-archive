             the first thing to do is to have faith that I am an honest, that I am forthright, and that I have only one mission....stop usury....You must have faith in the power of collective thought....and that focused thought can and will effect change....we must unify certain ideology, mostly related to 1. understanding that shit is fucked...2. wanting to change that....3.understanding that as long as mass murdering usurers are in charge there will be no effect change nor any effect way to combat this global menace. The only power these people have over us is that they control the creation of currency and that they have estblished a "store front" authority by taking over the election process by controlling the media....AND THAT YOU!!! HAVE FAITH IN AND USE THEIR MONEY!!!....Leadership will not be granted by these people....leadership must taken from them by you granting authority to someone who will stand for you and stand for all....we cannot allow these usuers to dictate our reality by controlling it...unified and collective, even a small minority CAN effect change....we will challenge their currency and we will challenge their election....we will do so under agreement though unified like mined desires to no longer be slaves to a few men who would destroy the earth in order to suck you dry...I am asking you and everyone here, to bring people to me, so I may speak, and together we will make a plan...to eventually use me as the vessel that will carry forth the water that will break their dam....I know what to do, I know how to lead us out of this, the only thing I need is your faith in me and faith in yourself as well as your fellow man. Those of us who are good, must stand against this evil...I have never been able to stand for this, I feel as so many others, that there is nothing left to loose....so many talk of what is wrong, explain the details....you will notice one thing however...no one 1. seems to know what to do about it and 2. no one is willing to lay their life down in order to take charge of the situation....I know what to do about it, and I willing to take charge...I want no power, no money, none of that, I want freedom from debt slavery for all, as well as myself.

              I have no faith in their money--I do everything through barter and BTC. Yes, I'm paid with Fed notes, but those quickly go towards electronic components to allow me to build things that people need; which I then trade for stuff that I need.

               BRING EVERYONE YOU CAN HERE....TO ME....TO HEAR ME SPEAK....SO THAT IN TIME, TOGETHER, WITH CONSENSUS FROM ALL OF US, AS A GROUP, WE WILL FORMULATE A PLAN...
              </p>
              <p>
               the basic basis of this plan, without going into nitty gritty details is
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 create a new electronic election process that will serve as an "alternate" election outside of the media controlled LIE!....people will come, here, somewhere, and will register, be given an id...then candidates vetted by an online debate forum and process may sell themselves BASED ON THEIR WORDS AND IDEAS...NOT!!! HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE AND HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO ROTSHCHILDS...after the candidates have been narrowed down, the vote will comence, winners will be announced....these will happen ever 2 years....knowing that the first few times it will be in essence for "show" ....with the intent of creating a domino tidal wave where people eventually abandon the "media" election, and at that point, with hard digital numbers we will be able to show a majority....at that point the military will be given a choice....serve the will of the people, or face the consequences.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Hand in glove with this process will be, in conjunction, the formulation of AN AGREED ON WELL CRAFTED MONETARY SYSTEM THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND USED IN AN AGREED UPON MANNER....no "crypto" anon japanese guys coming up with some slick shit that ya really don;t know much about....no this will be THE MONETARY SYSTEM TO END ALL MONETARY SYSTEMS....WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BEING A GLOBAL EFFORT...A SYSTEM THAT WILL SERVE ALL PEOPLE! OF ALL NATIONS!....formed in a collective group effort....once the transition has occoured a dollar for dollar exchange will happen for those who have "honest" money...ie money not generated by usury, with the intent of creating calm by not taking away from those that have.
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               Money, what it is and the psychology behind it are page after page of explanations...those who understand money and what it is, need no explanations.
              </p>
              <p>
               There will always be rich and poor, we need not  discuss a discourse in inequality,there is no need to discuss the logic and right to keep what you have rightfully earned.
              </p>
              <p>
               Apportioned taxation shall pay for the services you need....your federal government will be reduces by 90%...all national debt...ie debt owed to bankers will be negated...all central bankers, their associate will be rounded up and be held responsible for their crimes. We will not kill them, as many would, we will be better than that, they shall rot in prision...Their empires dismantled down to the last file...ANYONE who helped them perpetrate this crime will be punished.
              </p>
              <p>
               The final intent is to have a global ongoing educational campaign that beats into the head of all who walk this planet what usury is, how it works, why it is pure evil and that it wll never ever be allowed to rear its ugly head on this planet ever....ever....again

                I will PM you tomorrow with ideas and questions. Thank you SO much for your explanations and your passion. IT WILL pay off; I guarantee it. FWIW you have found someone who will stand by you IRL and help with what I can.

              um I don;t really see that as reality....there are 465 members of the house,senate and executive branch, most financial institutions have board members consisting of generally under 40 people and the tech/telecom top officials that work with the military and implement privacy invasion are also a mere handful of people, so I'm not really sure what you are talking about.

               At least in America the vast majority of people are registered with a political party. So if you want to imprison all members of all political parties, that's most of the population.
              </p>
              <p>
               When you throw in all military members, then you have almost ALL of the population.

            The issue isn't that we can't.
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue is that we
            <em>
             didn't
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            When the Patriot Act passed, we didn't storm Congress and demand action.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Bush invaded Iraq, we didn't set off firecrackers outside the White House burning "1, 2, 3, 4, We don't want your fucking war" into the sky like we did with Vietnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were no anti-DHS protests. There was
            <em>
             nothing
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            And then, after all those years when the protests actually DID start, the police told us to stay out of sight in designated protest zones...AND WE FUCKING LISTENED.

            Yes, there is something we can do about it. But there's nothing we
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            doing about it. That's what we need to focus on, the actual galvinization en mass of the entire populace. And here's a hint: it doesn't involve petitions.

             By the way, "we" are here to not only conquer the evil that is at the helm of america, but the entire world....we seek global unification...and global routing out of the vipers....the military will be ours, and when that time comes, the round up will begin.
            </p>
            <p>
             there will be no racial profiling, there will be no thoughtless killing, no discrimination, no new "holocust" we are simply going to arrest and imprison those responsible for running this massive usury scam on the world and then we will establish a global DEBT FREE CURRENCY that will be the standard. WE WILL have a massive educational campaign that will teach all forever and ever about the EVIL of usury and how NEVER EVER AGAIN shall usury based currency EVER rear it's ugly head on humanity again....It will be on tv, it will be in the schools, it will be EVERYWHERE
            </p>
            <p>
             "THIS IS USURY, THIS IS WHY IT IS WRONG, AND THIS IS WHY IT SHALL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!"
            </p>
            <p>
             THIS WILL BE BEAT INTO THE HEADS OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION....
            </p>
            <p>
             usury is the motive for virtually every problem in the world today...a clean monetary sytem will not solve all of humanities problems....but it certainly will eliminate many them....
            </p>
            <p>
             there are no governments, there are no countries, there is no separation....these are figments that have been created for you...
            </p>
            <p>
             if you look at all your body and its parts, you do not think of yourself as individual components that are separate, your hands do not wage war on your feet...but somehow on a global basis, that is what you do....stop shooting your own foot...unify, globally, let evil be washed away by good

             The population is too polarized,  scared, complacent, and most importantly preoccupied to take part in demonstrations.  Things will have to get painfully bad before they get better.  Buckle up.

              So therefore forget about it?....the only thing the population is, is uneducated about currency creation....most people get mad when they know they are being ripped off, problem is most don't know they're getting ripped off and they don't know how....it is up to those of us who understand to show the way to the others....not by forcing info down their throats, but by simply setting an example.

               So my buddies were talking about The Super Bowl and I walked up and asked "but what about this fractional reserve banking shit, amiright?"  After I tipped over the trash can and climbed out I decided to fake liking baseball.
              </p>
              <p>
               But seriously, I don't forget...I think about this shit everyday.  But until other people are forced to think about it they will continue to not give a fuck.  I am just doing the best that I can to make solid connections with people and getting good  at gardening.

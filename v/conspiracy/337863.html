            That is why I personally believe it was the head injury, the first autopsy didn't mention it when we saw it on video that she took a blow to the head. It could also lead to the officers freaking out and staging this cover up, also it would explain some of the confusion and delirium that the person in the cell next to her described. Yeah it would have been cleaned up, but the fact that the crime scene changed 3 times and the second time they opened the bible to a bible verse to "prove" she killed herself really smells like cover up. (Along with the mugshot photo ect.) I don't see much of a motive for someone to go in and kill her, however I would see motive for the officers to cover up because the arresting one would be held legally responsible for causing the head injury. Some symptoms of internal hemorraging include, but are not limited to,cognitive dysfunction (memory loss, difficulty reasoning), confusion, depression, emotional problems, delirium. If you see what the person in the cell next to her said it seems to match. "She wasnâ€™t eating and when I did talk to her, she was just crying and crying". I personally believe there is a cover up, there is quite a bit of info and tanpered "official" stuff to sugest that. However I think she was slowly bleeding into her brain, (hence editing the trafic stop video, and the autopsy not mentioning the head injury we knew was there) if she was then they could be held legaly responsible for her death. Which would explain the cover up and the crime scene changing twice to match their new story of suicide.

            Shit I just spent the last hour and a half typing a long winded explanation of what I thought happened and detailing all the evidence I could then I accidentally hit the back button. Anyway I did the test that u/spacehuman and u/belight wanted and Yes twisted it could possibly hold some of her weight. She was supposedly around 6 foot and hung herself slouched here on this bar

            There is also some debate around if her paper that said she was suicidal was forged. There is no decent side shot in her mugshot and the front view appears to have been taken on the floor as gravity seems to be pulling her hair towards the "wall". (there is also some talk about it being edited I recommend looking that up)

            The top image here was taken about an hour before the bottom one. Msnbc used the open bible that is on a specific bible verse as "evidence" of her suicide. Afterwards this became the official story
            <a href="https://slimgur.com/image/0ji">

            that the trash bag is like this because she used an extra bag that was on the bottom of the bin to hang herself.  The story changed a few times along with evidence in order to fit the suicide claim. Oh also as u/All_The_ragrets pointed out (he says he used to be a corrections officer)  "In fact a trash bag would be contraband and if found with an inmate, they'd be in trouble. Also, any mention of mental health problems and they're straight onto a 15-minute or direct watch. " I did some research and it seems odd that the trash bin is even there as everything is supposed to be bolted down in those cells.

            is a bit longer than the "official" video that they say was only 9 minutes long (saying it is because it is motion activated) At 10:17 you can see people moving as if the video is sped up and edited as well. Also we never see her body once in the video, and at the end of it there appears to be someone still in there with her. Which makes me believe there is more video they aren't showing us if it is indeed motion activated. There is also this guy acting suspicious throwing something away
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTdohemd3v0">

            </a>
            (this is cut out of all the news story stuff and it also shows a bit more into the mugshot stuff) Also there is some testimony from a cellmate saying she didn't hear any struggle. I personally believe she might have died of internal hemorrhaging in her brain then they covered it up. (that or they just killed her for some reason and the person in the cell next door was lying) That seems to be the closest story I could come up with that would fit all the evidence we have. There are way to many signs pointing to a cover up of some kind with what we know. If she did kill herself, it would be strange for all the evidence to slowly change, and odd that they wheeled in and out supplies and in the news shots acted like it was her body. (the length of the trash bags was not an issue, the weight test though was slight stretching at around 35-45 pounds twisted, and about double that folded.) Seeing as there didn't seem to be marks on her neck in the really seemingly dead mugshot or blood vessels popped like someone who died of strangulation is one of the reasons I personally think it may have been hemorrhaging. (all the weed controversy seemed to have distracted all the news stations from the fact their videos don't add up and all of the actual suspicious things these officers did.) However we might learn more after the FBI investigation, we may not. We also may or may not learn a bit more from a less biased autopsy (seems there was trouble for her layer after he asked for a second autopsy and getting all the info from the first one) It is strange they say the ONLY injury on her head was the strangulation marks when in her arrest video we see her taking a head injury. (after further investigation the mark on her neck "is a uniform and consistent mark" which sounds like it wasn't twisted. Non twisted those bags would stretch at 10 pounds and tear at 40ish. Seems like a really improbable strangulation considering the limited room and downward force she would have been able to put out in that position considering her height. That is if it wasn't twisted before tied)

            Yeah but according to the video she didn't have to much time alone, yeah i know when someone really wants to they will. It just seems odd that there isn't a hesitation mark from repositioning the liner, nor does it seem long enough, the knot would have had to have been tied in front of her. Also that the trash bag was replaced, and that 2 different news sources show the cell in different conditions, one with a bible open, one without with her prison shoes near her bed. This whole thing just seems odd, and I like to come to these things with an open mind. I have seen corruption first hand and it almost costed me my job for paying atention to it (i wont give names but someone in the DOC commited armed robbery, another employee asked them to turn themselves in, that employee has now been missing while the one that commited the robbery retired with full pension)

            Hey since you are a former corrections officer you are actually the perfect person to ask this, everything is supposed to be bolted down right? Why would they have a trash can in there that isn't that people could use as a potential weapon? (off topic, why did they replace the trash bag in the can for the crime scene photos)

            You didn't have to downvote me thought for disagreeing with me. It is not a disagree button. Secondly I said I was going to test it. Thirdly the bag is only about 3 feet long max and she was in a slumped position the news said. She would have had to thread it through the holes that are about an foot apart with the top of the structure being a possibility (if she was 6 foot something) which really isn't much room. Lastly This is the conspiracy thread and you are downvoting to try and hide dissenting thoughts that go against the narrative. When going again the narrative and official stories is literally what the sub is about. Besides this isn't tp we are talking about, it is a thin plastic bag that I work with every day and said I would update with my findings, how is that not enough for you officer? Edit: clarity, the news said not the dead person.

            Apparently they are the cheap 2-3 foot long clear plastic bags, I will try the twist method but folding in half then wrapping around your neck and tying it to something doesn't seem to be an option. Edit saw more photos I was wrong on length it is about 3.5-4 feet.

            I will be doing a strength test with the bags they use myself when I get back to work. Someone suggested twisting for more strength so I will try both ideas and get back to you as well in the next 24 hours. (not sure it would be long enough if you folded it in half though, I would have to see how she did the knots ect.)

            As a janitor, it is highly improbable that she could have done it with a trash bag. Those things are meant to stretch, not hold a humans weight. Even if she was 100 pounds soaking wet in my experience it would not have been possible for it to hold her weight. Since the jail cells don't have ties on the top of their bags we pull a corner to stretch the bags and tie a knot. It takes about 10 pounds of force at most to stretch those bags and they cant hold 40 pounds of weight without tearing a hole in the bottom so we double bag sometimes when it gets heavy then save the bottom bag for later (we have to cut costs for their cheap asses) Even if it were the ones with the ties those ties still stretch and snap, the only deaths I could find even simmilar were people putting hte bad OVER their head to suffocate. Also considering she had fresh deep cut marks from cuffs it seems to me that they might have cuffed her (no struggle then because duh in jail) then they tried to strangle her with the bag. (as a side note if she wanted to kill herself the clothes that she was allowed to wear would have been a lot easier to kill yourself with)

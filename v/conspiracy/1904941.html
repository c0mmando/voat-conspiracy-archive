            Ive always been for individual citizens being allowed to carry, but this is kinda the cluster fuck I imagine when there are multiple people carrying and one gun man, and add in cops, it would just be a bunch of people shooting each other in confusion.

             That's what I'm thinking! How would we figure that number up? How do you get the police report?
            </p>
            <p>
             What if the gunman holed up because of some fags with guns, And then the cops show up, and they start firing on the fags with the guns? What if 40+ people were shot by cops? What if ALL the deaths were because of cops?

              You're joking right?  First off, I my point was hypothetical.  Also it would not be/should not be hard to determine who shot who. It would be simple, as I understand when an officer discharges his weapon he has to disclose it.  The department would have all records of officer weapons fired, and would easily match ballistics tests on victims.  A coverup would be the only way to avoid this, simply recording all gunshot wounds as belonging to the perpetrator weapons.  If records are public, people just have to request them and check ballistics tests, but chances are a cover up would take place at the autopsy/ballistics test level and would not be detectable in official records.  I really doubt that the victims had guns inside, as most night clubs and bars do not allow any weapons, and according to the report I remember, the shooter attacked bouncers/door people to gain initial access.  My original point is that civilians carrying guns would be dangerous in a panic situation.  This was bad, but if there were a bunch of civilians running around with guns it would be worse.

               Hey now, I'm not arguing for anything, I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to piece together the lack of footage and why they didn't tell us how many people were shot by the perp.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="http://archive.is/TVpqq">
                There should be hours and hours of footage;
               </a>
               but there isn't because the media wanted to spare us. If they have access to what we have access to, then it's all
               <a href="http://www.cityoforlando.net/cityclerk/pulse-tragedy-public-records/">
                garbage footage
               </a>
               . I'm dying here, it's so fucking boring to watch, but I'm checking this myself right now. The nightclub was for Puerto Rican fags, which translates into drugs (Which definitely means guns). And the shooting took place over a long time, with lots of exchanged gunfire without the perp dying.
              </p>
              <p>
               And from the reporter who went to the fancy presentation by the cops: "This presentation does not say whether any of the victims were killed by police gunfire. A police spokesman declined to answer that question Friday, citing the ongoing investigation into the incident. Mina has previously said he did not know whether law enforcement officers inadvertently killed any of the victims."
              </p>
              <p>
               They have dodged this question since the beginning! I'm looking through the reports and
               <a href="http://www.cityoforlando.net/cityclerk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2014/03/FBI-letter-re-records-requests.pdf">
                this is the explanation
               </a>
               for the lack of actual info.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm might be complete doofus here, but I can't find any real info on what actually happened. I'm looking through the reports and it's all a bunch of nothing! It's always the media making up stories of what could have happened.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, what's my next step for figuring out if there's a cover up if no real info has been released since the beginning? The autopsies are not among the public records, nor are the weapon-fired-reports.

                I see what you are saying.  My thinking would be to differ to cases like Waco or Ruby ridge.  My thinking is that it will remain an "ongoing investigation" as long as needed or possible to protect the release of information that could be damaging to the law enforcement present, or at least until the FBI clears itself of any wrong doing.  Additionally, keep in mind that this occurred while Obama was in office.  Comey is gone, and it is possible that there are shifts taking place at the FBI, and whatever narrative is being pushed, that is to say I think there is a chance that some info which may have been covered up may not be covered up if personnel changes or maybe the priorities of the FBI change.  I think its pretty clear that the investigation would prefer to show the muslim gunman as being the killer and the police as being innocent of any killings, historically it seems that things tend to favor the Law Enforcement Community in these events.  Independent autopsies and ballistic tests by family members or advocates of the victims would be the only way I can see the real truth coming to light.

                  Yeah, just like the others, Ruby Ridge and Waco.  There will be theories and speculation, but nothing will be done or proven.  Maybe an officer will come forward and make some claims at some point, but he would likely be discredited as a disgruntled former employee or a drug/alcohol abuser.  Its pretty much done.

               Every actual situation where civilians had guns the incident was over in less then a minute long before cops arrived.  The gun man would have died just inside the doors if he was lucky.

            How does a crazed gunman shoot 50 people multiple times? He was holed up in the bathroom! They covered up how many people were fucking shot by the cops!

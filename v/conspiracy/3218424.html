Fake accounts posting racist and prejudice comments to make voaters look bad in the eye of newcomers to the site and provoke violence or prejudice towards creeds that may be responsible for much pain and evil on earth
Real Voaters, humans who have been through real life situations and have intelligence that helps them draw conclusions that validate their feelings towards certain races.  Namingly according to data i accumulated searching terms like Nigger Kyke Jew Fag Tranny etc. </p>
<p>What is clear is that I hope we all here on Voat are aware of evil societies of entities or other beings who are currently controlling the people of Earth to some degree and implementing a multidimensional darkness as we speak.  The majority of comments I read seem to portray a common knowledge.  But the thing I believe that plagues some of us is the susceptibility to a clear conspiracy of the mind on Conspiracy Theorists (majority being white males).  Anyone who can grasp the idea of high intelligence, economics, spirituality, crime, corruption, war and the gods should in my opinion be able to understand that an aggressive or hostile stance towards a RACE including your own in a public forum perceived by all different people is a detriment to self.  They really want you to feel like you are certain type of person.  They are succeeding.  The emphasis i see in hating, for example Black People on this forum is often expressed with little or no acknowledgement of WHY a certain human during a certain era has certain traits.  Or for example, homosexuals.  It is clear that homosexuality or any “gender” divergence is from ABUSE or PERVERSION of the youth.  This is the key for these entities.  Literally the Key of David is sodomy in order to devestate the mind into disassociation.  It is outlined in the Book of the Dead and is an equation of matter that allows multidimensional access for the abuser and the abused.  In the current state this is so confusing for victims that they believe they have a “choice” without even realizing they’ve literally been fucked into feeling and thinking a certain way.  So how can people sit here and express this modern day tunnel vision prejudice towards PEOPLE who are born into carcasses unbeknownst to them in a world currently controlled by a perverse and dark entity without connecting the dots to the bigger picture?</p>
<p>OF COURSE FAGS ARE THE DEVIL
OF COURSE NIGGERS STEAL
OF COURSE JEWS ARE EVIL AND IN CONTROL
OF COURSE AMERICAN GOVT IS SATANIC / PERVERTED
OF COURSE REFUGEES ARE LEAVING THEIR HOMES
OF COURSE RADICAL MUSLIMS ARE VILE TOWARDS OTHERS</p>
<p>This is all obvious, and yes it is felt and yes it is real and yes you have a reason to be mad, but hello?  The dark entities MADE IT THAT WAY.  They want you to think that you are your body.  You are a TYPE.  But you are not.  To them you are a frequency.  A blanketed consciousnesses in an era of confusion susceptible to murderous technology and spiritual mind control that you may not even be aware of.  We know there are accounts on Voat and Reddit that make posts specifically to warp the minds of those reading them.  Are we really going to sit here with the knowledge of universe in our hands only to express earthly opinions of negativity?  That is what THEY want.  So if you know who I’m talking about you should probably stop wasting your time spewing bullshit and realize that Prayer actually works, this is not your first and last life, multidimensional entities control all Militaries of earth, child abuse and the rape and torture and consumption of the youth is the crux of the black market, there are multiple dimensions currently being exploited by power players of incarnation, and these same entities are trying to convince you to actually spread negativity about a 2 eyed ten fingered human being on this planet who had no choice at all but to BE.</p>

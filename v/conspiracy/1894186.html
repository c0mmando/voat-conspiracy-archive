            The founder of the Jesuit Order, Ignatius of Loyola is apparently a crypto-Jew.

            "When the Church was modernized, as though it were an old house or an obsolete railroad, many ostentatious changes in practice may have been partly devised to conceal vital changes in doctrine. Most churches, for example, were stripped of their ornaments and made as bare and uninteresting as churches of the most Puritanical Protestant sects. The Latin mass, which was impressive when well performed, was replaced with vernacular gabble that was tediously flat and boring when it was not ludicrous. Priests were converted into Protestant ministers, delivering commonplace sermons. Some venerated Saints were unceremoniously tossed out onto the scrap heap. But all these changes were relatively superficial.
           </p>
           <p>
            If one considered the new doctrine critically, one immediately saw what had been the cardinal and most drastic change. The attitude toward the Jews that the Christian god had presumably ordained for nineteen centuries was reversed. The change was neatly illustrated by the Cardinal who is believed most likely to become the next Pope. He boasts that he is a faithful and practicing Jew, and brazenly asserts that Christianity is merely a kind of auxiliary church by which deserving goyim are admitted to some of the privileges God irrevocably bestowed on his Chosen People.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was obvious, therefore, that the Roman Catholic Church had been captured by the Jews and would be operated in their interests. Strangely enough, this fact was generally ignored by even the most vehement adversaries of the modernization."

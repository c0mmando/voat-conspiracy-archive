            Hell no.  Bin Laden was definitely dead way before that.  And besides, he openly stated he had nothing to do with 9/11.

            Michael begins by introducing us to tonight’s guests. First up is award-winning journalist, writer and editor, Tom Shroder. His new book is The Most Famous Writer Who Ever Lived: A True Story of My Family. He is also the author of Acid Test: LSD, Ecstasy, and the Power to Heal  His book, The Hunt for bin Laden, became the #1 selling Kindle single on Amazon. Then after the break, Lon Milo DuQuette returns to the program. A musician and recording artist since the 70s, Lon quit the business to pursue his interest in mysticism and the work of Aleister Crowley.
           </p>
           <p>
            Michael asks Tom what he knows about the death of bin Laden. Tom believes that Seal Team Six did find and kill bin Laden in 2011. There’s no doubt in his mind. He got to know the shooter, Robert O’Neill, pretty well.
           </p>
           <p>
            ​Do We Really Believe this however?
           </p>
           <p>
            Lon Milo Duquette has been in the OTO longer than any other living member. He estimates there are now over 4,000 members world-wide, making it the largest overtly magical organization in the world. He is currently Lodge Master in Newport Beach and the United States Deputy Grand Master.

           <p>
            Michael asks Lon about the witches who conducted a binding ritual to get rid of Donald Trump.
Lon sees Scientology as “a dangerous cult.” They also discuss the Mormon church, pastors in general, and cults in particular. Lon says that every individual should have the opportunity to explore what might be helpful to them, even if that’s an irrational belief system. He shares with us that he’s know people who have spent time in cults and eventually snapped themselves out of it. They felt that the time was valuable and they learned from it. He reminds us that we don’t know what someone’s karmic needs are and what their baggage is. And that we can’t go through life making everyone else see things the way we do.

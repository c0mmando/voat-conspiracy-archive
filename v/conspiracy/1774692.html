           Hi guys,
          </p>
          <p>
           So I just experienced what I think is some serious censorship on this site. I would really hate for Voat to turn into Reddit, and letting this go unnoticed would set a terrible precedent. A user many of you may know called "NeedleStack" deleted my submissions on the Wikileaks Voat and marked them "YouTube channel spam." These submissions were videos I worked really hard on and contained information that was pertinent to the Wikileaks subverse. The videos had upvotes so they definitely weren't received poorly. I only shared two videos in two weeks. Those got deleted and when I asked why I was completely ignored. I posted another submission to see what would happen and they banned me completely. I sent messages and i'm still being ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I sent a total of three videos in two weeks and was banned. The third doesn't really count since I was already being censored.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm very cognizant to never come off as a spammer. I am only trying to enrich those that care to watch my videos with pertinent information in accordance with the subject matter of the subverse. Unfortunately, I have to share my own videos since YouTube's algorithm doesn't do me any favors, especially with my conspiratorial subject matter.

            Hi man üòä
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes I am a little concerned that such outrageous fuckery might be happening to my threads as well. So far they haven't deleted my shit like fucking reddit censors us, but I'm still very worried and suspicious. üê∏
           </p>
           <p>
            Each day that my threads or comments are not deleted --- I pledge to dedicate one funny Pepe the Frog meme in the name Truth and Light to be spammed relentlessly at our pedo satanic elite on social media.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like you, I am simply trying to bring attention to the
            <strong>
             currently ongoing
            </strong>
            biggest conspiracy ever perpetrated against humanity and explain how The Mandela Effect - pedogate - chem trails - ancient aliens - the NASA/SATAN Grand Deception - Jesus &amp; Satan - Isis &amp; Osirus - Cain &amp; Abel - Jupiter &amp; Saturn -the Devil &amp; Messiah - Hollyweird are all the same thing and that essentially it all boils down to the fact that our entire reality is a goddamn fabricated bullshit illusion.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is all a test. We are quite literally in a Play.  All of this is of course really happening. Yes, our evil satanic tiny dicked inbred elite are indeed fucking and eating children. But yeah, for more information please see my more coherently laid out rants here:

            You have been violating voat‚Äôs rules on self-promotion and spam (with the help of at least two other alts) by posting your youtube channel links across multiple subs on voat for at least a month.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I only shared two videos in two weeks.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That is a lie. You have used your alts CounterSpin and DearClaudio (as well as your GuyFoxicus account) to post your youtube channel‚Äôs links in recent hours and days.

             Voat‚Äôs rules on self-promotion and spam:
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Can I submit links to sites I operate?
            </p>
            <p>
             Submitting only links to sites you operate (or are associated with), without submitting other, unrelated links, is considered spamming. If you submit niche content (for example gaming videos from your own YouTube channel), you should create your own subverse and submit the content only to that subverse. If majority of the links you submit are to sites you are associated with, your domains may be globally banned from Voat. To be on the safe side, if you submit 10 links to various subverses on Voat, at most 5 of the 10 submitted links may be to the sites you are associated with.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The rules are right there

            </p>
            <p>
             Each subverse has its own rules which are usually stated in the respective subverse's sidebar. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Two of your alts (CounterSpin and GuyFoxicus) post the youtube channel links 100% of the time.

             So I wasn't lying when I said (meant to say) that I shared two vids in your Wikileaks subverse. Now tell me how many videos have I shared between both of my accounts in the past month? I haven't even had a chance to post 10 submissions. Please don't start ignoring me again. Unless you have some sort of issue with my content and are looking to censor it.

             I shared two videos in your subverse in two weeks. You're the moderator for the Wikileaks subverse, not voat.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no idea who DearClaudio is and I have no control over who shares my videos. The only accounts I use are GuyFoxicus and CounterSpin (like I told you in the message you ignored!). Both are saved on two separate browsers so whichever one I'm using is the one I post with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been incredibly busy making videos and working a full time job. I apologize for not being aware of that rule and for not having the time to share other content. I wish you would have clarified this or reached out before deleting my posts and banning me.

             Not an alt sorry wasn't trying to violate rules. I just happen to think the channel has great informative videos. I look through the feeds and don't see those videos. I won't post them anymore that is fine. Though for sure this is my only voat account.

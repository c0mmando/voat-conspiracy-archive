<p>It was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niantic,_Inc.">Niantic, Inc.</a>, which was founded by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc">Keyhole, Inc.</a> founder John Hanke. Keyhole Inc. was funded by Sony &amp; Nvidia, along with a nice chunk of money coming from the CIA\'s venture capital firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel">In-Q-Tel</a>, with In-Q-Tel receiving the majority of funding from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geospatial-Intelligence_Agency">National Geospatial Agency</a>.</p>
<p>The NGA was formerly known as NIMA, the National Imaging and Mapping Agency, until 2003. The NGA\'s primary focus is mapping Geospatial Intelligence, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_intelligence">GEOINT</a>. Geospatial Intelligence is intelligence about human activity on earth derived from the exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information that describes, assesses, and visually depicts physical features and geographical referenced activities on the Earth.</p>
<p>I checked out the NGA.mil website, the main page had an ad for what looked to be some type of Holo-Lens over a girl\'s face, advertising their magazine they publish. I\'m sure they publish that for all their employees, not for general public to know (although it\'s free to read on their site, just not a popular publication since only NGA probably knows about it, and the few people that lurked onto the site accidentally). </p>
<p>So Niantic/Pokemon Go is basically a front for Geospatial Intelligence gathering, just like the former Ingress from the same company (which wasn\'t as hugely popular as the Pokemon intellectual property, basically every 90\'s kid with a capable smart phone is out playing this).</p>
<p>If they need pictures for a specific area updated, they don\'t have to send any agents/employees. They just spawn a rare Pokemon and someone using the app will take some pictures for them...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/privacy/pokemongo/en/">The Privacy Policy for Pokemon Go</a> is a also bit Orwellian.</p>
<p>What are your guys thoughts on this application? Just a new Augmented Reality (AR) game, or GEOINT Agency wet dream?</p>
<p>A lot of the posts over on reddit regarding this have been heavily downvoted, which has a few users thinking it may be an \'actual conspiracy\' since the astroturfers are hitting it so hard with downvotes and comments.</p>

            The conspiracy is not that a government agency created a video game. The conspiracy is that the game is to psychologically prepare the public to believe in either a demon or alien invasion- neither of which is true of course. In order to push a one world government, they need an enemy the entire world could unite against- see project Blue Beam.
           </p>
           <p>
            This game is just preparing people's minds for that future false flag.

            more like "i already have full-blown painful cancer all over my body, why the fuck would i care if i stubbed my toe"
           </p>
           <p>
            i preluded my comment with "i feel ya" meaning i agree that it sucks. i was just pointing out the fact that sitting around bitching about it isn't going to fix it, and i doubt any faggot-ass voater is going to try to figure out a legitimate solution to it
           </p>
           <p>
            but thanks for deflecting the blame of this situation to the one practical/sane/honest/logical person on this cancerfaggot circlejerk. it's totally my fault for not grabbing my sling and running down to the frontlines while you HEROES continue to protect privacy here in voat comments. 😂

            I knew immediately when I first heard of Pokemon go that this was used for spying since google is involved,but I don't really care about that it's the closest I have to my childhood dream of having a pokemon. Plus you can't really blame the phone if the kids are addicted to it.

            Its a good theory, we should continue to build on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a side note, I think the blowback when mentioning this theory probably comes from the people who like the game, rather than payed astroturf. Which is even more ingenius, as they have intel and PR built into a single crowd-source platform.

             Until the game characters are on the bench, windowsill, roof, car, etc. Now peeps will willingly snap a photo of your car (which may include license plate numbers) for a game.

            <p>
             So basically everyone playing the game is a surveillance tool.

            Yep, the whole thing was incredible fucked up. She was abused for years by her parents, and she finally got to go on a vacation. She is a very nice person, but you can tell that all of the things she has gone threw has taken it's toll on her mentally.

            To me it's just common to all these sharing based apps/games. Pokémon Go is more icing on the cake.

            You could even get multiple pictures in the same location at different times of day without sitting an agent in a van all day.  If you are a drug dealer and find a bunch of people snapping pictures on the outside of your house don't be suprised if their's a pokemon on your property.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course this isn't really for drug dealers.  This is for forign embases.  This isn't just in the US.  I'm sure they are loving all the pictures they will get out of Europe.

            Downside is a counter-intellegence angle.  If you're the bad guy and are smart enough to keep up with pokemon-go (what vilian doesn't have at least one employee that plays the game), you can tell that your location is of interest and when it became of interest which has counter-intellegence value because you then get to consider how and when they came to knowing.  Having a plain dressed agent go by in running clothes with no pokemon doesn't leak that you have intel on them.

             So Niantic/Pokemon Go is basically a front for Geospatial Intelligence gathering, just like the former Ingress from the same company (which wasn't as hugely popular as the Pokemon intellectual property, basically every 90's kid with a capable smart phone is out playing this).

            Your idea falls apart when you know that they use Google to get their data and Google already has that data.

             If they need pictures for a specific area updated, they don't have to send any agents/employees. They just spawn a rare Pokemon and someone using the app will take some pictures for them...

            Except these "rare" pokemon would be in areas where tons of people go every day which has tons of pictures.

               Which was what? That Google already has it covered? That they don't need this technology because people are always taking pictures and the random selfies in bathrooms and parks which show 10% background are somehow better than aiming your camera phone at a random landscape wherever they want to spawn these things?

               I live in a remote area &amp; got asked around 1AM on a Sunday Night / Monday if I found the nearby Snorlax when I went out for a little late night exercise, normally I don't see anyone out around that time of night besides myself on my street. I'm sure this won't be the last time, just seems dangerous to have people buried in their phones on bikes/longboards/walking etc. down desolate streets and shit.

                Did you play the game at all? Your premise falls apart when you realize that the people don't actually need to be directly next to the rare spawn. And when you are "catching" it, it's usually on the ground and it shows your current camera, if you tap the pokemon with your phone facing down on a flat surface the pokemon will appear in front of a black screen. Any photos harvested from this game would be completely useless for anything besides entertainment

                 Google Maps car drives around from the middle of the street taking pictures, maybe pulling into a couple parking lots here &amp; there. Some areas aren't even mapped in street view. Have you ever pulled up the 3D view? Most of the images are pretty shitty when you zoom all the way in, you can't see much physical terrain features as it's all relatively 2D still. I'm sure that needs a good updating, aiming the phones at the ground would be great for updating the geography.

                 And if you read the article I linked you'd see that the CEO of Niantic, Inc. (Pokemon Go's developers) has deep relations with Google, and was the product manager for Google Maps.

                 I'm sure they are using it for far more than just aiming your camera &amp; swiping Pokemon.

                   Whether Snorlax is rare or not isn't relevant to my point (that there are now random people creeping around my house at all hours of the day to catch Pokemon, when it was relatively quiet a week ago).

                   Talking about 3D View (Ctrl-Drag from maps.google.com), not Street View or satellite imagery which are both fixed point capture vehicles (the camera is stationary on a vehicle moving through neighborhoods perched at different angles whenever they decide to bring the fleet out, or in outerspace with a birds-eye view). Buildings/cars/trees have blobs for shapes but you can tell what they are, they resemble the object but they aren't highly detailed. You'd need many multiple camera angles to produce a true three dimensional view using photography.

                     Whether Snorlax is rare or not isn't relevant to my point (that there are now random people creeping around my house at all hours of the day to catch Pokemon, when it was relatively quiet a week ago).

                    It relates to the point of them placing a "rare" pokemon. If it was a "rare" it would be in an area where pictures are being taken. Now you are just changing your argument.

                     Talking about 3D View (Ctrl-Drag from maps.google.com), not Street View or satellite imagery which are both fixed point capture vehicles (the camera is stationary on a vehicle moving through neighborhoods perched at different angles whenever they decide to bring the fleet out, or in outerspace with a birds-eye view). Buildings/cars/trees have blobs for shapes but you can tell what they are, they resemble the object but they aren't highly detailed. You'd need many multiple camera angles to produce a true three dimensional view using photography.

             Me and my cousin went out a bit after midnight to get a quick skate session in, it was weird seeing someone else on my street at 12:45AM asking if we caught a Snorlax, being the only house on the block (I live in a relatively quiet area, usually you don't see anyone).
            </p>
            <p>
             I guess the Pokemon spawns are time sensitive, so different types spawn in different times of day, or different weather conditions.

            Well, just following the money-trail alone already raises a few red flags. It's a very clever way of gathering intelligence, right from under people's noses that they willingly give.

            Any sources for the company connections at the beginning?  I'd like to spread this but I need a bit more dots connected before I feel confident in this one.
           </p>
           <p>
            If nothing else, it's a data farm for GPS data that they probably sell off to some company, but it's almost certainly more than that.
They're also shilling it aggressively as fuck on Reddit, but that could just be to push profits because the game has microtransaction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Either way, this boring-ass game is cancer and I hope it flops soon so I can stop hearing about the shit and seeing people roam around like retards.

              Initially launched as a spin-off of Intrinsic Graphics, first round funding came from a Sony venture capital fund and others, additional capital came from an NVIDIA bundling deal, from the CIA's venture capital arm In-Q-Tel,[1] with the majority of In-Q-Tel' funds coming from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency[2]

             Broken link from 2005 describing In-Q-Tel (maybe had a Keyhole Inc. mention? I don't know but unfortunately that's the link from the In-Q-Tel connection, but we're talking about intelligence agencies; I'm sure they can erase an obscure page from the web), back before Bloomberg bought out Business Week and the site/servers changed? Not sure but the Wayback machine didn't archive it, I tried pulling up on archive.org:

             From previous source:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              These negotiations had to do with Google's purchase of Keyhole, a tiny tech startup that developed 3-D mapping technology. The company's main product was an application called EarthViewer, which allowed users to fly and move around a virtual globe as if they were in a video game. Google purchased Keyhole in 2004 for an undisclosed sum, and folded its technology into what later became known as Google Earth.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time, Google's acquisition of Keyhole raised serious privacy concerns. The reason was simple: In 2003, just a year before Google bought Keyhole, the company was saved from bankruptcy by In-Q-Tel, a venture capital fund run by the CIA on behalf of the military and intelligence community. Until the CIA came along, Keyhole was on the brink of bankruptcy and was reduced to giving its software away for free to CNN in exchange for promotion and hawking it at real estate conventions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although the exact amount that In-Q-Tel invested into Keyhole is classified. What we do know is that the bulk of the funds didn't come from the CIA's intelligence budget — as they normally do with In-Q-Tel — but from the NGA, which provided the money on behalf of the entire "Intelligence Community." As a result, equity in Keyhole was held by two major intelligence agencies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keyhole's new investors did not sit on the sidelines, but aggressively involved themselves in the operation and evolution of the business. This was no secret. The CIA publicly discussed its involvement, writing on its promotional materials that the agency "worked closely with other Intelligence Community organizations to tailor Keyhole’s systems to meet their needs."

              Playing with AR on drains your battery much faster and it makes the game more difficult. People turn off AR as soon as they figure out they can do it.

             this. the premise behind pokemongo seemed sketchy, but i'm not sure i care if the government collects data anymore.

              I care simply because in America literally everything is a crime. I don't want them to have any more ammo to fuck over the population with.

              I knew a girl who posted a beach picture on CIAbook, and she wasn't aware that a nipple was showing, unfortunately for her she was 15 and a relative reported her for kiddie porn. She almost had her life completely ruined by the government.

                no one is going to do anything to stop them... they could reveal that they had mosquito cameras in everyone's showers and no one would do anything. it's not like we can grab our muskets and have a revolt vs a well-funded/trained high-tech military... every NSA agent could go door-to-door taking turns fucking your children in front of you and all you could do is cry into your cum towel
               </li>
               <li>
                it's just another pebble on the mountain. they already track every move you make via your smart phone's gps. big fucking deal if they start associating pictures with gps location.

            Yes and it's working.  Voat has a reputation for being full of racist bigotry that image seems quite persistent.  "True" internet hate, like FPH, was silly stuff done in jest.  It was for the lulz.  Done more in the style of comedians doing their racist skits.  The crap I see on voat is just boring and uninteresting use of slurs.  Feels too forced.

            Absolutely, and as a member of voat I'm somewhat surprised this is news to you.

            Astroturfing, disinfo, and shilling have been going on for a few years now and have worked wonders(look at reddit). From turning congregations of free thinkers and hobbiests into channels for advertising and censorship. The jidf has admitted to using their tactics on "chans"  and I can guarantee you've seen some form of propaganda from them, and others, if you've spent anytime on social media or reddit and the like.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a really depressing thought and when you start to notice this you kind of lose the fun reading things anywhere on the Internet. Every buzz feed/the onion article subtly pushes an agenda whether it be liberal or social justice(I'd say others, but I haven't seen them) whether it be "we replaced Republicans holding guns with dildos"  or "10 different hairstyles from the same day with Donald Trump". The titles sometimes give it away, but the articles content is the true proof in the pudding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anytime I see something posted I have to ask the "who/what/wht?".  Why was this written, whom is the target audience, what is the message. I remember being younger and taking everything at face value, ignorance was bliss.

             Voat is the only social media-ish thing I use; I have generally stayed off the internet aside from using it for research purposes, so peer-reviewed journals and the like. I started doing all of this mainly because I was getting tired of the direction I was seeing the world around me go (plummeting downhill) and enjoyed discussing it openly, something I was missing otherwise. I'm super late to the game as far as this all goes, so maybe I'm just catching on to how bad it all is as I actually begin to interact with it more and more. And that kind of sucks; what the fuck kind of hope do new generations have? This is the state of things and they are just getting here. They're way to young to be able to process all of this. It's not a damn wonder the SJW side of things spreads so easily, they're piggybacking on kids who don't have a clue and just want to fit in. Honestly, half the time I can't even tell if something is real or just convincing satire that forgot to be funny because people are only filling to take creativity so far.

             So basically we invented a literal fucking miracle and managed to fuck it up before most people got to experience it? I feel like someone had to have written a proverb about us doing this at some point in history.

              But in all seriousness you're correct. A lot of the reason things end up working out so easily for sjws and liberals has a lot to do with 
A.  The age of their demographic they attract 
B. The general intellect of said targets
And 
C. Mob mentality
             </p>
             <p>
              It's nearly identical of the social democratic workers group that took place post ww2 in Europe. Perhaps, worse. People have unlimited reach of influence, and now even more mediums to help. On top of that, there is a very us vrs them mentality that's presented, only "them"  usually isn't allowed/able to protect themselves, and anyone part of the "us" (sjw) camp speaks against the majority, they to, will end up with the thems.

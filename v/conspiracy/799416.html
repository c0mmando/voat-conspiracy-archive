Why is it still around?<br />
I thought that it was a failed version of Facebook, but I was wrong.<br />
This thing is far from failed.  
</p>
<p>But let\'s start from the beginning...<br />
There was a post here 20 days ago about a <a href="https://np.redd.it/3yngnf">Compilation of Hillary Clinton Invoking 9/11</a>.<br />
So, just a day after the video was pubished there there was this weird comment mixed among other comments.<br />
Many were clearly from reddit, so I assumed it this funny comment    was made by a troll from reddit, I was wrong.<br />
The user was called <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qYtuotV.png">Padmini Bhat</a> and she said &quot;Hillary Clinton is a good woman &amp; good politician for the people.<br />
She had 718 subscribers and zero videos.<br />
So I dug deeper.<br />
She had a <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cMwnX">G+ account</a> where she reposted/shared a lot of stuff with &quot;unique&quot; phrases.<br />
Ten days after I saw this I went to check that account, but she had changed her name to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xZFxmRA.png">P. D. Damodara</a>.<br />
Now she has changed her name again to <a href="https://plus.google.com/102487481033725980000/posts">Padmini Domadara</a>.  
</p>
<p>As you can tell by now I believe that she is not a real person.<br />
I believe she is a badly written bot and if you look at the evidence you will agree.<br />
1- She only had 2 kinds of content: Fluff and Politician PR<br />
2- She is very repetitive with her words like &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;nice&quot;<br />
3- It looks like this bot understands the content of what it is posting and creates phrases based on other comments and a simple A.I. algorithm.<br />
4- When the bot is concatenating several parts of a comment it usually uses &quot;&amp;&quot; instead of &quot;,&quot; or &quot;and&quot;.<br />
5- This &quot;person&quot; has lots of youtuber subscribers for no apparent reason (a number which is always slowly increasing).<br />
6- Here\'s a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/76XvZ4Q.png">Venn Diagram</a> making my point clear.  
</p>
<p>So now that we agree that this person is most likely a bot/shill lets move on a bit further.   
</p>
<p>What is G+?  
</p>
<p>G+ is a social media designed to mine data (in this case other people\'s comments) in order to sell &quot;services&quot; to several people who want to have a certain image of themselves on the internet.  
</p>
<p>Imagine you could literally pay to have 90% of your google search magically switched to positive reviews of you, or your product, or anything you want really.<br />
We can literally change reality.<br />
We can also make life very hard for your competitors.<br />
G+ is a successful business of creating reality.</p>',

            I was just explaining these bots in another comment.  If enough of us banned together and each bought bots/proxies/account creation bots, then we could return their propaganda back to them.  I think I'm going to eventually make a post about this.  These shill bots are definitely not a conspiracy, but a fact.  Good job spotting one.

             Sorry I didn't make that clear.
             <br/>
             The inicial conspiracy was a shillary bot commenting on youtube within the first 24h of it being uploaded.
             <br/>
             Then I kinda went on a tangent and saw a pattern that would be generalized to other shadier things G+ can do.

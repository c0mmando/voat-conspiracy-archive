            <a href="http://rense.com/general94/fulfordfuku.htm">
             Fulford's claim
            </a>
            that it was triggered by an underwater nuke. And a recent post corroborating that the idea has been considered at weapons labs that we could
            <a href="https://youtu.be/g_b754SzLcU">
             trigger a tsunami with an underwater hydrogen bomb.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            All that aside, I remember reports of flashes of light in the ionosphere immediately preceding the earthquake, which lends credece to the HAARP story. Can't find a source offhand for that though.

            this is just incredibly ridiculous. this is like trying to drop a pebble in an olympic sized swimming pool of water and causing it to create a wave over one leaf. there are so many variables at work that it is impossible to achieve what you are saying.

            The difference is that you're using evidence to arrive at a conclusion, rather than having a conclusion and trying to find the reasoning behind it.
           </p>
           <p>
            There isn't anything wrong with that, of course, but it requires a different mode of thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saying that "I don't understand why the US is allied with Israel" isn't really relevant, because it's concrete and verifiable fact that the US is allied with Israel. It is not, however, concrete fact that the global elite are using HAARP-like instruments to kill off large portions of the population, so you'd need to build a rather strong case for it in order to be taken seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm also not sure if I really believe that the global elite think homogeneously. That link you just posted makes a lot of powerful claims, but doesn't really prove any of them - for example, if "biotech companies" are trying to develop corn that makes people sterile
            <em>
             secretly
            </em>
            , how does Leuren Moret know about it? How does Mexican corn being genetically modified (not that that's a good thing, just bear with me) prove that it's
            <em>
             sterilizing
            </em>
            ? Also, why would the University of California Berkeley, one of the most liberal establishments in the country, be in kahoots with the global biotech industry? It quotes Henry Kissinger a lot, but Kissinger hasn't really had any political power since 'Nam. The article then goes on and on about what they call "Bio-Weapons Level 4 facility" - this is just blatant fearmongering, as such facilities already exist (the biggest one is USAMRIID, probably most well known for its involvement in the Ebola Reston scandal). Also, what the fuck is an "ethnic-specific bio-weapon"? That violates common logic. The article claims that an "excellent example" of population control policies is the use of depleted uranium in the middle east - you know, ignoring the fact that depleted uranium is about as harmful as lead, and has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have real benefits in the penetration capabilities of a bullet. In fact, it's actually
            <em>
             safer
            </em>
            then a pure lead bullet, because if enough of those end up in your river basin, suddenly everyone who lives in that town gets brain cancer a decade later (this actually happened a lot pre-WWII, because they hadn't yet figured out that drinking lead causes problems). Finally, their sources are pretty shitty; one of them was written by the same author (why the fuck would you source yourself), and the two other ones are dead links.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, yes, it's important to find a motive when determining something like this. People don't do things for no reason. There is no benefit to be gained by killing large amounts of working people, and there's a LOT of reasons why you'd want the opposite to happen.

            If we are treating this as a Class 3 and not a Class 2, then it's time we started asking the 'unanswerable' questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why? The killer question that is generally safe to ignore, but crucial when trying to induce something. Why would the elites of the world want a lower population? It's very,
            <em>
             very
            </em>
            fortunate for them that most people in the world are poor. More people means more taxes (for example, the USA already makes routine calculations to see what income tax revenue will be in 5-10 years), more people to do the grunt work that robots can't, etc. Depopulation just doesn't fit in with that goal. You could make the argument that China is already trying to do this (one-child-law), but that's because China doesn't actually have the ability to support even as many people as it already does. And I heard they were repealing that, anyway.

            That could be, though I personally suspect it is a bit more complicated than that. I think there are oligarchs who maintain control over the various paths that people can follow to become empowered, and that plays a large role in who gets in and who doesn't. I think that there's also coercion and threats in politics by its very nature, and those can cause even good people to do things that by all appearances are harmful mistakes. And then I think ignorance is a big thing too - a lot of people in government, especially legislators, are completely ignorant of the issues they are deciding upon, influenced by whatever information they are fed by lobbyists who, lobbyists who are funded by the rich and influential more often than not.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know. It may be that simply being in that position will corrupt a person intrinsically, but I think it is more likely there are a variety of influences and variables at play, which coalesce in bad results.

            So my initial reaction to this post was moderate-to-strong skepticism/disbelief. I've heard of HAARP, but have kind of dismissed the conspiracy theories about it as being more along the class-2 theories on
            <a href="https://archive.is/6tXD7">
             the conspiracy theory rating scale
            </a>
            . But I started viewing the links in your post. Now I'm not really sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel that this warrants further investigation, and I'd bump the conspiracy theory up to a class-3. The depopulation quotes are particularly disconcerting.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that it is important not to give in to panic and fear, as that can cloud judgment, and a scared people are much easier to manipulate than when they are calm, and too scared people sometimes panic and do harmful things when they are acting on incomplete or incorrect information. We should be careful, cautious, and sort the information out before jumping to the conclusion that most of us will be dead in 20 years due to HAARP and fukushima radiation (or other sources of radiation, like the TSA scanners).
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a very scary thought, I agree. I like what
            <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth">
             hans rosling has said about population
            </a>
            , about the overpopulation myth. His ted talk about it was pretty enlightening. the notion that as countries have increasing quality of life, families tend to have fewer children, generally one or two, and that based on historical trends it is likely population rates will stabilize in the not-too-distant future as a matter of course. It's comforting. I think, too, that improved agricultural processes, like
            <a href="http://liveweb.archive.org/http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/THE-MAN-WHO-WOULD-FEED-THE-WORLD-John-Jeavons-2851481.php">
             John Jeavons' Grow Biointensive farming
            </a>
            and
            <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world">
             Paul Stamets ideas about mycorhizal farming
            </a>
            would resolve our food supply issues without the need for potentially harmful GMO fearmongering ("we NEED GMOs to feed everyone!").
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that things like this are why its important we have a functioning government system, why its important to hold elected officials accountable and get sane folks in there who represent our interests. IF HAARP is being used to create earthquakes and disasters, I could see it being used as a strategic weapon to promote american interests without the need for it to be about global depopulation. I think we should be careful about assuming that it is being employed for that purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to see if we can find more information about HAARP. I don't know enough about it, whether officially or unofficially.

             I dont know jack shit about HAARP, but if it exists and is capable of causing earthquakes, i would not support its use.I simply see no stragetic value to be gained in its use. What purpose would we need something like that for?

              Well approaching this from the perspective of like the neoconservatives, the people who want an american empire, the idea of having such a powerful terrorist weapon would be appealing in order to induce fear and compliance. Same thing with having hydrogen bombs. They are terrible terrible things when used for military or political purposes, but there are people who would find them valuable from a strategic military perspective. Even if the ability to create earthquakes wherever you want is not actually possible, the
              <em>
               impression
              </em>
              that you may have such a weapon can be a very powerful thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ok, so apart from military use, if it does indeed have the capability to alter weather patterns or move hurricanes here or there, I could see that being useful for
              <em>
               deterring
              </em>
              harm from or managing natural weather disasters. Maybe inducing little earthquakes in some places could alleviate pressure that might otherwise mount into very large earthquakes. I don't know. To me it sounds like
              <em>
               if
              </em>
              it can do all of these things it is alleged to do in the OP, then it is a tool that could plausibly be used for good or ill.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think we need more information though than what is in this post before coming to any solid conclusions. It is an interesting avenue of thought to pursue and investigate though.

               Interesting. I really dont understand the technology behind it but if it could really deter natural distaster then it is cool that it has SOME potential use for good. I wonder what it would do long term to the environment it is used in

            Yeah it's tough. I think if there's valid criticism then it should be expressed with neutral emotional content, contain no personal attacks or pejoratives etc. and generally be made from a position of trying to promote critical thinking and truth rather than demeaning those you disagree with or feel are mistaken. Some people get off on being dicks, some people get off on creating huge emotional fights - and those kinds of fights harm the community because they discourage participation in the discussion for fear of being attacked.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know the perfect solution to the problem of trolls like this other than little rules of thumb like being vigilant in identifying belligerent behavior, being aware of the problems that can arise in interactions with them, and trying not to let it affect you emotionally.

              /v/thought
             </a>
             a few days ago.  Both parties need to open their
             <a href="https://www.noodle.com/articles/carl-sagans-rules-for-critical-thinking-and-nonsense-detection">
              minds
             </a>
             and keep researching and observing.  Looking at who's in this conversation, I hope there are no shills, we're just part of trying to grow voat without negativity taking over.  I do feel this post is better over in wildspeculation at this point, but who among us knows jack, really? :-)
            </p>
            <p>
             I do know that in the days spent 3/11/11 and onward in front of the nhk webcam watching those 3 reactors blow, and looking at who was immediately downwind, moi and moi's loved ones, my whole world changed and imo, if that didn't happen for you, you weren't paying attention to the fact that an extinction level event just happened.  It's not fixed over there and never will be in many lifetimes.  The amount of radiation being released is totally unprecedented in history with no end in sight.  Like future generations will have to come up with the technology to "clean up" Fuku.  In the meantime, it spews and leaks continually.  It's some dangerous stuff and yet we continue to operate and build more nuclear plants even in the US.  Complete folly.

              Jack is a good friend of mine, thank you very much.  I like Jill too but don't get me started on this "family dynamic".  Yuck.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding extinction level events, that would be the rise in global CO2 levels driven by the fantasy of unlimited growth on a finite planet.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are safer reactor designs and the Gates Foundation is funding the fourth generation Breeder type reactors that we will certainly need to supplement wind and solar as we jettison our carbon fuel sources.  I know that it is mothers milk on the progressive side to deny the role that nuclear will have to play in this transition but I will side with the scientist and former anti-nuclear folks who now see no alternative.  Honest people have made the case and I find it compelling.  The alternative of simply not having the power is unrealistic and not based in political reality.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you want to save this human civilization and prevent a worsening catastrophe which global warming/ocean acidification represents then you must re-look at the limited role that nuclear will have to play here.

            "in light of these revelations"
           </p>
           <p>
            The biggest revelation in these tinfoil-hat "exposés" is that there is a
            <em>
             tremendous
            </em>
            confidence in, at least, the
            <strong>
             power
            </strong>
            of government and science to control events.
           </p>
           <p>
            If only that were true. That would be a real message of hope.

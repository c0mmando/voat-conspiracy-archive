I have always assumed there was some powerful group that grew and died within empires and kingdoms, but they had a very limited reach of power, and sometimes the two groups never even crossed paths.</p>
<p>I have heard, literally every powerful group or family being accused of some pretty heinous stuff, and I would like to get some hard facts on who is running the show, or who the main players are. I am well aware 9/11 was an inside/international job (SA, Israel, who knows who else?). So I am pretty knowledgeable about what the U.S has been up to, and noticed if you replace &quot;U.S&quot; with USSR or DPRK you couldn\'t tell the crimes apart.</p>
<p>I have tried to use Occam\'s razor to determine who is part of &quot;TPTB&quot;, and who fights them and who their victims are. Either I am getting better at catching their BS, but 2016 they preformed unexpectedly poor. Mainly their propaganda outreach project (AKA Mainstream Media). They really do seem to be losing a lot of control, I think in 2016 they lost big because a high level player was successfully spear-phished using a freaking Gmail account and their sloppy codewords clearly revealed that child sex slaves (aka Pizzagate) are brought in to &quot;please&quot; our <s>President</s> temporary regime figurehead, which was something I heard before on some forums, but dismissed the notion, I now know there really is a network operating in multiple nations. I never thought that a network was required to do 9/11, because I based my knowledge of 9/11 on Operation Northwoods, so I figured it was just super high level spooks behind false flag attacks and such, but who would have thought John Podesta\'s emails would prove there is in fact a network of fairly low level actors doing stuff I figured only high level players got involved with?</p>
<p>As a Jew (as an atheist there is a big difference from an ultra-orthodox believer of Judaism, where which according to them, Jews literally are the master race, a more &quot;lite&quot; version of what the Nazi\'s belief system was) I of course have first hand knowledge that Jews are not out to install the NWO (this is based on never being invited or given any &quot;Jew Privilege&quot;, in fact I suffer from what many American\'s do from anxiety to deep depression, so seeing as how I enjoy posting on forums that question the official narrative and when I see an otherwise well researched post using (((Some Random Person))) it turns me off of what might have been a good read, because the fact they could be so fundamentally wrong about who is running the show (as a jew, I barely scrape by). But I am not a Rothchild, Bush, Clinton/random powerful family so I have no clue what they are up to. Then of course I see organizations take a lot of heat that at least as a somewhat rational person I can tell are clearly red herrings. </p>
<p>So, my TPTB looks like this:</p>
<p>Top level:
An unknown secret society founded during the time communication became instantaneous and wealth was becoming easier to hoard (so I think TPTB that we are fighting today was founded in the late 19th century or early 20th century), there goal is for them and their family to kill or replace most of the 7 billion humans after the technology has been invented, and maybe their group plans on making a utopia for themselves, and then simply kill off everyone else who have long out lived their usefulness. The only &quot;work&quot;, the remaining elites will do will be occasionally repairing the self-repairing robotic slaves.</p>
<p>High level
The &quot;Presidency&quot;, most world leaders (I say most and not all, because it was very clear Muammar Gaddafi was a sovereign leader who although was a bit eccentric, I think he was probably one of the more ethical world leaders, because his country had a HDI only slightly lower then the U.S and he achieved this in Africa and AFAIK didn\'t kill close to as many people as the U.S has. Bashar al-Assad also looks like he is an ethical sovereign leader, sure he wasn\'t elected, but I would prefer a centrist dictator over an elected war-monger (Bush, Clinton, ETC). Besides the current proxy war in Syria, I could find no evidence Bashar al-Assad was ever involved in any domestic or foreign war (although his father was a different story). So who knows how many nations are truly &quot;sovereign&quot; and not a satellite state for TPTB, in fact when it comes to U.S sovereignty I bet we are the home base for TPTB, because we now preform what the British empire once did, we just give it a nicer paint job.</p>
<p>Mid level:
Directors of secret agencies, like the CIA, FBI, FSB, former Schutzstaffel and of course the former KGB. How well do these guy really play together? Or how much of it is an act? There are also occaslionaly heroes that blow the whistle at this level.</p>
<p>Low level/this is were WE THE PEOPLE still are sometimes able to choose:
This level includes some U.S State Governors, Senators, and a larger sized handful State Reps.</p>
<p>Your level:
This would include mayor, your city counsel, and state Representatives. In fact the Free State Project has succeeded in electing over a dozen state Representatives in NH, which proves with only a small amount of people doing HARD work, we can still stop TPTB.</p>
<p>Alternative happy ending:</p>
<p>Or maybe we humans luck out and a benevolent <strong>intelligence explosion (IE)</strong> occurs before TPTB succeed.</p>
<p>That is why I believe so strongly in Elon Musk\'s work, and especially his latest endeavor: <a href="https://openai.com/blog/">https://openai.com/blog/</a></p>
<p>And hopefully a friendly actor will be the first to create a benevolent IE from the research by the HBP: <a href="https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/">https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/</a></p>
<p>TL;DR
Who is TPTB?</p>
<p>My personal belief is that a benevolent <strong>intelligence explosion (IE)</strong> will occur before TPTB complete their evil deeds and the friendly AI seizes control and we all live happily ever after.</p>',

            My idea of the establishment is a bit more mundane than yours. Are there secret societies like the Illuminati, Freemasons, Skull and Bones? Yes, but I don't take such organizations to be the driving force behind everything (although some rich and influential people get into secretive 'clubs').
           </p>
           <p>
            So, who's at the top? I think banks might exert the most influence right now. Now when I say they exert the most influence, the key word is exert. That doesn't mean I think they're all powerful, just that our crooked politicians let them get away with too much right now. So, following the money my map of the main establishment pipeline goes like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            Banks &gt; Corporations &gt; Governments &gt; Schools &gt; Media
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm focusing on the US because that's the country I'm familiar with, and it's the one exercising the most influence int the world right now. The CFR facilitates cooperation among these groups. The schools/colleges form a special element in the pipeline, as they ready the players and pawns for the game. In earlier times I would have put the Church up there with the government, but I think they've pretty much lost their place in the establishment. This model is drastically simplified, and makes things seem more clear cut than they are in reality. I think it makes for a decent overview though.

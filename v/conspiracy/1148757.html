            Okay, but .04 percent of the population is not enough to conduct a 'eugenics' experiment.  Unless you're saying the numbers are rising because of publicity and campaigning.

            I doubt it will be slavery. Fat people are very unproductive, and a drain on resources. I also doubt that they would survive a prolonged recession.

            Seriously, morbid obesity is more fatal than smoking.
           </p>
           <p>
            One possibility is that the obesity epidemic is a hedge. Money goes into short term investment for feeding them and keeping them alive just long enough, then when enough of the population is obese or in culling stage,
            <strong>
             BAM
            </strong>
            something happens. Perhaps a shortage of diabetic supplies, or a health care system crash. Next thing we know the population is back down to 250 million or 200 million.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the real estate and job markets will return to 1980s levels.

            Then there's jenner, the poster child for the movement, who didnt even get the genital reassignment? That always bugged me. The media latched onto that story and slid a bunch of bigger stories around the same time. This might explain why the trans issue was selected to be brought up, instead of just staging/inciting some other event like they usually would as a distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking at this from a purely utilitarian/psychopathic perspective, 30k per surgery is probably pretty cheap when compared to the long term healthcare costs that would be racked up in a socialist system, which we are rapidly heading towards. Maybe they want to groom the populous in a shape that allows their system to work?

             I have wondered if the obesity epidemic is engineered, designed to shorten the age of the population so as to limit benefit payouts. Remember that social security was created back when the average life expectancy was in the 60s. The system was not designed for people to live to be 80, much less 100.
            </p>
            <p>
             so how does a future society cope with having to provide healthcare and social security to 300 million people? Maybe it can't. So they have to find an ethical way to cull the population, or at least a way that they can get away with.
            </p>
            <p>
             So we have these movements, the LGBT and the Healthy at every size movements. both advocate very self destructive life styles. One advocates become so unhealthy that you die at 50, right when you pay off your student loans, the other advocates getting a surgery that increases you chance for suicide drastically.
            </p>
            <p>
             Suddenly the system is not drained so heavily, and it is left wit a "better quality" of person, one that is more "deserving" of benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Or i could just be crazy. An utter nut job who sees patterns that don't exist.

            Mental illness is just a catchall term for "people we don't like dealing with."

            There's definitely an agenda afoot with this whole transitioning between poles of the binary bullshit. Historically, these people were just a little different and that was ok, and encouraged, because people were cool. People are not so cool anymore and being different creates revulsion in the modern domestic ape. You've got to "fit in."

             Indeed. A "perfect" society will consist of people that only the establishment likes. People that perform well on their standardized tests, like the things they are told to, and conform to the clean design of the "clean" future.
            </p>
            <p>
             The "mentally ill" do not fit into this scheme. Are they inferior, or is it that the system that they don't conform to is flawed? I tend to believe it is the latter, and archaeological and genetic evidence tends to agree.

            Before you're able to remove all the degenerates from society, you must first identify them.  How do you identify a gay person, or a transgender person, or any other degenerate.  Well you can't.  So you must have them identify themselves first.

            The mokst well known "anonymous" youtube channel posted that video about trying to attack Q, operation qanon or whatever.
            <br/>
            Then another who had left that group posted a video taht didn't mention but basically aligned with (1) Q and claims, (2) the old anonymous that we used ot know for taking down corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Parrots and shills will say "but everyone/nobody is anonymous. it's just an idea".  Bullfuckingshit.  There was an inner circle of decentralized but regular individuals.  Most were busted, co-opted, recruited, etc. by the alphabet agencies.  Some were not.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would believe that the "maiN" youtube channel was either coopted or was simply run by mostly leftwingers who wanted to push their political ideas with that video.

            I think your angle's wrong, but you might be onto something. I don't remember anonymous ever being considered a threat or taken seriously other than the "hackers on steroids", "domestic terrorists", "Internet hate machine" event. Maybe that was their original intention but it failed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heres my thought: Anonymous can be anyone and everyone. But who has the most resources for internet manipulation? The spooks, deep state etc. So it's feasible for a grassroots operation to be deliberately created, to make the start and then let it snowball with the "useful idiots".
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't remember / care enough to look up their exploits to figure out their goals. And it's not a real group because anyone and everyone is part of it, so it would be difficult to figure out what started what.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only significant actions the "group" has done is raise public awareness of Scientology. Maybe this was a distraction, or priming public opinion or something.

             Hey thanks! Just a random thought that popped into my head today.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have a suspicious attitude towards a company named NTT Nipond Telegraph Telecom something or other. I think they are a major supplier of cloud systems but I don't have a clue how that stuff works.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am only curious because they have a weird U.K. headquarters right across the street from Bank of England and Rothschild bank in the City of London.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just trying to always connect dots. Thanks for your insight.

              NTT is ranked 65th in the Fortune Global 500. I think anything that high up is bound to be compromised and serving higher purposes. That headquarters could be used for any number of things...

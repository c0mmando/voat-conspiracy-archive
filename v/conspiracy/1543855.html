Passing away more than 20 years ago, she made some startling predictions of the future before her death. These predictions range from the identity of the last United States President to the fall of Rome and even the eventual death of planet Earth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-what-baba-vanga-predicted-for-2016-and-the-192833607.html?ref=gs">https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-what-baba-vanga-predicted-for-2016-and-the-192833607.html?ref=gs</a> It\'s yahoo, I know. Unfortunately, this was the most clear and concise source I could find .</p>
<p>In this examination we will be specifically focusing on her predictions detailing the Muslim invasion and subsequent destruction of Europe. By no means is this my opinion nor is it an attack on the Islamic faith, I merely take prophecy and compare it to current events in order to better understand where we are headed. Additionally, I will not be focusing on western involvement in the Middle East as I cannot provide any empirical evidence to the fact.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Muslim War</strong></p>
<p>We begin in Syria with the start of a \'Great Muslim War\' as detailed by the Bulgarian. I really don\'t think I need to go into great detail on this one but for the sake of information, I will.</p>
<p>In 2013, we saw the rise of a de-facto group named the Islamic State In Syria (ISIS). The average person, undoubtedly, would equate this group to nothing more than a highly advanced terror cell but they would be wrong. Much like the ancient Assyrians, terror is merely a means to a specific end. These beasts of no nation have only one goal in mind: the establishment of a new Islamic Caliphate which would mirror the Ottoman Empire. For three years this group ran wild through Iraq and Syria forcing millions from their homelands and directly causing one of the largest migrations in modern history. Eventually, major world powers got involved and ISIS began to lose it\'s grip but, instead of accepting defeat, they simply began to disperse into other regions of the world. Their focus has now shifted to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>The Muslim Invasion of Europe</strong></p>
<p>If you have been paying attention to MSM narrative for the past decade you have probably heard, at least once, that Right Wing= Terrorism. Their is a certain truth to this statement as Radical Islam primarily revolves around Right-Minded thinking and governmental policies such as Sharia Law. With the Migration problem in full swing (routes detailed by this map:http://i.imgur.com/fo611LO.png) it just so happens that there is also a significant decline for Leftist governments taking place at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/24/europes-traditional-left-is-in-a-death-spiral-even-if-you-dont-like-the-left-this-is-a-problem/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/24/europes-traditional-left-is-in-a-death-spiral-even-if-you-dont-like-the-left-this-is-a-problem/</a></p>
<p>With these two factors combined it will allow for the establishment of Islamic rule to take root. In fact, this has already begun. You may have heard that London recently elected its first Muslim mayor or even that Sharia Law is now being enforced in major Western-European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and even The Netherlands. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/w6sSq6J.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/w6sSq6J.jpg</a> Eventually, this spread will reach a critical mass. What I mean by this is that once the major players of western Europe succumb to this, the other minor countries will simply fall in line. It\'s Passive Invasion 101 and essentially the same tactic used by European countries in the New World when they sent missionaries and the like.</p>
<p><strong>The Fall of Rome, The Rise of the Caliphate</strong></p>
<p>Baba Vanga also predicted that Rome would become the capital of the new caliphate. In order for this to happen, however, the current Rome would first have to fall in order to make room. Enter: St. Malachy and the Prophecy of the Popes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Popes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have not read the book Petrus Romanus by Chris Putnam and Thomas Horn, it is worth a read. They go in-depth with this prophecy and explain it very vividly.</p>
<p>St. Malachy wrote a list of 112 cryptic phrases in Latin that purportedly details and describes the identity of all the Popes leading up to the end and destruction of the Roman Church, the current rule of Rome. As detailed in Putnam and Horn\'s book, the final Pope, Petrus Romanus, is none other than Pope Francis. Francis also happens to be the FIRST Jesuit Pope. If you are not familiar with the Jesuit agenda, you should do some digging.</p>
<p>The correlation and timing of these two prophecies is arguably undeniable in contrast to current events and sets the stage for what would seem to be a large catastrophic shift in the near-future of Europe. Although pale in comparison of what\'s to come, it would mimic the purges of WW2. The ripples of such an event will be felt through out the entire world.</p>
<p><strong>Informed Speculation</strong></p>
<p>Using what we have learned from ISIS in the Middle East and the resulting mass-migration, I believe it is safe to assume that a like-wise migration will occur in the future. This time, however, it will be Europeans seeking refuge from the Islamic onslaught.</p>
<p><em>\'They\' knew!</em> </p>
<p>By \'they\' I mean the elite. In America, this is why we started hearing about the FEMA camps and the purchasing of stockpiles of ammunition so many years ago but, as of yet, haven\'t seen their use. When the Europeans flee, where do you think they will go? The same place Europeans have fled to for almost the last 400 years; North America. They knew this was going to happen and prepared accordingly.</p>
<p>If you live in Europe or have family that does, I suggest you start making preparations for this sooner rather than later. The mainland of Europe, almost overnight, will be transformed resulting in safety and security going out the window.</p>
<p>If you live in the UK, however, you will be a little more secure. As an island nation, the UK is easier to defend because they can just shut down air-sea travel from the mainland. Historically, they have used these tactics to much success. This might explain all the fuss over Brexit and a reason they are pulling out of the EU, because they know it will soon fall.</p>

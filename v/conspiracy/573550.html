            I live in bigfoot country... deeps in the woods of North Idaho and Montana....   Used be lots of talk of bigfoot; reported sightings and such.  Hell one of the old cabins down the road from me, was featured in a 70's bigfoot movie/doc where the owner would BBQ steaks and play his banjo for a family of bigfoots ever few days...    This was all like 20-25 years ago.   Then something happened.   The reports died off and now-a-days you never hear of a bigfoot sighting among the locals.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think two things happened
1) The invention of the quad.   You hear these things ripping around the woods all day, almost every day now.  People are just everywhere on these things, really ripping up the environment.  They "4-wheel" recklessly and they really do a fair amount of damage.   Plus you can hear them miles away.
           </p>
           <p>
            2)  This made the forest MUCH smaller.  In fact  most people would not understand how small the forest is getting.    People, roads, homes, garbage, gun shots, cabins, campsites are everywhere now.
           </p>
           <p>
            The habitat for a large creature like this is very rapidly eroding in the U.S. (the last U.S. evergreen forests only make up a small portion of north Idaho, about 1/3 of Montana and a bit in Washington and a tad in North Oregon.  In fact, many bigfoot positive people have assumed that the remainder have migrated north into canada.   But who really knows.??!
           </p>
           <p>
            Now UFO's...A whole different matter...  Can't go a week around here without somebody seeing "something" in the sky at night.

            I wouldn't be surprised if bigfoot did exist. An intelligent primate in north america could elude people fairly easily, especially if their population was very small. The strange hairs from the video the article links to are quite compelling, as are the footprint castings which are consistent, despite being decades apart.
           </p>
           <p>
            The one question I have is if bigfoot does exist, why don't we find their bodies or skeletons anywhere? Do they bury their dead or otherwise dispose of the bodies in some way? If they just keeled over and died like most animals, then we would eventually find a bone or something that confirms their existence.

             remember Elephants "bury" their dead.  so it's not out of place to thing a squatch could do the same.  I suspect a semi-intelligent creature could easily bury their dead.   They may even have some sort of "eat the dead' ritual of a primitive culture.   Hard to say....

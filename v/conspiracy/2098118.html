<p>Yesterday, there was info showing that the alley of the accident was blocked several minutes before there were a passing crowd of counter-protestors there. A fat girl stopped her car car there, and parked it there in the middle of the street until the crash. And when the crash happened, there was another car between this fatso, and her purple van.</p>
<p>The context of the situation was: The alt-right came to watch their speech. A huge crowd of antifa stood between them and the place the were suppose to go to watch the unite the right rally. So when alt-right tried to get there, antifa did what they did. We then saw the same happening there that earlier happened on the likes of berkeley: Cops stood completely paralyzed. They didn\'t even stopped fights that were less than 1meter of distance from themselves.</p>
<p>So fights broke down, and it was declared an unlawful manifestation, and the cops started expelling the alt-right from the place, after watching 30 to 40 minutes of streets brawls.</p>
<p>When the alt-right were going away from the site, antifa started following them around. They entered the street where the fat girl parked here car in the middle of the street, and that was when it happened the crash.
The crashed helicopter was RIGHT UPSIDE THEM, to the point of being possible to see it\'s reflex on the purple car window reflex.</p>
<p>My theory is: A girl died. Democrats planned this to justify their absolute crackdown on the alt-right digitally, on the media and also an excuse to ramp up violence on the streets too. It\'s a shutdown thing. The google owning 4chan hypothesis is a real possibility too.</p>
<p>Thats my thoughts. It\'s a SHUT IT DOWN operation, headed by the democrats or someone inside it to crush the alt-right.</p>
<p>Also, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO THE STATE POLICE HELICOPTER THAT MADE IT CRASH AND KILLED TWO TROOPERS?????? NOBODY IS LOOKING AT IT.</p>

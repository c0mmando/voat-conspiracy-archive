<p><strong>1 Saint</strong> - originally it was &quot;sane&quot;, as in &quot;sane mind in sane body&quot;. Sane people are normal, while insane people are abnormal. Now christians believe that a saint is some kind of supernatural being, instead of just normal - sane.</p>
<p><strong>2 Sinner</strong> - originally &quot;insane&quot;, as in &quot;insane mind in insane body&quot;. Insane people are abnormal and willing to commit negative acts, like cheaters, thieves, murders, perverts, etc. Now christians believe that being a sinner is a choice.</p>
<p><strong>3 Satanism</strong> - originally madness. Satan and demon represent craziness in humans. It is a mental disease, or inborn degeneration that was known in ancient Greece and Rome. Now christians believe that it is something supernatural.</p>
<p><strong>4 Heaven</strong> - originally heaven is a mental and physical condition. When the majority of society are mentally sane, they can create a safe haven to live long and prosper. Now christians believe that they will go to heaven after death.</p>
<p><strong>5 Hell</strong> - originally hell is a mental and physical condition. When the majority of society are mentally insane, they create hell, where life is based on suffering because nothing works around. Now christians believe that they will go to hell after death.</p>
<p><strong>6 Soul</strong> - originally means &quot;anima&quot;, &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot;, what is produced by the brain. In ancient Greece and Rome it was well known what is a brain, and that your soul is inside your brain. Now christians believe that a soul is something supernatural.</p>

            What the hell?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bible is in (koine) Greek and Greek translations of Hebrew and Aramaic. I'm not certain what you mean by "Judeo-Christianism", but when "Roman Christianity" institutionalized itself in Europe, they spoke and wrote in Latin.

              <strong>
               Saint
              </strong>
              is an English derivative of
              <em>
               sanctus
              </em>
              , a past participle of the longstanding verb
              <em>
               sancio
              </em>
              , meaning "to make sacred, render inviolable, fix unalterably, establish, appoint, decree, ordain, confirm, ratify, enact". It relates to a general Indo-European root involving "honor", as with the Sanskrit sac, which means to accompany as an honor guard. The notion of sanity as in "sana mens in corpore sano" (a phrase from Juvenal) is
              <em>
               sana
              </em>
              , meaning "healthy". There are not really "saints" in the bible.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "Sin" is a particularly English word, going back to Old English. It derives from a German root meaning "to be true", with the idea that the true thing was akin to guilty verdict.
              <a href="https://bible.org/article/thirty-three-words-sin-new-testament-part-1">
               There are a MESS of words for sin in the Greek bible
              </a>
              .
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Satan is not a name, but a position. In Hebrew, the word is שָׂטָן‏, which is a legal term, like accuser or "the prosecution". The word entered Greek with no change, but it was taken as a name.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              As for "heaven", this word is from Old English
              <em>
               heofen
              </em>
              , meaning "sky". This word is difficult to connect with other languages, but usually it just meant "sky". In the Greek bible, with was οὐρανός. The etymology is difficult, but the word seems to mean anything like a vaulted roof or tent peak. It's an old idea, from Homer and Hesiod. What is it in Hebrew? Shamayim (שָׁמַיִם), literally a shin-causative of mayim (מַיִם), waters. Heaven is literally "the place which makes the waters". Think of rain.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              As for "hell", it comes from a root for "cover". It means "the covered over place" and refers to where the dead are after burial. The same idea lies behind the Hebrew
              <em>
               sheol
              </em>
              שְׁאוֹל, which means "grave". What did Greeks say? ᾍδης, which was a personal name for the god of the dead. It extended to the domain of the dead.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Old English had
              <em>
               sawol
              </em>
              for soul. It meant "soul, life, spirit, being" with the same idea as the German Seele. The
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_in_the_Bible">
               Greek and Hebrew
              </a>

            Rather than your obviously not main words, how about the actual words that the jews have PURPOSELY CONFUSED over time? Words such as
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <strong>
              JEW
             </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              JUDEO-CHRISTIANITY
             </strong>
             A word which does not even exist.
            </li>
            <li>
             <strong>
              ZIONIST
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Explanations to follow.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <strong>
              JEW
             </strong>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The main problem stems from the fact that the word Jew/Judaism has multiple meanings, but most people don’t realize this. This confusion was brought about intentionally. The word Jew was invented a couple centuries ago in English translations of the Bible as a shortened form of the word Judean. This refers to the province of Judea, which at the time of the New Testament was a multi-racial, multicultural area, whose capital city was Jerusalem, which was controlled by the Pharisees. Jesus and most of His disciples did not come from Judea–they came from Galilee–and therefore were not Jews by the Biblical definition. Judea was originally inhabited by the Israeli tribe of Judah, but by this point was quite mixed. Whereas Galilee was inhabited only by the Israeli tribe of Benjamin. The only disciple that was a Jew was Judas, who betrayed Jesus.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Pharisees were the evil Talmudists who Jesus opposed, and who ultimately got Jesus killed for daring to disagree with them. Later, Jerusalem was destroyed, and some Pharisees survived and became rootless nomads. Along the way they mixed with more people who converted to Talmudism. Then, after the invention of the English word Jew, the Talmudists started calling themselves Jews, and renamed their religion Judaism. They started claiming that they’re the people who lived in ancient Israel, and that they’re the “chosen people” spoken of in the Bible. In reality, their religion completely contradicts the Old Testament–even the Torah–and they know it, but they’ll never admit it. They brought about such a deliberate conflation and confusion of the word Jew that today people now use a definition of Jew that is expanded to include everyone in ancient Israel when that’s not at all what Jew meant originally. They also like to conflate Judaism with Hebrewism, but the religion of the Pharisees (Talmudism) only began after they returned from captivity in Babylon, and the Old Testament religion of the Hebrew people before that was quite different. Today, only a tiny minority of people who call themselves “Jews” don’t follow the Talmud.
            </p>
            <p>
             The modern confusion comes from the fact that most people–even most Christians–don’t realize this linguistic and historical deception. This is especially true of the English-speaking world (Protestants, foremost), due to modern, bastardized, heretical translations of the Bible, plus a divorce from the true traditions of the original Christian church. They’ve totally forgotten how the Jews persecuted Christians endlessly before Christians eventually gained power through the Roman Empire and started dishing it right back to them. Just like a nation becomes ruined when it forgets its own history, the same is true of a religion. In fact, the same arguments used to claim that Christianity is inherently weak because it has now been subverted can be used to say that Western nations are inherently weak because they have been subverted, or that white people are inherently weak because a genocide is being committed upon them thanks to their altruism. It’s just not a good argument at all.

Most evangelicals are cults of personality with Bible flavoring and preach utter heresy–dual covenant theology and Zionism, for starters. The following are the best arguments for debating and trumping zionist evangelicals:

             <p>
              <em>
               Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
              </em>
              <strong>
               – Revelation 3:9
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              This points out how the Jews, as they call themselves, are not Godly, and that their subversion was predicted.
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
              </em>
              <strong>
               – Galatians 3:29
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              This destroys any notion of a Jewish right to the land of Israel based on the Bible, as the chosen people are those that accept Christ as savior–not a particular race and certainly not those that rejected Him.
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.
              </em>
              <strong>
               – 1 John 2:23
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              This destroys the idea that the Jews are still the chosen people, because they have denied Christ and so have denied God.
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

              Taken together, I have taught these passages to several tea party and conservative groups to massively undermine their support of Israel. You will be attacked at first, but if you learn the passages well enough, you can stump them and change the whole group.

              JUDEO-CHRISTIANITY
             </strong>
             A word which does not even exist.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Newsweek cites authorities who indicate that “the idea of a common Judeo-Christian tradition first surfaced at the end of the 19th century, but did not gain popular support until the 1940s, as part of an American reaction to Nazism…” and concludes that, “Since then, both Jewish and Christian scholars have come to recognize that–geopolitics apart–Judaism and Christianity are different–even rival–religions.” Joshua Jehouda, a prominent French Jewish leader, observed in the late 1950s: “The current expression ‘Judeo-Christian’ is an error which has altered the ccourse of universal history by the confusion it has sown in men’s minds, if by it one is meant to understand the Jewish origin of Christianity… If the term ‘Judeo-Christian’ does point to a common origin, there is no doubt that it is a most dangerous idea. It is based on a ‘contradictio in abjecto’ which has set the path of history on the wrong track. It links in one breath two ideas which are completely irreconcilable, it seeks to demonstrate that there is no difference between day and night or hot and cold or black and white, and thus introduces a fatal element of confusion to a basis on which some, nevertheless, are endeavoring to construct a civilization.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The few New Testament ‘proof texts’ utilized by Christian Zionists and secular proponents of the modern Judeo-Christian myth are the product of poor translation. Messianic Jewish writer Malcolm Lowe in his paper Who Are the Ioudaioi? concludes, like Robert and Mary Coote, that  the Greek word “Ioudaioi” in the New Testament  should be translated as “Judeans” rather than the more usual “Jews.” Israeli scholar David Stern also came to the same conclusion when translating the Jewish New Testament. Few Christians are aware that the translators of Scripture often mistranslated the word “Jew” from such words as “Ioudaioi” (meaning from, or being of as a geographic area, Judean). The word Judean, mistranslated as “Jew” in the New Testament, never possessed a valid religious connotation, but was simply used to identify members of the native population of the geographic area known as Judea.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also it is important to understand that in the Scriptures, the terms “Israel”, “Judah” and “Jew” are not synonymous, nor is the House of Israel synonymous with the House of Judah. The course of history is widely divergent for the peoples properly classified under each of these titles. Accordingly, the authoritative 1980 Jewish Almanac says, “Strictly speaking it is incorrect to call an ancient Israelite a Jew or to call a contemporary Jew an Israelite or a Hebrew.”
             </p>
             <p>
              A writer for The Dearborn Independent, published in Michigan in 1922, summarized the problem thus: “The pulpit has also the mission of liberating the Church from the error that Judah and Israel are synonymous.  The reading of the Scriptures which confuse the tribe of Judah with Israel, and which interpret every mention of Israel as signifying the Jews, is at the root of more than one-half the confusion and division traceable in Christian doctrinal statements.”
             </p>
             <p>
              While the Pharisees recognized the laws of Moses, they also claimed that there was a great body of oral tradition which was of at least equal authority with the written Law, and many claimed that the Tradition was of greater authority. By their tradition, they undertook to explain and elaborate upon the Law. This was the “Tradition of the Elders”, to which the name of Talmud was later given. It had its beginning in Babylon, during the Babylon captivity of the people of Judah, where it developed in the form of the commentaries of various rabbis, undertaking to explain and apply the Law. This was the foundation of Rabbinic Judaism. This Judaism was very different from the religion of the ancient Israelites. The late Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, who was the Chief Rabbi of the United States, expressed this conclusively when he said: “The return from Babylon, and the adoption of the Babylonian Talmud, marks the end of Hebrewism, and the beginning of Judaism.” The Jewish Encyclopedia tells us that the Talmud is actually “the product of the Palestinian and Babylonian schools” and is generally referred to as “the Babylonian Talmud.” Dr. Boaz Cohen in Everyman’s Talmud states the Talmud is the work of “numerous Jewish scholars over a period of some 700 years, roughly speaking, between 200 [BC] and 500 [AD].” Rabbi Louis Finkelstein in Volume 1 of The Pharisees, the Sociological Background of their Faith says, “Pharisaism became Talmudism, Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism, and Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism. But throughout these changes of name, inevitable adaption of custom, and adjustment of Law, the spirit of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Talmud, more than any other literature, so defined Judaism that Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser admitted, “Judaism is not the religion of the Bible.” (Judaism and the Christian Predicament, 1966, p.159) It is the Talmud that guides the life and spirit of the Jewish people. This is to say, therefore, that the central message of the Old Testament has been fulfilled in the New Testament. It must be understood that it was the position of Christendom for at least 1900 years. It was the position, not only of Justin Martyr, but of such Stalwart saints as Irenaeus and Hippolytus; a position embraced by Martin Luther and John Calvin, the two towering figures of the Protestant Reformation. Christianity and Judaism are two distinct religious inheritances. The very term “Judeo-Christian” is a mischievous misnomer without historical or Scriptural validity. “Judeo-Christianity” should be seen for what it is–another secular twentieth century,  manufactured for narrow political ends, that is supremely disrespectful to all true believers. Any fundamental unity that does exist between world religions cannot be appreciated by ignorant and secular scholarship, but only through knowledge of the great primordial and universal truths.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most Christians have been subverted by “Judeo-Christianity.” It’s not their fault. They were raised to be “Christian” and a combination of federal sabotage and Jewish lobby groups has ensured that this is what “Christianity” is for them. Believe it or not, the current institution doesn’t like Christians or Christian values at all. They haven’t for decades. Christians are too dangerous to keep around without being pacified in some manner. The real ones can’t be bribed, are almost impossible to threaten, and will do the right thing just because it’s the right thing to do or tell the truth even if it’s damaging because they feel it’s true and thus needs to be known.
             </p>
             <p>
              The leviathan the state has become has no love for Christian values or mores. It represents a direct threat to them and their power. Jews and Muslims both have passages about lying to others to protect yourself or deceiving others as to what your true faith really is so as to better attack your enemies. Christianity alone cleaves to the truth for no reason beyond that it is true. You will never see any Jewish or Muslim martyrs. The Christian predilection to make martyrs out of common men is what makes it a dangerous religion to globalism, corporate interests, and other sundry institutions. This is why Marching to Zion is so important. It’s a redpill that will turn any but the most terminally cuckservative Christian to our side. Enormous effort was put into suppressing the evangelical sector of America, the UK, and Europe for precisely this reason. If there is anything that world Jewry and NWO fear, it’s Christianity waking up.
             </p>
             <p>
              They believe they can suppress America, that they can control the UK, that Europe can do nothing to stop them, and that Putin will fall in line when pushed. They have the Chinese businessmen eating out of their hands, so desperate are they to have a seat at the world table. And Islam is nothing more than a false flag–a deliberately awoken animal made to run amok to frighten and confuse while the real criminals get away with their crimes. When the time comes, if everything goes according to their plans, they will be suppressed and incorporated into the whole, and Islam will be pacified or outright eradicated.
             </p>
             <p>
              If there is any nation where they fear something could go wrong, it’s America, where freedom of speech is protected–so you cannot simply legislate lies into being truth. If you are an American Christian, you are on the very cutting edge of the globalist suppression techniques. The greatest amount of brainwashing is being leveled at you. If anything goes wrong with their plans–if anything can completely derail their propaganda and turn the tide–it’s probably going to be Christians uncucking themselves. And if it starts anywhere, it’s going to be in America. People have grown sick and tired of establishment “conservatism.” They crave the real thing. They would not cleave so strongly to Trump if they were not prepared to shift towards it. This is your opportunity to actually push this information. You will never have another, better chance to redpill people than right now. Start with the Christians. They’re the most powerful ally in this fight.

            What's wrong with knowing people have free choice? They can choose to do good or bad. This puts the responsibility on the individual, not on some nebulous external "demon" making them do something.

            I've been suspicious of a setup since the beginning. Its also clear that Paddock wasn't any ordinary patsy. Maybe Paddock was part of the team sent to carry out the attack. Then they killed him for unrelated reasons and left him dead with the frame-job.

            Wasn't Room 235, the room which Trump (or was it Q) said that the Congress members left their phones in when they were reading 'the memo'?

            To whoever down votes, take the time to explain why instead of doing it out of habit when you see something that does not fit your view of reality. I know most people are not ready to get out of the matrix but i do my part to let the people that have eyes to see, see.

             No downvote, but the theory just seems too far fetched. Keep in mind, that anything can look credible if you throw enough words/videos at it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I lean towards a more simple approach. Look at liquids in zero/micro-gravity - it naturally forms a sphere. That, to me, is just about all the evidence I need, that planets, would naturally be spheres as well.

              The education system did not educate you but trained you to believe the globe and at the same time mock the ones you believe the flat earth. When you start looking into verifying their claims, their whole concept collapses. No globe, no evolution and no gravity. The agenda is to remove God from our lives so we rely on our sense of morals, but God's morals are perfect. They are preparing us to believe the upcoming fake UFO invasion, on the flat earth it is impossible. Funny how the us government always act like they are hiding something on the UFO's but keep saying there is nothing being hidden? It's because there is nothing to hide! There is nothing! No proof, they are just making us believe there is something.

              Von Braun's gravestone mentions Psalms 19:1: "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament (vault or dome) sheweth his handywork.(KJV)
             </p>
             <p>
              It also explains the nuclear high altitude tests, they were trying to blow up the dome, they failed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also how come Antarctica is restricted? to protect pinguins while we rape the rest of the earth? It is the edges of our world and they don't want us there.
             </p>
             <p>
              All these facts should make you question if liquids in zero gravity is enough to keep you believing in their lie.

               While you could certainly reverse my statement, about credibility, to say the same for our education system, I simply don't buy it. You talk about facts - but you have to admit, that there are more, rational fact, confirming the 'official' theory.
              </p>
              <p>
               You are implying, that every system on the planet has been tampered with. Everything. So when a radar operator sees a plane 'looping' around the planet, that has been tampered with? Was the programmer who wrote the software, instructed to make it 'seem' as if the planet was spherical?
              </p>
              <p>
               Antarctic is not restricted. There is just nothing for us to do there. We can't develop a frozen wasteland into anything, yet. I actually have a friend who is a crew member of a cargoship that goes there, often.
              </p>
              <p>
               The atmospheric nuclear tests was probably just that, a test - and they figured out, that it was a really, really bad idea to detonate that stuff in the upper atmosphere/stratosphere, and never did it again.
              </p>
              <p>
               I get that the theory is exciting - most conspiracies are. But seek your own truth - don't let anyone dictate it to you. That includes preachers of the Flat Earth Theory.

                They tell us there is nothing but penguins and snow, you can believe them if you want or you can go verify for yourself. But you cannot, it is controlled by the military. You can search for operation High Jump documentary, Admiral Byrd says there is "mountains of coal and evidence of oil/uranium".

                This treaty from the UN prevents unauthorized individuals from going there.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and having 53 parties as of 2016,[2] sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans military activity on that continent. The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat headquarters have been located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, since September 2004.[3]

                 That's not what I mean. Track a plane from Sydney to LA -&gt; from LA to NY -&gt; from NY to Amsterdam -&gt; from Amsterdam to Hong Kong -&gt; Hong Kong to Sydney (sure, not the exact same plane, but  the route is still a loop). How would that be possible in the proposed theory?

                 The treaty is there for a reason. Look at how much of the globe has been torn to pieces, because of military and corporate interests. Does it make it a perfect place to 'hide' something - sure - but you won't fall off any edges.

                  Do you know who is in charge of the plane trackers world wide? Nasa. if you look in the south hemisphere, in between America and Africa. as flights go across, they disappear and reappear.

                   I've seen plenty of stuff like that - and most of it, is just pure speculation, or fitting small discrepancies into an already fixed narrative.

                   A plane disappearing from radar, for a few seconds, is probably not that uncommon (as they switch to different tracking nodes when they traverse the planet). I also doubt that NASA is in control of all tracking nodes - you could, most likely, set one up yourself.

            Some studies show masturbation to increase testosterone.  But I'm sure the study didn't involve living off of cheetos and mountain dew in your mother's house, so I don't think they
            <em>
             really
            </em>
            investigated it properly.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will say that, in my hometown, there are a lot of drunk floozies.  I've been courted by 3 drunk floozies in the last 5 years and they ALWAYS pretend like they have their shit together.  They say things like "I started my own wedding planning business" and "I've been to Europe, I love the culture" to sound like they are elevated life-partner material.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole thing is a rouse - they are willing to trade sex for security while you buy dinner and groceries and help fix all their stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will slowly lose track of controlling their bad behavior as time goes on - they will reveal who they really are and you'll one day be wondering "how the fuck did I get here with this unbelievably miserable woman?".
           </p>
           <p>
            Masturbation can save you from that.  Masturbation can remove the chemical veil which tells you that you are interested in a certain woman and tells you that you can trust what she says because she is beautiful and you've always been ready to receive a beautiful, motivated woman into your life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masturbation can save you from all this in as little as 2-5 minutes, and it comes financially packaged with the internet you already paid for.  No taking the internet out to dinner.  Shit, you don't even need to view the highly charged images, you can just close your eyes and not feed the dirty porn world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, you can be a no-fap and there's nothing wrong with that - I'm not looking down on anyone (except "poly-amorous" libtards).
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes you got to realize you're pent up and acknowledge that release/relief is sometimes a good thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is definitely not the same things as living off cheetos and mountain dew in your mom's house beating off 5 times a day to hardcore inter-racial incest gangbang midget porn.

             Masturbation is normal and healthy. If a guy doesn't beat it, he'll get off in his sleep. We've all had a few of those. Men simply have way too much horniness not to get off when they're younger. I'm sure there have been a few guys who haven't done it, but it's not easy. Porn, on the other hand, is unnecessary and possibly harmful. I still look at it, but I am becoming increasingly conflicted. It's hard not to, because I'm horny.

                I know, but at least feel glad that we are "in" this age presently.  If you can accept this, then you can rejoice in the fact that we are heading towards moving out of that age as well (everything dies, right?).

               <p>
                Now, more than ever, MANY normal people I know have suspicions about the news - they are slowly waking up to how it works.  That's a pretty good start, no?  People are starting to look sideways at official mouthpieces and official channels of communication.  Sure there's still an army of brainwashed instagram/FB millenials out there, but it's really the last chance, desperate grasp of the legacy media to try and capture the minds of young, dumb, impressionable people as they try to pivot towards digital media.
               </p>
               <p>
                Legacy media's major problem is that "un-afflicted" people (60%-75% of the population?) don't identify with any of these garbage movements.  So they are pumping money into twatter, eddit, fakebook, and instaham to build established "cultures" - there's only one problem, we know it's all fake.  No, the girl with the huge craters in her oversized ass in the stretched out swimsuit isn't "a beaming galaxy of beauty".  They are scratching their own backs, jerking eachother off - and we see it from outside the fishbowl.  They can convince each other of things they ALREADY BELIEVE, but they can't convince anyone outside of their communities of anything.  Whereas on voat, we convince and attract new people every day - using facts and sometimes misinformation from reported stories/arrest records!  Not feel-good circle jerk pictures where we co-sign eachother's bullshit.  Sure there's some of that going on here, but there's much tongue in cheek and generally more

                </strong>
                .
               </p>
               <p>
                Even more exciting, as more people learn what forum-tilt/sliding is - and how paid-for posters who have 50+ usernames astroturf certain topics, people will over time see the turd in these punchbowl communities and either entrench themselves or leave.
               </p>
               <p>
                You are absolutely correct about the age of identity.  But look to the future!  Your future!  Our future!  When we come out of the box, there's no putting us back in.

             Thanks for the response. I totally agree. Porn can save a man from being impulsive, from immediately thinking with his little head.

              I believe the only reason Europe is because of "the elite" - there was no great population gap or shortage.  Even if there were signs of a population shortage, you can start incentivizing people to have babies through law (giving tax breaks or other financial advantages).  It's not up to the ruling class to just decide "hey we're going to let double digit IQ individuals with no concept of law and order in to bridge a perceived population gap".
             </p>
             <p>
              Masturbation did not make Europe what it is today.  Evil people made the policy to destabilize Europe at a G8 or Bilderberg or Bohemian Grove style meeting and then passed the orders down to the Evil middle management (read: politicians) who carry out the secret plan with a public-facing front story of "it's to aid a slowing population" or "they need our help" and "think of the children".
             </p>
             <p>
              We can say that masturbation is the reason for these policies no more than we could say masturbation is the reason for the Patriot Act...  Because elected officials aren't carrying out the wishes of the general population.

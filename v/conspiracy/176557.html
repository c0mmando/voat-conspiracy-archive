            Is it possible to create a shill-proof venue? I'm no math wizard. A lot of thought has gone into Voat and I'd like to see it succeed. Hopefully it can be tweaked in a way that allows us to leverage against those trying to control the social discourse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like you said reddit is great for things of no consequence like car photos and taking part in the popular shaped narrative. When any venue starts to gain enough traction there will be attempts to take it down or control it - steer it down less dangerous lines or paths that are easily marginalized. That's what happened on r/conspiracy - we got flooded with the accounts designed to be highly inflammatory and highly visible so that people could point at r/conspiracy and say 'look, there go a bunch of antisemites and bigots, there is nothing of value there'. Those who might me making the beginning steps to wake up are thus scared off by the blatant socially unacceptable trolls there to scare off anyone thinking of investigating further.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like I said in another post, Voat is limited. It cannot grow beyond a certain size without participating in the machine somehow. That's what got reddit. In some ways it's a victim of its own success. Once you have to start paying big bucks for hosting and start acting like a real business to survive, things change. Go publicly traded and that's it, you're done for, you are now under the control of the machine. Don't go publicly traded, and you're going to have a hard time paying the bills every month. It's a real catch-22 and it's done that way precisely to ensure anything that gets big enough can always be controlled.

             Growing a BI system and thwarting gaming of the system is a mature science. The theoretical guys at SharePoint are a decade ahead of the software. I'm just stealing their ideas, but I'm convinced that a system can be secured against manipulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Consider IMDB. It is hard to manipulate IMDB because they expose a large amount of granular data. I recently uncovered a manipulation of the voting for the Movie, "Soaked In Bleach". If I had access to the IP's, I could pinpoint the military base or PR firm that initiated the hit... without IMDB even being involved. Every thing like this that we do makes it more difficult to manipulate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DOWN vote being shown is a KEY indicator I used to use on Reddit to detect manipulation... so they took it away.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm glad Voat has that... but I want more countermeasure tools.

            very simple guys, USE your downvotes. that is what they are there for. Call out the troublemakers and paid slimebags, and do what they do, take them away from a main discussion thread. Make them waste their time. And all that while, keep downvoting. I just did similar in a link I just shared. Call them out, they are human, they cannot resist trying to one up us. So attack them and drag them away. Hope this helps.  the eample i am talking about is here.

            is the limits that the mods were forced to create to please the reddit mods. We shouldnt try and put limits here, it will only destroy this subverse. Let the upvote/downvote be the judge.

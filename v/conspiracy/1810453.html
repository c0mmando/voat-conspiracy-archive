            If this is the case, why do my photographic color correction filters work exactly the same as ever despite some of them being made in the 1950s &amp; 60s? surely they'd be the wrong strength and/or colour temperature, the #85's in the Wratten scale wouldn't be correct anymore, I'd find that only 85C got used with the A and B being too weak or something like that. I'm not saying I'm right and I'm happy to be proven wrong, i'm just sayin the first thought that came into my head in response to the title.

            <p>
             Do you have photographs that have the sun in them from decades ago that you can compare to more current photographs with the sun (using the same filter)?

              I have photos back to '68. None are actually pictures of the sun but all the outdoor ones use the sun as the only light source, there's literally thousands of them here. My father was a very keen amateur photographer, almost turned it into a career, and documented just about every picture he ever took so I know what camera &amp; film was used, aperture, exposure, filters, location, date, time etc for well over 90% of the 300+ boxes of slides and negatives. The majority of those filters are now mine, he's given up as he doesn't see down the viewfinder too good anymore. Photos '54-'68 he still has somewhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm currently looking at a box of slides of us on holiday in Italy, 1970, shot on 35mm Ektachrome F (Tungsten film) with the Zeiss Contina 2, mostly taken inside a hotel lobby but some campsite shots as well thru the 85A colour correction filter. I have the camera, the filter, and some similar film (out of date Ektachrome 100), but I can't develop the film tho so I can't do a proper comparison test, I can only simulate it with a digital camera set for Tungsten lighting, which I'm going to go outside and do right now, soon as I find the right step ring to put the Zeiss's old filters on one of my newer lenses. Not sure my "results" will mean anything but I'm trying! Theoretically if the sun has got brighter and whiter then I shouldn't get a good result with the 85A, should need to go to the B or C filters.

               I mean this change in the sun that people are talking about is from a softer yellow into a more bright harsh white light. I'm not so certain how much this will affect photography that doesn't directly include the Sun.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm interested in what you find since you sound very legit.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another interesting thing is that this change in the sun coincideswith the whole global warming agenda.

                Sorry about the delay in replying, I had to buy an adapter to make the 85A filter off the Zeiss fit on my modern lens, already had one but it was damaged.

                If the sun is the only light source in the photograph it would make a big difference. The sun's light does change colour throughout the day, becoming more yellow for an hour or so before sunset, an effect called the golden hour
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_%28photography%29">
                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_%28photography%29
                </a>
                which photographers have been using for almost as long as photography has existed. You could easily fool yourself into thinking this whitening of the sun is (or is not) real if you compare pictures taken during the golden hour to ones taken earlier in the day.
               </p>
               <p>
                Well I've tried to see a difference in the pics I took in tungsten mode thru 85A filter on 2 different digital SLR but there isn't one that I can tell. Unfortunately my experiment is not really too scientific, I'm not really comparing like with like so any results can't be considered as conclusive either way. Kodak have re-released Ektachrome film at the beginning of this year so it should be possible for me to do something actually comparing like with like at some point soon, perhaps even the same time of day and season. It would be nice to put the Zeiss to good use again instead of just storing it in a cupboard.

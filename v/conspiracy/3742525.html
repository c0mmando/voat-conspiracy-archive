           <p>
            Still trying to figure out what is going on.  Current theory:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The virus is real.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It was an initial biological attack, either by China or USG.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If the biological attack was by the USG, then it was designed specifically to impact those of Asian decent.  (Japanese were probably fed an antidote in their food supply.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If the biological attack was by China, then it was designed to first inoculate their population, and to then cause economic damage to America.  If this is true, more biological attacks will follow to further weaken America... (might explain why USG still has America under quarantine... to root out elements that would further infect America).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The ships in CA and NY are all about ejecting those "corrupt elements" that will hamper war or have been working to culturally destroy America.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It seems China has been at war with America for some time, in the form of influence, corruption, and IP theft.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              China's moves into the South China Sea is probably the spark that started the move by the military and USG.  It signaled China's real intent was to upset the status quo.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              China is using the CV as cover to kill any dissenting voices within their country in preparation for war.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              When the CV lock down ends, USG is going to do everything to get American productivity up to speed as quickly as possible.  We are going to see an economic boom where all the Chinese products are replaced by American production.  The standard of living will decrease, but everyone will have work. (Think of the American production increase after Pearl Harbor, and you'll get the picture.)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            In other words, these moves are in preparation for hot war with China.
           </p>
           <p>
            NOTE: Don't judge China or USG, simply observe the moves.  When war happens or is about to happen, nothing matters except the survival of you, your family, and your country.  Blaming your own leaders or country when war is happening is dumb.  Trials and judgement can come after the fighting ends.

             So those are most of the things that I am seeing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did some intel work in LA when I moved out here but have since lost all my network contacts when I took a job 10 years ago now.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not seeing the point of the ships when we have so many other ways to move people around faster.  Esp in LA with a huge base near by.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm on board with the bio-agent.  There is the rumors of the Israelis and Canadians meddling around over there. One person I was talking with said there was even an exchange of fire near that BSL4 in wuhan.  Not sure I believe the gunfight story but over there things are covered up so fast.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for martial law in LA.  I can't really imagine how effective that would be.  I do think most foreigners here would roll over willingly.  I mean look at the shitholes they come from. NONE of these foreigners have fight.  The ones that do seem to have been genocided for it.  If they knew how to fight for their own countries they would have fixed their country.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm around several big ethnic groups and they don't seem to be giving a shit about what is going on either right now.
            </p>
            <p>
             The economy probably WILL be stronger after this.  BUT!!! i am really worried about all that debt we just shouldered.  That is going to weigh on us pretty heavy.  After WW2 there wasn't quite that much debt in the hands of the elite.  WW2 debt was much different.   We have no savings and this is wiping out a lot of people.
            </p>
            <p>
             So is the west coast vulnerable?  Is there going to a general loss of freedom?

             I tried to reach out to hams and got nothing.  I don't like HAMs.  I have a license and hated being in the community.
            </p>
            <p>
             LEO was telling me they are making arrangements to work around outages if they happen.  That was about all i could get from him.  Reached out to my friends who work on the network backbone and they said it was stretched pretty thin.  A surge might break things. But nothing catastrophic.

               it's a cult. they all think they are elite assholes.  It was super weird when i got my license. These weird boomers would come around and shake my hand "welcome to the club" (wink wink)

               they also police the air constantly. they don't have anything better to do than list for someone breaking the rules and report them.  And they hate new technology.  software defined radios and cool new tools would make things so much better.  They fight encryption instead of pushing for it against the gov.  CA is basically shutting them off because they don't want to deal with them anymore.

               take the classes.  don't get a license unless you want to transmit to other hams.  buy the gear and hide it and use it when people aren't around.

               radio operators are super super dangerous.  You can bring a city down with radios. Literally.  Once you get a license you are on a list.

            any astute 'conspiracy' detective will like this list:
           </p>
           <p>
            When an event like this occurs it is not unusual for alt media pundits to be offered cash payments by the feds to 'just leave this one alone' or 'spin it to this narrative' and this would be up there on a scale of that 'importance' you can see a similar effect with 'Alex Jones' pundit 'Paul Joseph Watson' who constantly steams 'Feminist and Islamist'  posts particularly when something of importance is happening:
so with that
            <strong>
             possibility
            </strong>
            in mind:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             He took a long time (in his own posting pattern) to post a video. i think I counted 3 days from first news.
            </li>
            <li>
             he disabled comments on the video (never seen that before)
            </li>
            <li>
             he spun the 'Psyop' narrative way before it started to be popular by 'Social media bots'
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              He says 'he just can't get up there to cover it' , what? , like there are too many other government armed standoffs happening?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I asked him here on Twitter:
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>

             6. which DAM IT he has since deleted (with me not getting a screen dump) if anyone can help with this that would be helpful, but question remains why delete it?? it was a pretty strong response.

            Summary:
           </h2>
           <p>
            yeah yeah i get the 'Gun law' psyop angle, however it's largely irrelevant, fact is guys were/are getting 'picked off' and charged as 'terrorists' for essentially managing land. 
so here is my response to all the 'psyop' bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            yep ok so what? 
it is a 'psyop' what now?
           </p>
           <p>
            the alternative seems to be:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             be picked off and charged as terrorists then thrown in jail one by one losing all rights full Communist style.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            or (even if all the 'spin' is correct)
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             fall into a 'psyop' which leads to some sort of armed resistance Marshall law blah blah , so what? you are getting your land stolen and you are getting charged as 'terrorists' and thrown in jail. ha ha
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            so when they (Govcorp) gets away with that with zero response, you think they will just say:
           </p>
           <p>
            " Oh well we were able to easily take those suckers land and they did exactly zero so i guess hey ! our job is done here lets stand down and institute a fully 'democratic' equal system constitutionally based and give it all back' grrreat test though ! "
           </p>
           <p>

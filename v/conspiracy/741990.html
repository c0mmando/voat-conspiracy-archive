            Interesting, I have come across two very obscure websites, one says Eminem is now a clone/was swapped and the other is about Stephen Hawkings exchanged by a body double. Unfortunatly I did not save the links and cannot find them anymore...

            On the one hand, I can totally see cloning being a thing. We did it with a sheep, and a dog in 2005, and China just put out an article that says they are constructing a massive facility in Tianjin (ring any bells?) to clone cattle, racehorses, and pets.

             http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/12013158/China-cloning-factory-to-produce-cattle-racehorses-and-pets.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            With this knowledge I can definitely believe the US government already has the tech to clone animals, and probably for awhile.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, cloning is a very...very delicate subject. Were this to be public, people would
            <em>
             flip.
            </em>
            <strong>
             Out.
            </strong>
            The implications, the "playing god," the
            <em>
             actual
            </em>
            use for the clones? And of course, why would there still be kidnappings and such if they could just make clones? Clearly they don't work as well, and when Papi Rothschild wants to diddle a boy he wants the real thing.

            Very odd.  Never heard of that guy- isn't there an illness where you think people around you are fake doubles?  Maybe this is that.

             I upvoted, but I think psychiatry is a crock of shit (no offense to you or your idea), so I don't think capgras delusion explains it. I think the majority of mental illnesses are poorly explained and not derivative of what the medical professionals tell us (e.g. problems not coming from where they say).
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway
            </p>
            <p>
             I think he could be telling the truth, or had been lied to.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also think he could be spreading disinformation to cover up the actual kidnappings the government.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I don't think he is really famous enough to be shilling on purpose, especially with his last album (WATER: We Are The Enemy Really). Check these lyrics out:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Not a human, not afraid
             </p>
             <p>
              I will not comply, I will not obey
             </p>
             <p>
              See the plan is to depopulate
             </p>
             <p>
              But the body can overcome anything, fuck what a doctor say
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Born a slave to a tyrant
             </p>
             <p>
              It's goin' take more than just petitions and riots
             </p>
             <p>
              Are we headed for a future of being indebted to credit
             </p>
             <p>
              Hopin' the next leader elected will trump the one we beheaded
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Could be the next Tupac, or a pale imitation?

              Water is a sweet album and I'm gonna have to look closer into cloning. It was a theme with me back about two years ago when I followed the satirist/disinformation knob formerwhitehat's WordPress blog. Always with the clones.

              I usually agree that psychiatrist are usually overly eager to diagnose and prescribe, but I don't throw the whole idea/field of science out the window.

              At any rate it could explain his behavior, as other humans have done something similar.  Or he could actually be an alien, or it could be a publicity stunt as you said. It's all super odd.

               Sorry for this very late reply, but despite what I said, I didn't mean to imply the entire field is a fraud. Rather, I think many "modern" illnesses are an invention, built upon a an existing foundation of true illnesses/something misunderstandings.

               Frankly, with the corruption of our current scientific world, I can't imagine things were any different hundreds of years ago. The only difference, to me, is that the information of history tells us those people (in the past couple thousand years) were generally the first ones to discover- as in study and research -most health problems.

               And also that humans were more valuable back in the day, when you couldn't mass produce crops or art.

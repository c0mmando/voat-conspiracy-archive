             how do you know that?  there is much speculation that the classes were moved to another nearby school a couple years prior due to the poor state of the campus.

            there is also no evidence that there were elephants and giraffes in the school at the time.

             Your logical fallacy is burden of proof.  We have been shown no proof that anyone was murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary on 12-14-2012. It is up to the person or persons making the claim to show proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you claim children were murdered there on that date?  Show proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             You want proof that no one was murdered there?  I can show you pix of no bodies all day long.

             Or you could prove that it happened like they asked. I'm honestly not on the conspiracy side of this argument but the original post asked for proof and you just side stepped the question.

             There is also no evidence that an elephant was or wasn't  there when someone was shot. What's your point?

            You mean the groups that are either non-white or anti-white?
           </p>
           <p>
            The establishment hates white culture because it's a threat to globalism. End of. All the so called "anti-establishment" people who want to sing kumbayah and deny race is a factor are as good as agents of the government.

            Yeah, as 33degree said: Divide &amp; Conquer. All the plebs join a team, conform to it and focus all their energies on it. In the end we all agree on most stuff, so it's mostly petty arguments IMO. It's stuff we agree on we should focus on, not our polarities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do we want 99% of people as slaves to 1%?
           </p>
           <p>
            My question is if the 99% are divided into 99 teams - they pick one themselves - and the teams are constantly fighting each other, will they even know they are slaves and this is all to entertain the slave owners and reduce slave population and chance of uprising?

            No. It's called Divide and Conquer. It's meant to keep people cannibalizing each other and attacking each other. Regardless of who is right and wrong they are just arguing over bullshit that doesn't matter. The War and Monetary policy is what's important to the real future of America but it will always be drowned out by race baiting and bullshit.

            The establishment likes such movements because as long as the masses are occupied with refugees and SJWs they aren't occupying wall street.

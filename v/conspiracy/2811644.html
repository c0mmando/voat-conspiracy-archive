<p>I\'m mainly fed up hearing Paddock was the lone shooter!

<p>But the most telling evidence for a staged event is what the swat team leader\'s recording showed. The judge ordered the recording made public due to a FOIA request and it shows the team breaching Paddock\'s door, finding him shot, searching and securing the other rooms, walking through broken glass everywhere and then! – then we hear the team leader calling op control: &quot;Shooter not secure, repeat, shooter NOT secure. All windows are INTACT!&quot; </p>
<p>For some reason, which the swat team leader couldn\'t explain, the team broke protocol and turned off their body cams before entering the staircase. Some grumbled, but all complied – except the team leader himself. This episode is also included in the released video recording from the team leader\'s body cam. It is publicly available by the judges order.</p>
<p>So tell me about it. Yeah, it\'s &quot;suspicious&quot;, very much so. But it seems the victims were real.﻿</p>
<p>huge cover up..multiple eye witnesses have made statements of multiple shooters.. some of the survivors who made statements and had proof of that fact or seen something or another shooter all have died under mysterious circumstances..not to mention the Bellagio and countless reports of shots  fired into the entry way..or the fact for the 3months leading up to the shooting there were numerous call ins of shots fired in various casinos. Michael Bennett (football player)was in 1 casino after a ufc fight..could the suspects have been doing call in and timing 1st responders and police?. definitely more then 1 shooter..definitely not a self inflicted gunshot wound..and if you look at the actual pics i would argue he was dead before the 1st shots fired..ohh and not to mention his room service receipts prove multiple ppl in his room</p>
<p>The purpose of  FBI controlled false flag events and their ilk, is to confuse, dull the senses and create doubt, so the herd won\'t know what\'s real, training exercises, or just plain fake. These events have been going on for years and none of them have been solved. Don\'t lose sight of the fact, that our government is totally controlled by a foreign government. The FBI, CIA and the MIC were lost long before JFKs coup, that took control of the rest of government. If one thinks that the secret police will break down and spill the beans, they are delusional.﻿</p>
<p>Multiple people put all those firearms and magazines in 32-135 and killed Paddock. Who ever brought that luggage up there killed Paddock and the real shooters did the shooting using other weapons and from helicopters. The cops shot the windows and the aviation fuel tanks after the shooting to bang a stiff patsy on violence at international airport, aiding and abetting, arms trafficking, and shooting the planes when he didn\'t shoot from 32-135 or 32-134 because the windows weren\'t broken IN BOTH ROOMS UNTIL AFTER THE SHOOTING WHEN THE COPS SHOT THE WINDOWS OUT AFTERWARDS. The cops know who the real shooters are and let them escape after doing the shooting AND HELPING WITH THE SHOOTERS AND SHOOTING ON PURPOSE. Helicopters were used and only cops, federal agencies, and cops have those. Room 32-135 has always been a distraction Stephen Paddock is a distraction. So don\'t pay attention to Paddock or 32-135 or 32-134 pay attention elsewhere because your being mislead by thinking 32-135 and 32-134 are even important.</p>',

            Wanted to thank you for posting this and for keeping with it.  This issue is far closer to me physically than is comfortable, and you seem to already have all the same information I do.  But yeah.  This has been pretty conclusively linked to something involving the Saudi's if I recall.  Something about succession?

<p>&amp; The Rabin Assassination</p>
<p>By Barry Chamish</p>
<p>Adam Parfrey, head of Feral House Publishing, kindly sent me his latest release, The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics Of Terror by David Hoffman. Different readers will find the book shocking for their own reasons but what struck me hardest were the uncanny parallels between the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah building on April 19, 1995 and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin barely six months later. It was as if the same planners were involved in both operations and this, in fact, may well be the case. Admittedly, the following parallels were drawn after only the first reading of Hoffman\'s book and since his thesis is complicated, I will have to be oversimplify his case. Nonetheless, consider the skeleton of the Oklahoma City plot drawn by Hoffman with my own research and conclusions about the Rabin murder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Timothy McVeigh served in the Marines and was sent overseas to Kuwait. * Yigal Amir served in the infantry and immediately after discharge was sent by an intelligence unit of the Prime Minister\'s Office to Riga, Latvia. - Once discharged and back home, McVeigh assumed a new personality, one that drove him toward &quot;radical&quot; anti-government organizations. * Once his assignment ended, Amir returned home, enrolled in university and became a campus &quot;radical&quot; organizer. - McVeigh was drawn to a paramilitary right-wing &quot;cult&quot; called Elohim City and was seen often with a leading ideologue of the group, Andreas Strassmeir. * Amir joined a right-wing anti-government organization called Eyal and befriended its founder, Avishai Raviv. - Strassmeir was an FBI plant imported from Germany to infiltrate the militia movement. * Raviv was a Shabak (General Security Services) officer assigned to infiltrate the settler movement and Israeli religious, right wing movements. - After the Oklahoma City bombing, the American government protected Strassmeir from implication in the bombing, despite his proven close ties to McVeigh, and quickly returned him to Germany.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the assassination, the whole legal apparatus of the Knesset, from the Justice Ministry to the State Attorney General\'s Office, protected Avishai Raviv from prosecution, despite his proven close ties to Amir. - Strassmeir established contacts between Elohim City and extremist Arab groups ultimately connected to Iraq.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raviv was widely reported to have established ties between Eyal and extremist Arab organizations such as Hamas. - Hoffman concludes that McVeigh was &quot;an FBI informer&quot; on what he thought was an assignment in Oklahoma City. That would explain why he surrendered so peacefully to a lone policeman on a deserted stretch of highway shortly after murdering 169 people in the blast.</p>

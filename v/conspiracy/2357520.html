            I don't want to be a spoil sport, but I think it is good to make a distinction here, least we become bigots.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are two types of Jews(Just to simplify, I know there are more) Torah and Talmud.
Jews that read the Torah Which to my understanding is the Hebrew version of the Old testament. They reject Jesus and his teachings, but they have been lead astray and follow tradition which was denounced by Jesus. These Jews might not be great, or even good, but they do try to do the right thing in their realm of understanding. They fight against the occupation of Palestine which is pretty good and they get beaten for their protests against war.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jews that read the Talmud, mostly known as the Ashkenazim also don't follow Jesus, but they also believe in child rape as stated in their unholy book, the Talmud. The also believe in murder and thievery. They believe in all the things that are wrong. The Torah Jew calls them Zionists and they are quite literally enemies with each other. Talmud Jews silence and persecute Torah Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally would help a Torah Jew who is in times of need as they are just mislead. Talmud Jews are the evil ones, the Zionists, socialists and the ones plotting. They are the ones that own media and money.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure most people here understand all this, I just want to draw a line and to show that not all Jews are bad. There are Christians that share in the teachings of the Talmud as well. They are all blood suckers, figuratively and non-figuratively.

              Good question. There are other people that also read and follow the vile teachings of the Talmud. It is a religion and you don't have to be a "Jew" or Ashkenazim to follow it. So a better question would be, "How do you know if someone is a follower of the Talmud?"
             </p>
             <p>
              Zionists come in all colors and through simple google sleuthing you can find lists of Zionists or Zionist shills. To make it a heck of a lot easier, Most Ashkenazim run things like the FED, all media, all subsidiaries of media, The control education, law and medicine. They will be in places you will never have direct contact. Zionist shills can be fair skinned or dark skinned and are usually direct puppets to the Ashkenazim/Zionists. These people will be in elite political roles and elite banking roles. Again, you'd probably never encounter one on the way Target.
             </p>
             <p>
              Really, the odds of ever being face to face with one of these people would be really rare.
             </p>
             <p>
              The standard "Jew" is really just a descendant of the name Gomer who were the Khazars. They adopted the name Jew, which is an invented word and not actually mentioned in the Bible from 1611 and before. So when I'm speaking of a standard "Jew" or one who follows that Torah, that is who I am talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              Torah Jews are the ones we will encounter from day to day. They can be different kinds of Torah Jews and believe many different things, but they have all been mislead by the Zionist Jews like the rest of the world has with thousands of years of brainwashing, also known as generational brainwashing. It makes it really hard to break out of the cage when every history book and everyone you know reinforces the lie for countless years. Anyway. These Torah "Jews" might not like you, but they won't try to kill you are rape children. They are just misguided. There is no real reason to hate someone that doesn't like you because they were brainwashed. If anything, after your research you might have pity on them. I know I do. If a Jew stood to defend Palestine, I would stand beside him or her as a brother. I don't care. We are brothers and sisters. The same for Muslims, and anyone else at our level. I would not stand next to the elite though, I know they are evil and like genocide.

               Yeah, I do remember that the term "Judaism" and thus "Jew" came from a scholar doing research for Constantine or something along those lines and simply referred to the many tribes/peoples in the area of Judea as Judaic or something and it stuck from then on.

            I'm a Heathen and I prefer to see crosses everywhere as opposed to mosques. If we have to have an imported desert religion I think we all agree that Christianity is the least fucked up of the two.

            Carry a pocket of rice with you if you’re being chased by a vampire. Throw it on the ground and the vampire (jew) must stop to count each grain (pick up each coin). Oh, and would you like to know the history of the Dracula myth in the first place?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dracula story is all about Romanian king named Vlad “the impaler” Tepes. His father was known as Dragul (dragon), because he was part of the European Anti-Muslim alliance called the Order of Dragon. His son Vlad the Impaler was known as ‘dragula’ (a son dragon, or little dragon). Vlad was send to the Ottomans as a political hostage for a peace treaty. He was essentially a slave to the Ottoman ruler. He lived among the muslims and learned to hate them. This is probably where he first learned about the Jews, their slave trade, and their constant alliance with the muslim world. Vlad III, “the impaler”, was imprisoned and often whipped and beaten because of his verbal abuse towards his captors and his stubborn behavior, while his younger brother Radu the Handsome was much easier to control. Radu converted to Islam, entered the service of Sultan Murad il’s son, Mehmed II (later known as “the Conqueror”), and was allowed into the Ottoman royal court. Later Radu and Vlad III had an epic brotherly feud.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad II, the father of the Impaler, Mircea, and Radu thought he could secure peace by giving up his two sons to the Ottomans. In December 1447, a rebellion was orchestrated by boyars and merchants in the marshes near Bâlteni against Vlad II, despite the agreements he had. This was a cruel and deadly betrayal against Vlad II. Allegedly behind the assassination was the Hungarian regent John Hunyadi (regent 1446-1453). When Vlad’s father was murdered by Janos Hunyadi’s orders, Vlad’s older brother Mircea was also murdered. Mircae was send as a political hostage to Vlad il’s political opponents in Târgoviște in good faith. There Mircae was blinded with hot iron rods and buried alive. To prevent Wallachia from falling into the Hungarian fold, the Ottomans invaded and put young Vlad III on the throne. However, this rule was short lived as Janos Hunyadi himself now invaded Wallachia and restored his ally Vladislav II of the Dănești clan to the throne. Vlad fled to Moldavia where he lived under the protection of his uncle, Bogdan II.
           </p>
           <p>
            In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. In a bold machiavellian move, Vlad III tried to offer himself as a political advisor to Janos Hunyadi. Impressed by Vlad’s vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred of the new sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former rival and made him his advisor.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1456, three years after the Ottomans conquered Constantinople (because Jews opened the gates), Ottomans threatened Hungary by besieging Belgrade. Hunyadi began a concerted counterattack in Serbia: while he himself moved into Serbia and relieved the siege (before dying of the plague), leaving Vlad III in charge. Vlad led his own contingent into Wallachia, reconquered his native land, and killed Vladislav II in hand to hand combat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad found Wallachia in a wretched state: constant war had resulted in rampant crime, falling agricultural production, and the virtual disappearance of trade. Regarding a stable economy essential to resisting external enemies, he used severe methods to restore order and prosperity. Vlad had three aims for Wallachia: to strengthen the country’s economy, its defense, and his own political power. He took measures to help the peasants’ well-being by building new villages and raising agricultural output. He understood the importance of trade for the development of Wallachia. He helped the Wallachian merchants by limiting foreign merchant trade to three market towns: Târgșor, Câmpulung, and Târgoviște, which made him very unpopular with the Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad considered the Jews and boyars the chief cause of the constant strife as well as of the death of his father and brother. To secure his rule, he had many leading nobles killed and gave positions in his council, traditionally belonging to the greatest boyars, to persons of obscure origins, who would be loyal to him alone, and some to foreigners. For lower offices, Vlad preferred knights and free peasants to boyars. In his aim of cleaning up Wallachia, Vlad passed new laws punishing thieves and robbers. Vlad treated the Jews and boyars with the same harshness because they were guilty of weakening Wallachia through their internal struggles for power.
           </p>
           <p>
            The army was also strengthened. He had a small personal guard, mostly made of mercenaries, who were rewarded with loot and promotions. He also established a militia or ‘lesser army’ made up of peasants called to fight whenever war came.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad Dracula built a church at Târgșor (allegedly in the memory of his father and older brother who were killed nearby), and he contributed with money to the Snagov Monastery and to the Comana Monastery fortifications. Since the Wallachian nobility was linked to the Transylvanian Saxons and Jews, Vlad also acted against them by eliminating their trade privileges and raiding their cities. In 1459, he had several Saxon settlers of Brasov (Kronstadt) impaled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad was also on guard against the rival Dănești clan, and some of his raids into Transylvania may have been aimed at capturing potential challengers. Several members of the clan died at Vlad’s hands, including a Dănești prince suspected to have taken part in his brother Mircea’s murder. Vlad condemned him to death and forced him to read his own eulogy while kneeling before his open grave.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, in the year 1459, Ottomans thought now that Vlad was soul ruler of Wallachia that he would bend to their rule. Ottomans wanted a tax from Wallachia. To pay this tax meant accepting the Ottomans as the rulers of Wallachia. So Vlad The Impaler refused. Well, the story on Wikipedia says that Vlad had the tax collectors’ turbans nailed into their heads. This is wrong and obviously censored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly muslims don’t wear turbans. Turbans are an Indian hat and muslims wearing turbans is an old Hollywood myth. Secondly, muslims didn’t use other muslims to collect taxes from the borderlands. They used Jews to collect taxes and be international diplomats. I’ve read many other sources that it was the Jews who got their hats nailed to their heads because they refused to take them off in front of him. This would explain why he wanted to nail the hats on to their heads. He probably would have killed them anyway, but he was kind of a man that liked poetic justice. The thing was that Vlad probably had knowledge of the relationship of Ottomans and Jews from his childhood captivity, and therefore didn’t trust Jews. He was a hostage, but he was also a spy send there by his father. He also saw what Jews and boyars were screaming about during his lifetime and didn’t trust them. He despised them, and thus had Jewish diplomats killed by nailing their hats to their heads.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vlad was real badass. In the winter of 1462, Vlad crossed the Danube and devastated the entire Bulgarian land in the area between Serbia and the Black Sea. Disguising himself as a Turkish Sipahi and utilizing the fluent Turkish he had learned as a hostage, he infiltrated and destroyed Ottoman camps. Later Vlad was later betrayed by the Hungarian and German boyars and merchants (aka Jews), who promised him weapons, armors, and men. Instead they captured and imprisoned him. In autumn of 1462, Vlad and Matthias Corvinus spent five weeks negotiating alliances and battle plans at Brasov. After believing he had gained Hungarian support for his crusade against the Ottomans, a confident Vlad started on his way home to Wallachia. Unbeknownst to him, there was an ambush waiting at Castle King’s Rock, a fortress about six kilometers north of Ruck, barely inside the Wallachian state. On November 26, Vlad was captured by Matthias Corvinus’ own men and spirited away to Hungary.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neither his contemporaries nor modern day scholars can say why exactly Matthias Corvinus shifted his loyalties and betrayed Vlad. Vlad was imprisoned at the Oratea Fortress located at today’s Podu Dâmboviței village.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exact length of Vlad’s period of captivity is open to some debate, though indications are that it was from 1462 until 1470. There is lot of mystery about that period and what really happened because of the inner power politics and deceptions. Jews in Europe were the leading merchants. They had international connections. They sold slaves to Ottomans from their travels, usually stolen Christian children from a town that they were passing through. As we can see, the jews were hated by Christians all the time. And even back then, they had real money to buy kings and queens to get their own free. Sometimes the kings were just and punished them, but sometimes the officials helped the Jews because they had money and gold. I wouldn’t be surprised if Vlad had unknowingly started a war with the Jews by nailing their hats to their heads, and because of this the Jewish merchants and boyers conspired against him.
           </p>
           <p>

             A really interesting research project or book would dive down deep into vampire mythology and compare it to some "conspiracy theories" and history about Jews. Stuff like the vampires sucking blood have so many obvious comparisons: both rumors about ritual murders and sacrificing kids as well as rabbis sucking blood out of circumcision wounds. You can go on and on with many superficial parallels. A really good research project would trace the origin of some of these stories and see if they're linked.

              Many stories of vampires and witches eating children come from Romania, from a time when Jews were doing blood libel to the Romanians. I think goblin legends are also a stab at jews.

             Ever heard of blood libel? People have been accusing Jews of abducting Gentile children for literally centuries and it's pissed Jews off enough that they made their own term for it.

             Here's where it gets interesting. Tay Sachs is a genetic disorder where treatment involves blood transfusion. It's very rare. Unless you're an Ashkenazi Jew, then it's 1 in 3,600.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who would you take blood from if you needed regular transfusions? A population where the the disorder is common, or one where it is rare.

              Great comment. Yes. I've wrote in great detail about it. I'm certain its where vampire lore came from. To this day they use their abortion clinics to get baby blood and cells. For a long time children were going missing right before Passover. Rabbi's still bite the foreskin of a baby's penis then suck the blood from it, giving the baby herpes in many cases. This is legal in America.

            Jews are seeking eternal youth by injecting baby blood into their bodies. No, they really are -- I'm not even exaggerating. Wealthy Jews are paying doctors to inject them with the blood and blood products of young children and babies, because this blood has been demonstrated to have rejuvenating properties. This is happening right now. Where are they getting this baby blood? Ah, there's the question. Since none of those donating it are of the legal age of consent. But I'm sure the rich Jews have their ways. Just as they did centuries ago when they made a habit of abducting very young Christian children, torturing them, extracting all their blood, and mixing their blood into bread for their ritualistic feasts. Yes, that actually happened, although Jews have been denying it for centuries as well. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

             To bolster your point, there was a recent study where they paired the blood systems of old and young mice. The old mouse got younger and the young mouse got older.

              Yes, yes, I agree with your post.  I did not mean to make light of it.

             <p>
              You are right.  The Vatican, Jesuits, Jews, Freemasons, Rosicurians, etc. all believe the Christians are idiots and deserve nothing but contempt.  They believe the Christians worship the lesser god, while they worship the higher god, Lucifer.

              And I do not doubt that Bram Stoker wrote that story with Jews in mind.

              It is interesting to go back and reread the Brothers Grimm stories.  The original stories are very dark for the same reason- certain groups have always been kidnapping, screwing, ritually sacrificing, and eating children.  This is where the phrase "blood libel" came from, as you probably already know.

              In the video, some of the marks sound on recovered bodies are consistent with Kabbalah.

              The Nag Hammadi Library is also an interesting read.  There are similar stories in it.

                 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin">
                  (wiki quote for basics)
                 </a>
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats. (According to some versions of the story, the promised sum was 1000 guilders.) The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all but one drowned.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Despite the piper's success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum (reputedly reduced to a sum of 50 guilders) even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul's day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned dressed in green like a hunter playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town's children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave and were never seen again. Depending on the version, at most three children remained behind: one was lame and could not follow quickly enough, the second was deaf and therefore could not hear the music, and the last was blind and unable to see where he was going. These three informed the villagers of what had happened when they came out from church.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Other versions relate that the Pied Piper led the children to the top of Koppelberg Hill, where he took them to a beautiful land, or a place called Koppenberg Mountain, or Transylvania, or that he made them walk into the Weser as he did with the rats, and they all drowned. Some versions state that the Piper returned the children after payment, or that he returned the children after the villagers paid several times the original amount of gold.
                 </p>

               I concur. Cabala is used by the jews to create Golems - brainless slaves hypnotized since childhood to carry dangerous tasks by the jews orders. It is important to add that Christian Bible says that the end of the world is when the dead will walk the Earth. Golems are dead alive zombies, because of the dead brain since childhood. At the end everything makes sense, isn't it? Have you noticed how many Golems / ZOmbies are there out there in politics, msm and Hollywood?

                Yes, I am friends with a lot of them.   I tried to help them, but they just don't get it.  To them, Trump is the anti-Christ.

                The Satanists like to flip things around- good is evil and evil is good, natural is unnatural and unnatural is natural.  This is why they are pushing the whole soyboy, transgender thing.   Now they are pushing sex with robots, which is unnatural.

                A well-armed middle class America will destroy these people.  It is already happening.  I am prepared, but waiting for my time to jump in.  There is finally a just war to be fought, and I am not going to miss it.   Both my Grandparents fought in wars, and they got used by the bankers without realizing it.

                 I like knowing things that keep myself safe. In university days I was lucky to find lots of people to exchange informations with. Unfortunately the Golem phenomenon is still unknown to the masses. It is considered just a harmless myth. I was able to find depictions of the Golem only in two episodes in XFiles and Supernatural. The jews keep this secret still very well.

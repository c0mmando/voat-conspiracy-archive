             I can almost understand why she would want an audit. 1% in the general seems way to low for her, I was expecting at least 2.5%.

            Jill was either threatened or bought to be the front for the recount.  There is no benefit for Jill and Shillary's people want to make it look like it is not Hillary trying to flip the election with a recount that they will try and rig.

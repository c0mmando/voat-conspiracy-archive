            Its also what was meant by the "post-factual world" description from the last Bilderberg meeting (I think) - people no longer care about facts. It's all about fee-fee's.

            I do what I can to explain some of this to family and friends.  I get varied reactions from, I just want to be left alone to you spend to much time reading things, or who cares. Even the ones that actually take the time to listen and agree with me are at a certain level of placidity. It's very rare for me to find someone who actually gets fired up talking about these things.

            I think both. Over a million people took the time to go sign a petition to remake the last season of Game of Thrones, millions lost their shit at Daenerys going full psycho in the 5th episode. Or, just look at the number of people obsessed with the latest Kardashian gossip.
           </p>
           <p>
            Feminists care more about a girl dressed in skimpy armor in a video game than they do young girls being abducted and sold as sex slaves or the nonstop abuse and rape of women across places like Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and London.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stuff like that, it's right in front of us. There is no attempt to even hide it. Post-conspiracy is exactly what this is now. People just don't give a shit about the important things. It's part of the overarching method to just generally get the populace to stop caring about all the evil shit that is done. Feed them mindless dribble and get them worked up over stupid crap like fantasy tv shows or pronouns.
           </p>
           <p>
            The conspirators are distracting the mentally weak who either are just too stupid to care or those who just intentionally distract themselves as a kind of mental defense mechanism.

            The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist? No. The greatest trick was convincing the world not to care about him existing.

             I was wondering if the conspirators are usind drugs or hypnosis on people. I don't really know why other people don't understand what I do. I know the conspirators have abnormal brains since childhood, because of brainwashing techniques, but I am not sure about millions of average people.

              Using drugs and hypnosis on the millions of more average people is totally necessary - that's the thing. You don't need to target people on an individual level. It's overly complicated and messy compared to just breaking down culture and spoon feeding them kike concepts. Why do you think in education and i'm not just talking universities but stuff as early as kindergarten they now have people teaching 5 year olds about trannies and other kike shit?
             </p>
             <p>
              The younger someone is the more impressionable they are. Though I will say you are onto something, I do worry about some of the shit that goes into vaccines, I'm not talking about stuff like the polio inoculation but about shit like how they tried to force anyone in public school including even 18 year olds at the end of highschool to get vaccinated for whooping cough - a disease that for older children and adults might not even get noticed by them as anything other than a cough that stays for relatively longer than a regular cough.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't even want to start talking about the fact that it seems like every minor illness they start prescribing drugs left and right. Have a headache? Immediately take an Advil, upset stomach? Here's 5 different stomach medicines. When I was a kid if I had a headache I was told to take a nap, if my stomach hurt my mom made me chicken soup, if I had a soar throat we gurgled vodka and spit it out.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it's not just drugs, it's fucking food too. 'Masculinity is toxic' men, you should eat more soy and avoid foods that promote testosterone production. Candy is great! Eat more candy goys! Sugar sugar sugar! Anything that gets you addicted or distracted is good for them.

               I remember old black and white movies, where there were radio antennas used to send hypnotic signal to brainwash the population. Today it's known that the 5G radio signals can effect brain function. Anyway, there are many movies about population being kept under some kind of mind control. I think there is always some truth in the most crazy sci-fi movies, also it shows that other people were thinking about collective mind control way before me.

                Can't just do -one- thing. What if someone eats home grown food? What if they refuse vaccinations? What if they refuse most drugs? What if they were homeschooled? What if they live far from any signal tower or underground or something like that?

                Chances are even if someone fits into one of these things or more they don't fit into everything. One way or another they will try to get us controlled. Everyday that 5G shit is expanding, and that's probably the most serious threat because everything else is relatively easy to avoid.

                 Maybe it has to do with water. I don't drink tap water and I am pretty conscious. Maybe it's a coincidence.

                  I've never drunk tap water as it actually makes me a bit sick. People say they don't notice it tasting 'off' but when you grow up drinking fresh water or spring water you really notice how bad tap is.

                   As far as I know, tap water is second hand water, therefore it lacks the natural minerals contained in fresh water.

                    Well technically anything that goes through a faucet is 'tap' so by itself it's not anything but a method of transportation. In Armenia where they have Lake Sevan which is the largest body of water in Caucasia and one of the largest freshwater lakes in all of EurAsia all the water comes directly from the same water that supplies the lake, or many of the other natural mineral springs that come out of the mountains. It then gets transported by pipe to each individual home. No filtration is needed because the mountains/underground asks as a natural form of filtration without removing most of the minerals thus creating 'fresh water' and probably the only tap water I've ever actually enjoyed. It's how most large ancient civilizations got their water - it's one of the reasons why practically any old city is built directly next to a source of freshwater. The Romans among others built aqueducts and canals to supply cities that were built farther away from the source but back then they didn't chemically treat the water but for the most part they were fine anyway because chemical/industrial pollution wasn't really a thing back then.

                    The problem with most other places is they use recycled water or have 'filtration plants' - where the water is treated with a ton of chemicals. Not only is it often recycled 'second hand' water as you say but also it's been filtered through various chemicals. If they wanted to do something to the population that is by far the easiest way.

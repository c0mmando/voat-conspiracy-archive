<p>&quot;1.3 The Bilderberg Group</p>
<p>The Bilderberg Group is an annual invitation-only conference of around 100 
guests, most of whom are usually influential politicians and big business. 
The title comes from the location of its first official meeting in 1954 in 
the Bilderberg Hotel, Arnhem, Netherlands. Its main office is now in Leiden, 
South Holland, the groupâ€™s current Chairman is Etienne Davignon, a former 
Vice President of the European Commission. The original intention of the 
group was to further the understanding between Western Europe and North 
America through informal and closed for media and public meetings between 
powerful individuals. Of course, thatâ€™s not what they are doing. If you 
look through the guestsâ€™ lists, you can find some very popular names like 
David Rockefeller, Donald Rumsfeld and George Soros. Lists differ each year, 
but thereâ€™s one name that remains there for years - Henry Kissinger, a 
former Secretary of State, who rules the Bilderberg Group and rules the 
world. Bill Clinton, the Arkansas Governor and 1992 presidential nominee went 
to Baden-Baden and attended the Conference on June 6 1991.&quot;</p>',

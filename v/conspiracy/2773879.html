<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be as open-minded as possible, truth is often more crazy than a fiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No conspiracy theorist is always right, always find more sources to confirm facts or theories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don\'t jump to conclusions prematurely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for subconscious biases, sometimes one &quot;wants&quot; something to be true, and then will see facts selectively or make false conclusions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Faked/staged events</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Any event - and especially one which had big impact and leads to changes in society or traumatized society to some degree - might be staged/faked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Famous living person might actually by already dead and replaced by a double.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful when reading biographies of people in Wikipedia, some claims might be false, either by mistake, or intentionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful also with photo evidence, quite a lot of photos are fake/photoshoped.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CIA membership</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a person is known to work for CIA, any part of his biography might be faked, and events surrounding him or her can be staged. He can also be a &quot;front&quot; for some CIA project, which is publicly promoted as his creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His partner might also work for CIA or the whole partnership is staged, and also the previous point might apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of his parents are known to work for CIA, previous points also apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If LSD abuse is prominent in the story, previous points might also apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Finding if the person belongs to the ruling elite or works for them</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a person has a family relationship with the famous &quot;13 bloodlines&quot;, he will probably belong to the ruling elite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the family relationship is not apparent, it is still possible by out of wedlock birth, name change, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another sign is if he practices Satanism, or belongs to a secret society like Freemasons, Knights of Malta, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to find out if the person is jewish. If so, the probability of being in the ruling elite is higher.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>MK-Ultra/Monarch programming</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a person works for Hollywood or in popular music, he/she might be a victim of mind-control practices. Also applies for some agents, politicians or &quot;socialites&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind-controlled person might unconsciously do things one would not normally do, and has a so-called handler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are people who stops at no evil. Never assume that certain extreme kind of evilness &quot;cannot exist&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Money flow</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For big events like wars, try to find out who financed them and who benefited financially in the end.</li>

            Also, everytime you spot an obvious shill, look at what they're pushing, and memorize it as possible disinfo. Look at what they're opposing too and memorize it as possible truth. Of course, this could be used against you due to reverse psychology but just something to keep in mind.

             13 families is just a term, I was primarily referring to a book
             <em>
              Bloodlines of Illuminati
             </em>
             by Fritz Springmeier. He names those most powerful families, but more importantly, he describes in detail how they operate and what are their goals.

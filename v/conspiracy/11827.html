            NOt too many, but I live in San Antonio. It's hard to find people who care, let alone people who care
            <em>
             correctly.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me explain: if you
            <em>
             care
            </em>
            but your sources are people like Ann Coulter or Bill O'Reilly, how much truth are you actually getting?

            How many people do I know who are awake?  Well, I would have to say pretty much everyone I associate with is awake to some degree or another.  The rabbit hole is pretty deep so I am using the word 'awake' liberally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much of this has to do with the people I choose to associate myself with.  Late 2006 when I started to rub the sleep from my eyes was very lonely.  Friends thought I was nuts.  Wife thought her husband fell into the bottomless pit of the internet, and my parents damn near disowned me.  All of this changed once I got involved with We Are Change AZ, and the freedomsphoenix.com crew.  Shit that was over seven years now.  Holy crap!  I'm getting old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every year we have a camp out.  It's a blast.  We call it the jackalope freedom festival.

            I know quite a few.  Some are people that have just said something that I thought was surprising for them to say, some are people that have changed their minds after seeing evidence, and some are people that have changed their minds after coming to the realizations on their own.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are more of us out there than most people think, and I find comfort in that fact.

            I owe my skepticism to my mother, who taught me to always question authority, despite being a minister.

            I'm from Brazil so I haven't met anyone who fits your description :) but also, I haven't met anyone who is really interested in searching for the truth. People are like zombies, when I'm among people I hear they talking about all sort of things, just nothing related to any truth. And this week I argued with my mom about vaccines and she told me the truth doesn't matter :/

            My own parents recently said it didn't seem to matter who they voted for really, they are recently retired and previously moderate right wing voters, I was pretty shocked and most impressed. Most of my friends are musicians and general weirdos so I know a fair few.

            it seems to me that there are a lot of people i meet in a passerby capacity (servicing them at my job, and the various other ways our society brings us together without having ever truly met someone) that say things that make me feel like my opinions are not un echoed! on the other hand, i have been very frustrated with my friend group, who prefer surface popcorn understandings of how our world works, or understand the nature of our situation, and actually EMBRACE it, or simply say "well i cant do a thing about it"

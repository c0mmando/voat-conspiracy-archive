           Unfortunately people have become completely brainwashed by liberal "values" of the so called "tolerance". Instead of boycotting Hollywood and deploying another McCarthy against the obvious conspiracy, people sit on their fat asses saying "oh well - I respect different views", or "it's just a movie", or "everybody have different tastes".

            Now this is a tough call.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know they are commies, we know they do propaganda, we know this from history
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time, the old jew club in hollyweird chased away the new talent for the writers guild, so now they are out of fresh ideas. Those kids went off to steam to make shovel ware games. As a result they have a writers shortage that they do not know how to over come. Hence the comic book movies and the remakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            the economy is speaking too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ask a five year old who would win in a fight: superman, or Goku?
           </p>
           <p>
            It is always GOKU. He is the utter opposite of what Hollywood wants the kids to like: A straight, cis gender family man who works hard for his super powers.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we have seen is that hollywood is steadily losing the kids due to the "japanese cartoons" Their attempts to butcher the translations fail because of the Internet fan base.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think is is so much pushing an agenda, as it is disconnection from the American people. Futurerama hit on this with the network executive robots that "underestimate middle America". 20 years ago when we did not like what was on TV, we where fucked when it came to entertainment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now we have a world of choices, literally a world of choices, and hollywood does not know how to cope with this. So they are doubling down with what they know, and all they know is their California audience.

            I do believe hollywood is total propaganda, but what about Chris Pratt, Dwayne Johnson, or Vin Diesel, to name a few alpha males?
One of my beefs with hollywood is they claim stereotyping is wrong, yet they are the very people who decide who to cast in a role based on who THEY think would fit the role. That seems to be the very definition of stereotyping. It's just another case of, we'll tell you what is right, even if we have to be hypocrites to do it.

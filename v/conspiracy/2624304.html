<p>Let\'s start from the beginning, before the election, but first I want to start off with a few statements that we can all agree on.  First, Hillary Clinton was and is UN-electable.   Secondly, it\'s widely known the corruption that circles around her and her group - can we all agree on this points?  Good, because here is where the Donald  and the great awakening faggots will start to realize they are winning, just for the Zionists.  
</p>
<p>With the above being said, let\'s take a look at the 2016 presidential election.  3 DNC Candidates (Clinton, sanders, and Lincoln something) vs the 20 or so RNC candidates.  Let\'s get this straight, Hillary gets to run against a senior citizen socialist jew and a retard and the RNC had potentially 10 actual candidates, all whom who could have beaten Hillary in any election.  even faggots like jeb bush or ted cruz.  
</p>
<p>Remember, we all agreed, Hillary is UN-electable.  So if we can look at this objectively, you have a DNC race (proven to be rigged for Hillary) and a mad dash of RNC candidates knowing that whomever win\'s the RNC wins the presidency.  Remember, Hillary is UN-electable.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNC elects Hillary as candidate well before contest even starts</li>
<li>Hillary is UN-electable</li>
<li>RNC has a layup of a race (if they get past committing suicide :)</li>
</ul>
<p>With it already being fact that Hillary rigged her side of the election, she needed to rig the RNC.  The only way to do that was to plant her own candidate and one that could shake up the RNC big time.  In walk\'s in ** LONG, LONG time democrat ** , Donald Trump, who is the loudest person in every room he goes.  It is also very important to point out that; </p>
<ul>
<li>DNC is currently rigged (UNDISPUTED FACT)</li>
<li>Trump is a democrat who decides to run as a republican with nearly 20 candidates already, not 3 for his current party. (UNDISPUTED FACT)</li>
<li>Trump is friends with the both Bill &amp; Hillary. (UNDISPUTED FACT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we turn to the actual respective party elections/debates.  Trump demolishes people like Jeb and Rand as well as Carson.  Hillary on the other hand is being destroyed by Bernie because, Hillary is UN-electable.  During this time, we begin the Wikileaks email\'s and it starts to become transparent that not only had the Clinton camp committed election fraud but were proactively promoting Donald Trump within their media ranks.  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Long time democrat and long time Clinton friend begins to win the RNC bid</li>
<li>Wikileaks begins to distribute evidence of mass election fraud - (UNDISPUTED FACT)</li>
<li>Clinton camp is secretly promoting Donald Trump through the media - (UNDISPUTED FACT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we go on, I\'d like to point out what the media and both parties would do to a candidate that non of the wanted.  2008 Ron Paul.  If Donald trump was not the one that the elites wanted to win the election, they would have simply blocked him from events and not even mentioned a word of him in the press.  
</p>
<p>Now as we get into the presidential election race we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>DNC candidate that committed election fraud who has spent more money than any previous presidential race before her</li>
<li>RNC candidate (former democrat / friend of opponent) who was actually being secretly promoted by said opponent </li>
</ul>
<p>So here you have a DNC candidate who stole her respective seat from Bernie and is spending more money on her campaign than any previous individual in any political election before her.  Donald on the other hand has spent only $10 million of his personal money and the rest comes from his supporter\'s contributions.  Does it really?  Ask yourself, with it being fact that Donald Trump is being secretly promoted via the media arm of the elites, how much does all that free press he received cost any other candidate?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hillary spends more cash in the history of the presidential race than anyone</li>
<li>Donald Trump receives nearly 80% of all media attention which may equal or be greater than the dollar value Hillary spent on her race</li>
</ul>
<p>Any rationale mind can put the pieces together; Hillary did rig the election, but when you rig an election, you don\'t rig one side of it, you rig it all.  With the Trump election, has Hillary really lost?  Let\'s look at some interesting facts since nearly 2 years has past.</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign meddling in our elections has only gotten worse thanks to Trump\'s loyalty to Israel</li>
<li>Trump has successfully, with his election has divided the nation and kept everyone fighting among ourselves versus purging real issues in the world</li>
<li>Are you sure Trump\'s foreign policy is different than Hillary Clinton\'s?  
</li>
<li>2 years and there has been no ACTUAL investigation into the mass election fraud of Trump\'s long time friend </li>
<li>Trump has not eliminated fake news by signing Executive order to repeal government propaganda from the media (The Smith-Mundt Act for you illiterate faggots)</li>
<li>Trump has only removed longtime democrat\'s from SOME positions of power and replaced them with longtime republican\'s cut from the same cloth.  How\'s Jeff Sessions working out for everyone?  Or all these kangaroo court congressional hearings??</li>
<li>Imran Awan will see no jail time</li>
<li>DWS will see no jail time</li>
<li>Irregularities with the Diebold voting machines will see NO investigation </li>
<li>blatant false flags (which would be stopped if you remove propaganda from the media) like Las Vegas, Charlotte and the such.  
</li>
<li>THE FUCKING LIST GOES ON AND ON</li>
</ul>
<p>Occam\'s Razor you guys.  The simplest explanation is the answer, this is 4D chess that this asshole is playing, he was the controlled opposition in case the Clinton\'s lost.  Hence why nothing has actually changed, same predatory banking and insurance laws, never ending foreign wars and now we have a population which could have been united to finally change shit at each other\'s throat.  In short, Donald Trump is playing all you faggots that support him being you are supporting the very regime that you say you fight.  Another few more controversial points that will keep you all in-fighitng like zionists like tommy robinson, or some other bullshit story like that and it will be the next election.  Stop being mindless drone\'s, you aren\'t fighting the good fight or supporting the poor underdog candidate.  You are supporting a zionist elitest piece of shit who is no better then clinton.</p>',

           Occam's Razor you guys.  The simplest explanation is the answer, this is 4D chess that this asshole is playing, he was the controlled opposition in case the Clinton's lost.  Hence why nothing has actually changed, same predatory banking and insurance laws, never ending foreign wars and now we have a population which could have been united to finally change shit at each other's throat.  In short, Donald Trump is playing all you faggots that support him being you are supporting the very regime that you say you fight.  Another few more controversial points that will keep you all in-fighitng like zionists like tommy robinson, or some other bullshit story like that and it will be the next election.  Stop being mindless drone's, you aren't fighting the good fight or supporting the poor underdog candidate.  You are supporting a zionist elitest piece of shit who is no better then clinton.

            Dude Hillary expected to STEAL the general election as well, check black box voting dot org and the claim that she actually stole 4 states. Also they tried and could not do to trump what they did to Ron Paul because of Trump's star power.

             False. Trump was the only one that could make Hillary look like she could have won the election.  Ron Paul had millions of followers and they silenced them all over a decade ago.  Imagine what they can do now

              Ron Paul actually did win the Republican nomination the last time he ran. What people forgot is that someone said OH FUCK NO and changed the rules for qualifying THAT NIGHT to say he can't be there.

                I remember certain networks moving the camera to just the right angle that the other candidates made it look like he wasn't there. Then there was that shit show debate where he was asked very little of the questions while the rest had plenty and the person asking said questions talked the most of all.

                 don't forget the media blitz during and after.  i remember how they used to push romney (who was like 3rd at the time) and some bottom dweller.  it went on for weeks where they wouldn't even confirm paul's existence.

                  Yup. I also remember a certain Paris Hilton goes to jail event that was a totally awesome reason to cancel one debate outright that Ron was to be in. That or it was held with 0 TV coverage.

              There are a lot of articles about it they call it fractional math, I would hate to do this because Alex immediately turns people off, but the fact is Deb Harris is a liberal but cares more about the election legitimacy than politics. She is also by far the leading analyist of voter fraud in the world. So here she is explaining the fractional math to Alex in a way that's easy to understand. If your not an Alex fan just ignore him and listen to what she has to say..

            You need to learn that putting "UNDISPUTED FACT" after you say something isn't a magical shield from being wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an example:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             LONG, LONG time democrat ** , Donald Trump
            </p>
            <p>
             Trump is a democrat who decides to run as a republican with nearly 20 candidates already, not 3 for his current party. (UNDISPUTED FACT)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is flat out wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Donald Trump has a history of switching parties back and forth, often to whichever party is NOT in the White House.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>

             Furthermore, to continually prove my point, trump has been for the majority of his life been a democrat.  now, only trying to rebut a point which you are now failing to do so does not invalidate my argument.  but thanks for making my point that much more clear faggot

               Dude is less than 80. ~20 was spent as a child/teen doing child/teen things. Politics usually becomes slightly interesting after the age of 25. That leaves 50-55 years and -31 off that is definitely a little over 1/2. Also, feel free to post proof by finding his official voting registration record if that is even publicly available.

                This isn't some deep dark secret. This is well acknowledged history. Strange that you call openly available facts "bullshit", yet your strange math where you can't vote before 25 somehow slips under your radar.

                   Private voting records tend to stay private. Unless he releases the info himself, all the sources are obtained illegally or are fake. The US operates on secret ballot. The people with a public voting record should be those acting as elected representatives (this means Congress, various state legislative groups).

                     I don't pay attention to what people say. The only one that actually matters was logged in the voting booth (there are reasons for this, people used to get beaten into voting for X group, thus now they can say what ever the fuck they want and vote how they please).

In India, what does he represent?

            I expect that anyone who could fight to a real estate empire, must be hardened through corruption surrounding him.   But something is different here.  There is Far more going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The change here, is on a far grander scale.   This is an end of an epoch.

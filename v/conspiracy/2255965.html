            Not sure if you know this, but it might help explain why you're having trouble finding that spot again. Google maps uses different images of the land for different degrees of zoom. This means that while looking at any given spot, zooming in one click will actually show you the same place, but at a different time. In certain rural regions one tick of zoom might represent a 6-12 month change. This effect can make it really hard to find things again, even if you knew exactly where to look.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope this helps.

            The capitol city of Astana is clearly being built for the Freemasons and elites. Just YouTube the entire city is covered in esoteric symbolism everywhere. This theory has a lot of merit to it because it is not just in China that massive new cities are being built in anticipation of a influx wealthy people.

            It will be a grand scale Paperclip operation, I bet US, China and Russia will love to get some white immigrants. China is on the way to become Orwelliam as fuck.

            I can answer this one, though you may not believe it.

            The Chinese have an odd cultural habit.  Remember that they were not originally capitalists in our sense of the word.  When they buy brand new real estate, they often refuse to move into it.  They lock the door and leave the unit empty - because if you move into it then the unit is "used," at which point it's perceived purchase value is less in their way of thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            This exact same empty unit phenomenon is seen in Toronto waterfront condominiums, in brand new buildings.  The condo units are sold to Chinese investors.  Less than half of them are ever occupied.  They are locked and kept as pristine as the day they first went on the market.   There are thousands and thousands of such units now.  The Chinese consider these units as still "new."

            I took the high speed rail from Beijing to Shanghai about 2 years ago and learned a lot of perspective from the people I was traveling with. Beijing is roughly 21+ million people and Shanghai is roughly 24+ million. Los Angeles plus New York don't even equal one of those cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            In between Beijing and Shanghai are huge cities going up that are completely vacant. You might see a dozen construction cranes in Los Angeles at a given time but these project have upwards of 20-30 cranes putting together dozens of clusters of buildings all approximately 40-50+ stories tall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why? China is going to take the farm/rural land away and put their populations in to buildings for easier control. The rooms/floors will be divided based on how much you currently own and your current family's needs. People are going to cheat and lie through their teeth as is the custom along with bribes, fraud, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            OP's claim that these cities are being made for fleeing elite I am not so sure about. There are enough of these cities being built that I would not be surprised if some are for elites. You have to keep in mind there are 1.5 billion of them so they could just be anticipating housing everyone. I saw another one of these building clusters in Xi'an which is interesting because there is a ton of really ancient history there.

            I was just thinking this lately.  I'm not sure it's for the "elites", though, but the genocide survivors.  Notice China isn't falling for no banana in the tailpipe.  Begging China to accept "refugees" is futile.  They don't seem to be participating.  So who does that leave?  People of means who don't want to see their women &amp; childre  raped, &amp;/or starved to death.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suspect that China wants the best survivors there.  They see an opportunity to take the cream from the top.

            Immigration can help you if you actually have standards (or better yet, freedom, which requires quality).

             YEP.  China was working behind the scenes on this plan with same Elites who are destroying Europe and Canada. This is Rothschilds 101: being in front of events THEY are controlling.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're also right about who was going to fill these cities. Not top tier Elites, but middle tier 5th Column members like Police, bureaucrats and businessmen.
            </p>
            <p>
             All these places are remote, indicating China and wanted to keep a level of segregation from the indigenous population.

            Yes.  This was part of OBOR and Silk road. Take the time to listen to London Paul on Sirius report as well as Rogue Money on YouTube.  Also get up to speed with Laroche PAC and Harley Schlanger and Jim Willie and Catherine Austin Fits.

            No no no. China built those so that the thier upper class has someplace to go in a nuclear war. They are planning to have a nuclear exchange with us, and just take the hits. Thier upper class will retreat to these cities and they'll just set up machine gun lines and gun down any poor that survive the blast and try to head that way.

                 Don't  take my word for it.  Check out the Sirius report, Check out Rogue Money, Check out whats going on with the Silk Road and OBOR.  There are so many sources available to back up what I am saying and so few backing up some crazy claim that China wants a war. Yawn.  If anyone wants a war its the US.  How many overseas bases do we have world wide?  How many bases does China have?  I will answer the second one for ya.   1  .  Really go look at my sources. Smash them with other real world sources if you can!  Really!   Go stand toe to toe with London Paul on Sirius Report academically.  Also, see if you can take apart Catherine Austin Fits from the Solari Report.  She is another major source of mine!  She has many interviews available for free on Rogue Money, Forum Boreals on Youtube.  I am not forming my opinion with my own mind.  I have massive heavy hitters in international banking, economics and political science that shape my views with data and information.  OH!!!   and I am white, in my early 40s semi retired and self employed of German and Irish decent dating back to before the revolutionary war on my moms side and just after the civil war on my dads side.

            It's an economic effect.  I used to understand it better but the key thing to remember is that builders and the government are not the same people.  It's not like the chinese government is planning each building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically the Chinese government pays builders to construct rooms.  The more rooms the more money they get even if nobody buys.

              As a policy its retarded but that it would produce that economic effect isn't baloney.

              ADVChina covered it and he showed a small village next door that was taking advantage of the same policy.

               wrong.  the only effect created by the building over SIX HUNDRED of this ghost cities has been massive debt and a giant real estate bubble.
              </p>
              <p>
               'What it means is that China’s massive stimulus from 2009 to 2011 sunk money into projects that are generating little or no returns. The continuing gush of credit allowed companies to paper over these losses by covering their bad debts with new loans…But whatever the size [of China’s indebtedness], it’s now big enough that the system needs colossal amounts of liquidity even to keep above water.'

            You should do a little bit more research.. But I lived in China and it was the most eerie thing to see. Visit a mall that was just completely empty. There would be a family every five minutes but it was ghostly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Definitely saw plazas that were just empty but obviously built for higher class. They’re just further trying to separate the rich from the poor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being there, it felt like nobody was middle class. Just rich or poor. It was a sad fun time.

            There is; you’re just retarded. China constructed them for rich Chinese (as well as the cities in Africa) to use as refuges for when the communist Chinese government collapses. The differences in style are done to be tourist attractions, as seen in many of the currently populated areas of China where knockoffs of the same appear.

            When has that ever been alleged? The goal is a jewish nation from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates devoid of all non-jewish life, and a global communist principality of mulatto slaves that is ruled over by the United Nations, with the capital in Jerusalem.

               But as I explained and as you explained it was definitely just made for rich. Idk why this guy screams JEW as his winning arguement. I don’t trust the Jews but I don’t go around soundings like a blabbering idiot calling anyone that disagrees with me a shill or Jew.

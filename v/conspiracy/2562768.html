             Foreword:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll notice many are prefaced by the word,
            <em>
             'Project'
            </em>
            , typically by the CIA or other international intelligence agency.  This may give you the idea that these are just 'typical operations' of our government.  After all, "the world is always at war and you need spies".  Or do you?  Especially in a technocratic world where everyone can talk to everyone, around the world.  I challenge that assumption.
           </p>
           <p>
            May I remind you that the definition of conspiracy is two or more operating in secret to cause harm.  So when the CIA assassinates world leaders in secret, it does harm to them but not to US citizens because they are operating on our behalf.  In this way, we justify their bad behavior. I want you to reevaluate the "causes harm" part behind their behavior.  By deposing dictators and playing chess with the planet, have they really made us safer?

              : a Phillipines-based, three-phase attack planned by Islamists Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed for Jan 1995 with funds ostensibly from Osama Bin Laden and Hambali--Bin Laden's SE Asia analogue.  They planned to 1) assassinate Pope John Paul II, 2) blow up 11 airliners in flight from Asia to the United States with the goal of killing approximately 4,000 passengers and shut down air travel around the world, and 3) crash a plane into the headquarters of the CIA in Fairfax County, Virginia.  They were foiled by their own screwup in manufacturing explosives and starting an apartment fire, where they were planning the attacks [A]

                 : Operation LAC (large area coverage) was a US army chemical corps operation that dispersed microscopic zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnCdS) particles over much of the United States.  The purpose was to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents.  Anecdotal evidence suggests there were adverse health effects--of course mitigated by US gov agency reports which are to be trusted always (911 NIST report, Warren report).  The wikipedia article continues, "the use of ZnCdS remains controversial and one critic accused the Army of "literally using the country as an experimental laboratory"".  This is solid proof of chemtrails and because of the widespread scope of the dispersal (most of US), chemtrail doubters such as topmind types have no leg to stand on anymore.

Dutroux was arrested for kidnapping and raping five girls and severed an exceedingly short sentence and released on parole with government pension.  He used sleeping pills he received from his psychiatrist on his further victims in a pornographic rape dungeon with assistance from his wife and at least one other accomplice; starving their victims to death and burying their bodies in a garden.  He was again arrested for six months while his wife managed the rape dungeon.  He was arrested a third time with his wife and accomplice Lelievre, and police found the victims' bodies including former accomplish Wittingstein, and a huge stash of pornographic videos.  A total of 4 conspirators and 7 victims in this sex/murder ring, but questions were asked about the Belgian Justice system with respect to how investigations were botched in allowing this to happen, though the conclusions drawn were that Dutroux benefitted from corruption, sloppiness and incompetence.^^

As in the Oxford, Derby, Rochdale, Rotherham and Telford prosecutions, the abused girls were almost all white and the gang were of Muslim heritage, but were Somali rather than Pakistani. Some were drug-dealers selling heroin and cocaine, while others were described as "well-educated men with good prospects".  The gang coerced the girls into sex with small payments of money, gifts of drugs and alcohol, and by persuading them that having sex with many men was part of "Somali 'culture and tradition'".

The emails also have lead to many other pending intrigues surrounding Clinton, including one surrounding her lovely familiar and right-hand-woman Huma Abedin's connections to the Muslim Brotherhood and arms deals, as revealed when these connections were tied in with emails discovered by the FBI on Abedin's husband and sex offender Anthony Weiner's smartphone.  Finally, there is a pending intrigue being called 'pizzagate' whose alleged codewords and pedophile connections are peppered throughout these emails, with attachments that are provocative and suggestive of a larger occult plot surrounding John Podesta, Obama, Clinton, Lady Gaga and their millieu.  These emails have been DKIM certified by Google^^

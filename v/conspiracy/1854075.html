            The only way I am going to be satisfied that this phony Russia story is truly honestly investigated is when the murderers of Seth Rich and possible murder of his fellow DNC staffer, Joe Montano who died "suddenly" last July are found and charged. Wikileaks says the FBI did not even bother to interview them about the source of the leaks and they did not even investigate the computers which we so called "hacked". In other words-there has been NO investigation-just talking points.

            In all seriousness, we can no longer trust anyone, anywhere. I really think that total and complete transparency of the government's ongoings is the only way for anyone to have any confidence in the government anymore. Information should be available, real time, online, similar to how wikipedia is (I really really admire how the new page is up and running to show where all the gov dollars are spent, whether or not it functions and is accurate is questionable, but it should have been done AGES AGO!). I realize that my knowledge is limited in understanding how proceedings go through our system, but the system is broken. It's time to let it go and try something new, something that there is no way to worm yourself out of things that you have done. I don't give a flying fuck if you didn't mean to. If you broke the law and you're in a position of power, you no longer deserve the trust of the people or the world any longer. "I didn't mean to" and "I didn't know" means you are incompetent. 
For example, with Hillary's email server. Nothing else considered besides secret data on a personal server. It's against the law, and she knew about it. Nothing else needs to even be said about it unless you want to pursue further charges. But the fact stands that she isn't capable of holding trust of the people in a public office, therefore she shouldn't be able to hold any office, ever again. Not even practicing as a lawyer.
If all the emails and bank account information between all political persons throughout the US and the world were open (as they surely have access to all of the citizens'~), it would decrease the ease in which people are bought and paid for. It would end this unnecessary war on turf we have no business with beyond lining the pockets of said elites. Would and could it still happen? Yes, but under the public eye, as well as foreign and domestic FBI/CIA offices, it makes it mighty more difficult. 
Just my ignorant 2 cents.
And no, Meimou, I don't believe the Russian narrative. But some do. And I can't blame them for it, because look at all the other crazy things that have happened. When considering the things that have happened, if you aren't reading and aware all the time from non MSM sources, how could you not be concerned.

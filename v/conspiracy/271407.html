            First of all, why does money have to be involved?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hosts should host because they want to support the community, not because they think they might be able to use the community to generate a profit for themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, why advocate for a partially distributed social network that still leaves power in the hands of the few?
           </p>
           <p>
            Aether is fully decentralized. Everyone is responsible for the network.

            You can't just make up a new crypto currency and then "auto-convert" existing currencies to it... It doesn't work like that. Someone would have to be selling you this voat currency for another crypto currency, e.g. bitcoin.

             actually you can -
            </p>
            <p>
             source: decentralized economist.
            </p>
            <p>
             The currency could easily be issued, there is a number of ways it could be activated with full nodes gaining a "reserve" then other % distributed to nodes, If the Devs wanted they could literally mine the currency in a few blocks and issue it like "Reddit gold" to "Buyers" (donators) paying the % to full node operators.-
            </p>
            <p>
             there is about 100 different ways this can be achieved.
            </p>
            <p>
             as you seem a little "sweaty" re the non exclusive talk of "Bitcoin" sure, the full node could run off a script side-chain to the Bitcoin BC.
            </p>
            <p>
             if this system progressed the 'Vota" crypto could be run off a side-chain the 2p2 would run off this chain and the 'vota' woudl be issued in exactly the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Here is where you are getting confused from an economic stand point:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               You believe that 'Vote Devs" need to buy "Bitcoin" to give to full node operators.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               That is silly, Bitcoin Devs do not run Vote.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               'Vote devs' can issue their own token, just as Reddit Devs did re "Reddit Gold"
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               The thing that makes the 'Vote" token valuable is the actual tangible asset (that is the forum) nothing makes Bitcoin valuable in this case.

              Okay, sure you can issue your voat currency in exchange for other crypto, what I was saying is that it wouldn't just magically have an exchange rate and "auto-convert". And there wouldn't be an exchange already set up to convert your voat crypto into other crypto should you want to do a return of sorts. From your original post's wording, it seemed like you expected all crypto to be universally convertible.
